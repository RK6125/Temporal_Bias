reddit_2,"Any words of wisdom? So I am working at a sporting goods store that has a sandwich shop inside and have been working this job for two years. My supervisor has only been in my department for one year and she has tried to put me down if I don't have enough time to finish stuff and it is left to be finished the next day. She has done some other stuff like going off for 45 minutes to an hour without telling us where she is going and not doing her job 's responsibilities. She has also denied one of my coworkers medical- necessarily breaks that she has a doctor's note for. The thing is that she has done the running off and not doing her job when she was in her previous department. Now I've notice when my manager does the sechduling, he only schedules me one day a week to work with her, and it has been usually Saturdays, if I work that is. I also work in other departments when they usually need the extra man power. I have also applied for other positions within the store and one is under the same manager but different department. Now I have been told that our manager and the store manager is aware of the stuff that she is doing and are planning on having a meeting with her, but I know that she has lied to get herself out of trouble before. And she has also told another coworker that if she is fired she will pull the race card (she's african-american). So what I am asking is that should I report this to my company's hotline or just wait it out?

reddit_9,"Lost another doc to depression This one was also a family member: a cousin who was just finishing his residency. In the med school I am associated with, it's the second trainee suicide this year (earlier was a student, and now a recent graduate) I don't know what I'm looking for here. I think I already have a pretty good feel for what we're doing wrong. Anyone who's seen a colleague, especially a trainee, suffering from depression and needing help knows full well how the gossip goes. I'm sick to death of having to defend trainees who need time or help, to associates who can't seem to understand that needing help isn't weakness and taking time to recover from illness doesn't impact your ability to practice. We can be bad even about organic illness, but in residency I had two health problems. One was organic, and I had a single minor hiccup in getting it dealt with. The other was mental health (postpartum depression) and I had to skirt close to legally threatening a preceptor who found out and seemed to think it was somehow not just her right but her duty to report a transient health issue to the residency program (despite it having been resolved a few months earlier, when I sought and got appropriate help during my parental leave). We suck at this. If anyone has any insight into how to make us suck less, I'd love to hear it. I'll bring it up to those who might be willing to listen after the losses we've suffered.

It's fairly reputable in the cybersecurity realm if nothing else. It is a private non-profit that is regionally accredited (i.e., not a diploma mill). The degree program itself is newer and seems to focus on preparing graduates to be project managers for software projects because it has quite a few accounting and management classes. I have a couple of concerns 1. What makes a company want to hire me over a programmer that has been with them a while and shown some leadership experience? 2. Is 'software development' a poor man's software engineering? Would I be better off transferring to Arizona State's ABET accredited program? Or is this degree the health care management of the software world, where those specialists have replaced senior doctors in management? Looking at the curricula, the software engineering degree has a large focus on high level math instead of the (more practical?) project management/business courses.

I'm also a man, which I understand is uncommon in nursing. I live near Boston (Somerville), which seems to be the mecca of hospitals for some reason. I see nurses everywhere, so I assume the job market is good, but I don't really know. I have some money saved up, enough to support myself for a few years and pay for a cheap school. I reached out to an old friend of mine who is studying nursing and they were able to answer some of my questions w.r.t. schooling. From what I understand, so long as you pass the licensing exam, whether you get an associates in nursing or a bachelors, once you get a job you're pretty much in the same position. I was thinking I'd knock out the pre-reqs at a community college, then get an associates and take the licensing exam. Now, the questions: Does what I've said so far seem generally reasonable?

I am updating a report done in 2005 and am stuck with interpreting the results. initial 1986 work determined usage cycles would occur below 1000 therefore no fatigue analysis required. operationally, it was found that we exceed the 20% MAWP threshold quite regularly (~800 occurances in 2005 and 1000 currently) 2005 analysis states a usage factor, U of 0.30 using ""next level assessment methodology"" and that the vessel is acceptable. 2005 analysis appears to contradict itself as the stated cycles would suggest usage, U=800/1000 + ##/1000 + ##/1000 = ~0.80. I believe as I am over the 1000 screening condition, I am obliged to perform a fatigue analysis but if there is a factor for the type (b), 20% mapw condition, then I can scale this raw number and will end up with a usage factor of ~40%.

There's also a lot of data to back up how much more efficient less working hours can be (with some contries placing maximum weekly hours laws of 30/35).

reddit_130,"Isn't it illegal to refuse service based on gender? (my experience with waxing salons) I'll try to keep this brief: I'm an artist and have been subsidizing my income by working as an art model for a few years. Because of this, I have to take extra steps to be fully groomed. This involves waxing and shaving. Because there are certain areas that one can not easily reach on ones body, I decided at one point that I would pay a professional to do certain things for me. I got turned down by about a dozen (no exaggeration; It might have been more in fact) salons that refused to provide the service for men. One woman actually said to me, ""No, we don't do Man-zilians (Brazilians for men)."" I was basically given the boot by tons of places that said ""women only."" Turns out most of these salons don't like to serve men because they think we're all a bunch of perverts coming in for the wrong reasons. It was near impossible, but I had to get it done. I spent almost a week and a half looking for a place, and it was getting incredibly embarrassing for me (this was what discrimination actually feels like). I finally found someone who would provide the service to me. side note: She was nice, but what I found ironic was that while she was performing the waxing [we had a lengthy discussion about news], the topic of Rachel Dolezal came up and she said something about how women already have it much harder than men.

reddit_133,"Men denied a legacy. Is there a consequence? Young men are concerned with their future. Old men are concerned with their legacy... And unless you're an artist, inventor or captain of industry, for most men their legacy is their children. Young men obey laws and live up to society's expectations mostly because they have hope for a future. Old men obey laws and live up to society's expectations because they hope to preserve their legacy, the family's honour, their children's future. But what if old men have to face the knowledge that they shall have no legacy? No kids... Either because they got taken away or because they were afraid to have them in the first place, given a society rife with anti-father sentiment? What then? If denied a legacy, then what do old men have to lose? An old man with no legacy sees no percieved downside to expressing his rage - perhaps violently... And with no consequence to an inexistant family, there's no consequence to himself (if his death is inevitable and imminent anyways).

She said she didn't think I was a pervert or anything, somehow knew I was a nurse, and just explained that exposing herself in front of a guy made her feel uncomfortable, but that it's not my concern, it's hers. She then showed me that she brought some kind of hoop covering so she could watch her kid but still feed her infant. I thought it was nice of her. Thoughts?

Just to explain: I have a PhD, I have about 6 years direct industry experience in addition to my degree, I started this job in February. I'm also the only woman in my department (engineering). There are about 130 people in the department. My boss is a Cali hipster. Nice enough in person but he continually minimized my experience and expertise (he recommended an engineer 10 years my junior to be my ""technical mentor""...sure, I can learn something from that engineer, but hardly in a mentorship role). I was passed over several times as a lead on various projects (because I lacked experience according to them, even though I had direct experience in that particular field...and knew the customer) and was instead assigned as a supporting role on different, smaller projects. At one time, he actually sent me off to make copies of an agenda instead of attending a meeting with a customer. In short, it was insulting. Anyway, I reached out to my network, got a couple of interviews, settled on one company, and am about to accept their offer.

Additionally, some female CS friends from school would put on a full face of makeup for interviews, even if they usually didn't wear any or usually only wore minimal makeup.

I am never included on people's plans, I am never invited out.. Nothing. Even when they are sitting and making the plans right in front of me. Maybe it's because I'm still kind of new (1 year)...but there are people who have been there less time than I that get invited out. Maybe it's because I'm a guy in a female dominated profession. Maybe it's because I work swing shift. Maybe it's because I'm white and working in a predominantly black hospital. Maybe everyone just fucking hates me. I honestly don't know. Most people seem to enjoy working with me and seem to like me at work. This is something I've dealt with my whole life. I've never felt included on plans (barring a small group of really close friends) and always feel like an outsider. I'm so fucking miserable and lonely. It's making it really hard to go to work because people sit around and talk about the last time they all went out. They all post pictures of shit I wasn't invited to on Facebook. They make plans right in front of my face and don't even bother to ask if I want to come out with them. I think I am going to ask my manager to switch me to night shift (although I am TERRIFIED of working nights) because they seem like the stronger team and they all seem closer outside of work compared to days and especially swing shift.

I am a mechanical engineer with a couple years experience in industry working in design with two separate companies. I've done 3-4 large prototype projects with varying degrees of complexity and varying degrees of disorganization. I've found what works for me to manage projects and keep a team moving forward but I'm really curious how the rest of you keep your projects, large or small, organized and documented. Specifically I wondered; - Assuming you have a concept that you are relatively sure will work, do you run a prototype through your ERP/MRP system? Do you have a separate database for engineering projects or do you create part numbers, BOM, etc in the production instance? - If you work outside of the ERP/MRP system how do you maintain tracking, costing, BOM, and inventory? - When in the project do you attempt to capture your cost rollup? When does this consideration come into play for your design process? I know that there is no real black and white answer as it varies so much with the scope of the project. I'm just curious to everyone else's experience. Thanks so much for your ideas!

I call him out on his paranoia and say that what you stand for is what you stand for and there's no fear that can make someone defend white nationalism...

I'm well-respected in my department, my reviews are really solid, and I'm given many opportunities to travel, work on high-priority accounts, do public speaking, etc. My company has been very open and vocal over the last several months about a conscious initiative to hire more diverse candidates, both in our work force and in our talent on-air, which I happen to completely agree with. As a major media company, I think it's important that we represent all voices, and that people of all backgrounds can relate to what they see when they turn on our network. The way my department is structured, there is no way for me to move up to the director level without one of the existing directors leaving - but there are about eight, so turnover does happen. About six months ago, there was an opening, which I applied for. I was told by the hiring VP that I was absolutely qualified and that I'd be an asset to the team, but they ended up hiring someone from outside the company, who happens to be of a minority ethnicity.

I've lived in Vancouver Canada for a few years now, but I still often find it difficult to understand what people say. I worked for a few years back in my home country and luckily found a job in Canada that's related to what I did before. I have 7 years of experience and I think the pay is not bad ($100k), but I'm not sure if that's reasonable amount or not. I feel like it would be difficult to advance in the company with my level of English. Manager roles would be a hard call. My improvement in English is quite slow and it doesn't look like it'll get any better in short time. Can you guys please give me some advice/tips for an asian immigrant who's not fluent in English?

reddit_481,"Request for advice: taking on a 2nd job on top of my day job. I was hired as a data scientist for a large insurance company. Turns out, they actually have NO serious, long term projects going on. My management is constantly caught up in endless political games, have no technology background whatsoever, and seem incapable of building a serious tech team / product. My day job now simply entails building very small scale toy projects once every few months, and aiding my managers in the politics by providing tech advise / material on demand. In any case i have a hell of a lot of free time in the office, on the order of 95% of my work day. I have been thinking of using this time to work a second job. I can probably land a remote / contracting gig with a bay area company, and do the work in my office during the day. Is that a good idea? A few more details in case they matter: i am based in a first world Asian country (one of Japan / Hong Kong / Singapore), and am payed decently well in comparison to the local tech market (120k USD base). My employer is a very large, old school insurance firm. They require me to declare any other jobs / positions i hold, but i don't think this will be a problem. I do intend to declare it, but i don't think anyone will bother to ask details. In the unlikely event that they do, i'll say it's a corporation created for my dad / wife / sister's future business, and that i'm on it because of administrative reasons. Do you think this is a generally good idea? Are there any risks i am overlooking? Of course, I will never use my employer's equipment.

I go to a good university but I felt completely lost; I couldn't even declare a major since I was so indecisive. I've been doing a bit of soul searching and am trying to find out what interests me. Up until now I felt like I just always did my schoolwork and then hung out with friends and family, so I legitimately didn't feel like I had any interests. I wasn't particularly obsessed by any one topic either. I've been trying to read more and listen to podcasts, and open my mind a bit. Anyway, at this moment, I've managed to come up with a list of general topics of what I find interesting. Healthcare: The current plan is to go to medical school. But I'm interested in healthcare in a broader sense. I care about women's health in particular, so ob/gyn is a thought. I am Latina, so I care about helping bridge disparities in healthcare including language barriers for my community (others too, but I don't know enough about other communities). Latino Issues: I care about immigration policy. As I mentioned before I care about giving Latinos access to healthcare. A path to higher education. Mentoring for other Latinos to be aspiring physicians (if I decide to become a doctor). Getting more Latinos involved in politics and exercising their voting rights. Education: I've thought about becoming a teacher, but I don't know if this would be the right job for me. I'd maybe like to be involved in policy? Others: Finance, Tech, green jobs/environmentally friendly, non profits (big one), working in politics to help shape policy (maybe a think tank type of situation?).

The next day I felt like my manager was kind of avoiding me and it dawned on me this weekend that perhaps I came across as racist. Most of my coworkers are African American, and I'm not [I'm Asian].

reddit_560,"Interesting Detail: False Accusation in Italian Law >Knox was accused of falsely implicating Lumumba and charged with calunnia (slander), which under Italian law is knowingly blaming someone for a crime they didn't commit. In 2011, Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman gave Knox a three-year sentence (which it was ruled she had already served), as well as ordered her to pay Lumumba's 22,000-Euro court costs. (As of 2015, Knox has not paid Lumumba, who was incarcerated for two weeks for Kercher's murder before being exonerated, whose bar faltered in the wake of the negative publicity he received, and who consequently moved to Poland, the homeland of his wife Alexandra Beata.[73] The Italian state also later awarded Lumumba 8,000 Euros in damages, but he rejected this to pursue a claim through the European Court of Human Rights.[74][75][76][77]) Also interesting: >In 1989, Italy reformed its inquisitorial system, introducing elements of U.S.-style adversarial procedure. The changes were intended to remove an inquisitorial continuity between the investigatory phase and the basis for a decision at trial, but in practice they took control of inquiries away from police and gave prosecutors authority over the preliminary investigation.[63][64][65] Although they have considerable authority over early inquiries and discretion in bringing charges, Italian prosecutors do not customarily use their powers in the aggressive way common in the US system.[13][66] ...

I tried the research online, but most of the information that I could find just said that it was a difference in the job title naming convention between the US and Europe. In the US, a Controller is typically a middle-manager with probably a minimum of 7 years of experience (although many companies might prefer someone 10-15 years of experience).

Do we have anyone on this subreddit who is a case of an international transfer especially someone coming from a non-native English speaking country? How did you assimilate in the new culture? It takes years to really understand all the references, right context, American psychology (behavior drivers) to do that small talk and make a 'real' connection with the prospective client who would 'like' you and 'want' to work with you. This becomes more important especially if big part of your role is going to be selling your firm's services. Of course partners are there to help, but I will certainly need to overcome this challenge on my own if I want to be successful at my firm.

It's difficult to explain, but students learning sometimes seems to be the last thing on the directors and owners mind. The job is not ""easy"" but it's not as much ""paperwork"" (lesson planning, student evidence, backing up my teaching, formal observations) as there would be in a public school. Less of the known modern pressures teachers have. I walked in my first day to a fully furnished and supply stocked classroom. This school is located in a predominantly Chinese area, and all of my students, TAs, other teachers, and school owners are Chinese. They have traditional views of schooling, which I do not agree with. I went through a 5 year master program for special education and graduated 2 years ago. First year I was a TA, and now I am here. I am really getting nervous at the thought of having a ""real"" teaching position where I have to build a classroom from scratch. The task seems so daunting right now. Is this how all teachers feel their first few years teaching? This is actually a little difficult for me to admit. All I've ever wanted to be is a teacher, I've studied hard and have experience, but I KNOW there is knowledge and skills I lack.

We are paying rent money to his parents as they've paid 6 months in advance to the owner. SC wages are much different than NY, and $2500 a month for a 2 bedroom apartment is astronomical to me. So, naturally, just to protect myself, I wanted to take a look at the rental agreement. I'm actually mentioned in it but never signed anything. It's just business right? Well, the boyfriend's parents are deeply offended and think that if I truly loved/trusted my boyfriend that I should trust them too, and also because I met them one time to judge their character. As far as I'm concerned, they're still strangers to me, I don't know them. They could fuck me over in a heartbeat, who knows? I said that I would not move into the new apartment without getting to see the agreement. So they're taking this very personal and have now said they will not allow me to look over the rental agreement until I present to them 2 forms of ID (license, passport) because, to them, ""If you don't trust us with the lease, we don't trust you either - that you are who you say you are.""

reddit_731,"Can a young man of 23 years of age with a criminal past and poor credit possibly have a brighter outlook for a future career? (Heads up, it's a bit of a read) So I'm a 23 year old male with a criminal record. I was once a very good kid and In fact enlisted with the us marine corps, 3.6 gpa in highschool and in great shape at the age of 18 before I spiraled into becoming a depressed, drug addicted young man quickly getting arrested for multiple marijuana charges, resisting arrest, and a controlled substance charge. I lost my chance with the marine corps, I haven't held a steady job until about 10 months ago I was hired at chipotle Mexican grill after sitting in jail for 6 months on a burglary of habitation which I'm now serving 6 years deferred adjudication with the possibility of getting off early. I've been doing what I can to meet all requirements of my probation and I'm actually close to finishing most my financial and community service aspects of my probation within my first year. I'm doing well currently at chipotle and recently received good news that I'll soon be a kitchen manager. Despite how well things are going now I can't help but feel depressed that I have nothing accomplished by now, and I feel like my future career in whatever I may study for in college will be hindered by my criminal past. I have a credit score of 560 with many medical bills that have gone into collections already. I don't want to continue struggling like this and I'm trying to find the best possible route to a better future. I know there can't be one ""fix it all answer"" but I'm asking you guys that may have a better insight to my current situation on how to go about with my current life situation and college. What could I even possibly study given my history. I know I can get my record sealed but that would be 5 years after I successfully get released from my felony probation. Any help?

reddit_744,"If you're offered a job through a recruiter, could the employer circle back to you later on? Long story short, I was offered a job a month ago. I ended up turning it down, but for some reason the recruiter insisted on doing the negotiations, and I'm nearly 100% sure that my actual salary requirements didn't make it to the company until the point where I turned down the job. I'm also convinced that this resulted in the company itself seeing this as a money grab from my end. The kicker is that the HR manager told the recruiter that had we ""gone in with this at first"" she thought they would have just offered it. Conclusion: Fuck this recruiter. Anyway...It's been over a month since they offered me the job. The job is still open, I know they're having trouble finding someone; the position is 60 miles from any major metro area and for the right price I was willing to drive it 3 days a week, but I imagine that there aren't many others, and especially not at the senior level I'm at. When I turned it down with the recruiter, I also sent a ""don't burn any bridges"" email to the HR manager, just mentioning that I feel like my requirements weren't accurately communicated and that it was my first time negotiating for a position through the recruiter and I was unfamiliar, etc. I wished them luck in their search, and said I really liked the team and hiring manager, nose as brown as can be, yada yada.

reddit_790,"White male Tech CEO calls for fewer white men in Tech I'm guessing Mr. Isaac Schleuter isn't going to demand that his own position be replaced by a non-white male. There's an interesting argument, typically made by people on the far right, that white males are now being discriminated against in Western society. A few years ago I would laughed at such a notion, but recently a friend of mine was turned down for a teaching position at the University of Victoria (Canada) and the administrator flat out told him they were looking for more ""diversity."" He now teaches English in Saudi Arabia. Also in Canada, I used to vote for the NDP. Now ""the party has a policy requiring any departing MLA to be replaced by a woman or 'equity-seeking candidate,' including racial minorities, Indigenous people, and members of the LGBTQ community."" One poor sap had to claim he was [bisexual]( to prevent losing his job. This is not ""justice"", social or otherwise. This is just discrimination under a new name. In the UK, poor white males are now recognized as the most [disadvantaged]( group. Why wouldn't they be? If you help every poor ethnic group except poor white people of course they'll become the most disadvantaged. And despite feminist claims, men almost always occupy the very bottom rungs of society. The left has lost its way. Whereas they used to focus on class and overcoming racial and sexual distinctions, they now seek to create maximum conflict between the sexes and races while the billionaires run laughing to the bank.

reddit_859,"[Inner city] [US History/8th grade] - Black vs African-American? I'm white. For the past four years, I've been teaching 8th grade in a school where 90% of the students are black.

In reality, I just mix it up based on what sounds better in the given sentence. I probably say ""black"" more because African-American is hard to say with a lot of syllables. But I have some sensitive students that take themselves pretty seriously, so I'm trying to avoid angry parent phone calls this year. This is my first time teaching U.S. history so race is going to come up a lot. I want to explain from the start what I just said here, but I really have no right to tell them ""You shouldn't be offended by black!"" or ""Most of you aren't even from Africa, so I'm not using African-American!""

I lost my temper and called him back and said, “ don’t worry about the job man, if you can’t understand someone getting the flu I don’t want to work for you anyway and hung up.” Does this look bad on me?

She claims to have killed in self defense, however, the facts don't match up to this. Take a look at [the case]( > Based on the position in which Allen's body was discovered, investigators believed that Allen may have been asleep when he was shot. Forensics noted that, postmortem, Allen was laying with his hands underneath his head >According to court documents, Brown threatened a jail nurse prior to her trial, stating ""I shot that man in the back of the head one time, bitch, I’m gonna shoot you in the back of the head three times. I’d love to hear your blood splatter on the wall.” A recording of a phone call she made to her adopted mother while in jail was also presented as further evidence against Brown, in the conversation she stated of the victim ""I executed him"". Further still, a fellow inmate testified that Brown had confessed to killing Allen ""just to see how it felt to kill somebody."" The activists fighting for her release know this (at least the main organizers, the celebrity endorsers probably don), and ywet they campaigned anyway. This is female privilege. A man who murdered a woman would never be released early, and there would never be campaigns for him.

reddit_962,"Is there software that can make accurate measurements/drawings of objects in 2D from a regular picture? So I work in sealing solutions, and one of the main problems we encounter are reverse engineering gaskets. I don't mean copy-catting or some such nonsense- I mean a customer needs a gasket replacement from a flange that might be 20 years old. There is no drawing, no pictures, no reference- just the gasket itself as a sample. We then have to take the sample and reverse engineer it. This takes a considerable amount of time. The main problem is that simply taking a picture and then scaling it in AutoCAD doesn't work very well- even if you scale the image to a set of points, while they may be accurate (for our needs, +/- 10-15 thousandths, less if possible), they often are only accurate at your reference point- so by the time you're 12 inches away, you're an entire .250"" or more off. We can iterate and work with this, and we do. Thing is, I just have to believe there is some software out there that will either- A) give us dimensions/geometry for complex shapes B)give us a file/dxf that can be imported right into AutoCAD C) something else that could be helpful that I'm not thinking of This would save several man hours per large, complicated gasket- and maybe most crucialy- prevent us from actually needing the sample to be shipped or driven all the way to our location.

reddit_1025,"People who look down on teachers I did a Master of Arts in Teaching several years ago but decided not to pursue the profession after realizing I wasn't really cut out for it. But something that surprised me was a certain amount of disdain for the profession in some quarters, including my family. I did the degree after a five year enlistment in the Army. In my mind I was upgrading from a working class job (enlisted soldier) to a middle class job. Turns out my father did not see it at all the same way. He and my stepmother intimated that they thought I would fall in love with graduate school and switch to a PhD in history. And I'm pretty sure he told people I was in grad school for history (I took a couple of undergrad history courses as part of the M.A.T. Social Studies degree). My dad is not a jerk in general, but I realized that he has been upper middle class his whole life. In his social set, many men married women who were teachers, but becoming a public school teacher was really unacceptable for a man. Another time I met an acquaintance of my father's, a retired lawyer. I mentioned I was going back to school and he said, ""oh, for business or law?"" I said, ""Education."" His face dropped. The next time I saw him he treated me with a subtle disdain. So it seems upper middle class people really tend to look down on teachers, but I suspect plenty of others who make average-ish salaries (no more than some veteran teachers) do as well.

reddit_1060,Figure Drawing So as an artist I enjoy going to figure drawing sessions where I get to drawn the human figure from a live model. I've been good to these type of sessions since I was sixteen. It usually for adults but they allow mature high school juniors and seniors as along as you're at least sixteen or older. Anyway I still go as adult and I'll usually go when I'm off from work and have the money and time. Sessions are about 8-10 dollars and you bring your own supplies and you can draw or paint from the figure for about three hours. Lately the sessions I've been going to have been having a lot of black female models. THANK GOD. My drawings have been more lively and vivid. For the longest time a lot of the models have been stick figure skinny white women and it annoys me. I don't mind sometimes but switch it up a little. More black female models or other women of color. Or hell some male models would be nice too those are also rare. And I mean young male models because anytime there is a man model he is usually old. I actually packed up and left early from a session because I just wasn't feeling the model and my drawings sucked. Granted not every day is a good drawing day but I fell like that's what it was. I'm at a point now where I'm just going to wait and see who the model is before I set up. If I'm not feeling the model I'm leaving and that's no disrespect to the model personally I'm just tired of drawing the same type of white woman.

So, when I found a job 4 minutes from my house, at another medical group, basically organizing their new clinic, I applied. A recruiter that works for the medical group, called me and was very excited that I am ""just what they are looking for"". I interviewed with the head of the office, who loved me. Great interview. The next week, I interviewed with both doctors that run the clinic. The male doctor did most of the interviewing and seemed to really like me and my experience. The woman doctor basically just sat there, no input or feedback and was very hard to read. The next day, this was last Friday, I texted the recruiter. She had told me to keep her number and text her with updates on how it went. She sent me back a text saying she was in a meeting but would touch base with the clinic to see what was going on. Didn't hear back on Monday. So on on Tuesday, I texted her again asking if she could tell me how long it might be before I heard anything.

After age three they naturally start to open up and/or break apart because their job is done. Adult and teen hymens aren't solid barriers; you can't ""break"" them. Hymens can easily stretch around objects (such as penises) without sustaining any damage. Many women still have an ""intact"" hymen after they have had sex, even if it's been multiple times. In a study of pregnant teens, only 2 out of 36 girls showed clear signs of penetration. Hymens can be damaged as a result of other non-sex activities, including exercise. Hymens don't bleed much when damaged, as they have few blood vessels in them. * The majority of women do not experience pain or bleeding the first time they have sex, and if they do it may not be related to the hymen at all. Bleeding is a common result of sex that is too rough or not lubricated enough, which is extremely common in couples who are inexperienced. Variations in an individual woman's anatomy can also lead to bleeding even with otherwise well-lubricated and gentle sex. That's my public service announcement. I hope you and your hymen have a happy day.

reddit_1182,"How to navigate office politics w/ regards to being an “ally”? Throwaway here for obvious reasons — most of my coworkers use Reddit. I’m 27 and a female engineer in a male dominated org. I’ve been working 4 years out of undergrad, so not really a whole lot of years in the industry. My director is a woman but I don’t know how much perceived legitimacy she actually has. Everyone likes her because she’s friendly and nice but everyone also knows she has zero say in the technical decisions, and is more the “people side of things” than anything technical. She leads the “women in engineering” group for our org. The problem I’m running into is that she expects me to be a more active proponent of her diversity efforts. I’m one of the more senior women in the org (the rest are mostly entry level) and she wants me to be more visible and active about being a woman and helping other women and posting in the org diversity groups and overall be more of an advocate for women. However, if I’m being completely honest, the main reason i don’t want to do this is because: 1) this takes time and focus away from me doing actual technical work that would get me promoted, 2) I get the overwhelming sense that people who mention diversity get taken a lot less seriously in the workplace afterwards (at the very least, technically). And so I’m not sure what to do from this position. I don’t believe I am obligated to do what she wants me to do just because I’m a woman too, but on the other hand she sits in on my promotion reviews and I think it really does bother her that I am not as active as she thinks I should be.

reddit_1237,The Whole Education System is BROKEN! Honestly😒 Okay since this whole admissions debacle has been exposed and the story about the black woman who was sent to jail. Just for trying to send her kids to a better school district has been bought up in comparison to this story. Has really hit home for me my parents did the same thing for me and my siblings the school I attended was in a predominately white neighborhood and the faculty at the school was mostly white people. I just connect with this story because us being black kids in that school gave me a different experience and some of the teachers knew we didn’t live in the zip code to attend that school. But only one teacher tried to get us kicked out because of that. And she would ask me in front of other students where I lived. Or just try to bring it up when I was getting in trouble or something mind you this was elementary school. Im a kid I didn’t know any better I would either just be quite or ask my sisters about it after school. But Im saying all that to say its just eye-opening for me to witness this B.S and to know my family had to do the same thing just to get us a quality education. And this scam is now being broadcasted when it has been going on for YEARS. I just felt the need to share this and want anyone who has thoughts or similar experiences to share.

But I think there are important lessons to be learned and important signals to recognize. I worked as a civil rights litigation/criminal law paralegal for 10 years before I made the outstanding move of going to law school. I know firsthand how completely overwhelming practicing law can be. You (sometimes literally) have a person's life in your hands. There is a huge workload and bigger expectations. Perfection is expected and often thrust on you. Deadlines constantly (CONSTANTLY) loom and there are times that you feel perennially under the gun. Attorney suicide (and law school student suicide) are very real issues. I've been working 20 hours a week through my first year because of my unique financial status, and there are times where it feels like I am barely keeping myself afloat psychologically. It's a good reminder that when you are freaking out, feeling overwhelmed, and underwater that maybe you need to take a moment for yourself. Unplug, even if just for a few hours. I know this is difficult advice for those studying for the bar. But lawyer suicides are increasing, and its surprisingly easy to find yourself in a dark place.

reddit_1291,Figure Drawing So as an artist I enjoy going to figure drawing sessions where I get to drawn the human figure from a live model. I've been good to these type of sessions since I was sixteen. It usually for adults but they allow mature high school juniors and seniors as along as you're at least sixteen or older. Anyway I still go as adult and I'll usually go when I'm off from work and have the money and time. Sessions are about 8-10 dollars and you bring your own supplies and you can draw or paint from the figure for about three hours. Lately the sessions I've been going to have been having a lot of black female models. THANK GOD. My drawings have been more lively and vivid. For the longest time a lot of the models have been stick figure skinny white women and it annoys me. I don't mind sometimes but switch it up a little. More black female models or other women of color. Or hell some male models would be nice too those are also rare. And I mean young male models because anytime there is a man model he is usually old. I actually packed up and left early from a session because I just wasn't feeling the model and my drawings sucked. Granted not every day is a good drawing day but I fell like that's what it was. I'm at a point now where I'm just going to wait and see who the model is before I set up. If I'm not feeling the model I'm leaving and that's no disrespect to the model personally I'm just tired of drawing the same type of white woman. It made me think of what Toni Morrison said when she was asked once about how come she only writes about black people and when was she going to write about white people. Like damn.

reddit_1293,"Confusion About Identity Hello all! So, I grew up with baby boomer parents and all throughout my childhood they vilified what became known as black culture. Like, what became known as ebonics/aave was completely demonized in my household. Rap and hip hop were completely demonized as well as all the fashion and dancing that came out of it. And note, this wasn't just gangster rap, it was like all of it. R&B for the most part, was lumped in with stuff like gangster rap, save a few artists like Boyz2Men, Mariah Carey, and some others. I did grow up listening to black music from the 80s and before; as well as Jazz artists. But, being a 24 year old black woman I find it hard to relate to anyone that participates in black culture and I always feel really strange when someone assumes I know something about it (I'm black, so why wouldn't they?) and I can't respond with anything. I honestly am really confused about who I am concerning culture. On one hand, I really want to get into black culture because it feels like a large part of my identity that I have looked down upon for so long due to my parents. But on the other hand, I have no idea where to begin and I don't want to mix culture with stereotyping. And honestly, it's not just music; it's everything. Like, even in college when I tried to join black organizations there was this huge feeling of I don't belong here because it seemed like everyone had similar mannerisms and experiences, but me. I'm just so confused. Anyone else been in this situation or have any advice? P.S: And to note, my parents are black. They just grew up in the 50s before modern black culture was a thing. So when it started taking hold, they saw it as something to be avoided. When I've asked them about my confusion with culture, this is what they told me. They always said, ""You're an American, you're not black. Other people will see you as that and ascribe things to you, but you're American.

reddit_1346,"Rant. Losing my mind over printing/copies. My school doesn't allow us to make copies. None. We share a printer for the whole team and we were told that once the toner runs out, they will not be replacing it. The principal just tells us not to teach using copied things. Have the students write their work instead.. but let's be realistic. It's not always possible. Sometimes you need to print or copy activities and various other things. So I've had to print my things at home. I have a cheaper little printer that is a piece of garbage and since school started on August 14th, I have replaced my black and color ink cartridges twice. I just ran out again tonight. I get maybe 40 pages to a cartridge if I'm lucky. I'm at the point where I want to cry over a darn printer issue because I can't afford to keep replacing these cartridges for $35 a piece every two weeks. I just can't do it. So what do I do? Bore the hell out of my kids by never giving them any cut and paste activities, or any sort of things to paste into their journals, or sorting, or any centers puzzles (because I'd have to print them myself!)? They're below grade level 1st graders. They can barely write and the principal wants them to literally copy everything down in a notebook instead of me giving them templates?! I've only been in school a month and I am already at my wit's end. I literally can't afford this. My husband says to look into a laserjet printer so we can get more mileage out of a toner instead.. but to buy the printer itself is expensive and the toners are about $100 a pop. How can a school lack money that badly to where we aren't allowed to print or copy things AT ALL? It's insane. I should have asked about their budget when I interviewed. Maybe I could have avoided this, because the school I student taught at last spring let the teachers copy whatever they wanted and they're just right down the street from this one.

reddit_1347,"What are your thoughts on why there aren’t many African American teachers. Black teachers only make up 7 % of public school educators across the nation. Black males is even lower. Each year more and more black teachers are leaving the profession due to reasons ranging from feeling “pigeonholed” into only serving black students, being pressured into being the unofficial disciplinarian of students of color, to feeling ostracized by their administration and colleagues. These are ALL things I faced as an African American teacher my first couple years of teaching and had I remained at the school where I was, I would have most likely left the profession as well, but like most teachers, the students kept me motivated to keep going. My last year there our school had a “ Black History Month” Assembly which ONLY focused on the achievement African-Americans have made in sports and music. When I spoke to my principal about it she told me she didn’t feel offended and that neither should I. SHE as a white woman was not offended so ME as a black man shouldn’t.

It was people who had known me for a long time, like good friends, school principals, and classmates, and it was often a common occurrence, it never happened just once.

reddit_1356,"In regards to the boy committing suicide due to being bullied, and no one stopping him, it reminded me of something else. On Netflix there is a new show called Mr.Iglesias, Staring Gabriel “Fluffy” Iglesias, the show is a bout him being a teacher at a school in Southern California. Now while the show overall I’d say is pretty good in episode 5, one of the student characters, Lorenzo, is believed to be being bullied, Gabriel, and a few other teachers, go to try and intervene when they find out that the bully in question is a girl named Rita Perez. At first they are confused as to what to do in this situation, but they do the right thing and report her to the principal, Paula, both Paula and Lorenzo are black, this becomes important later. When they first say Lorenzo is being bullied Paula starts saying how “bows with too much testosterone are a pain” and asks who the bully is, when Paula finds out that the bully in question was a girl she opts into doing absolutely nothing, that is until Gabriel mentions Rita saying the word, negrito, which, according to the show, means little blacky, she then decided to suspend Rita but not be cause Lorenzo as a man was being bullied, but because she said a single word that ticked Paula off. Lather it turns out that Rita, and Lorenzo like each other, which somehow makes all of the bullying okay. Lorenzo explains everything before Rita gets suspended and they go about their lives. This episode ticked me off, however I didn’t really know how to put it into words why. Now, after seeing the story of the boy committing suicide, I understand this ticks me off because the show shares the message that bullying/abusing your male partner as a sign of affection is okay.

The hospital I worked at is a smaller one, terribly understaffed and my last manager was a nightmare. Last fall/winter the stress finally caught up and I began having panic attacks and severe anxiety to the point I couldn’t leave my house, with intrusive thoughts basically picturing myself in the place of previous codes I’d been to and subsequently living with a constant fear I was about to die. Long story short with meds and therapy I’ve improved, quit my surgical job and took a job in a long term care/geriatric rehab facility which is much less stressful and easier on my mental health. I’ve basically taken the attitude that I’m cutting back my hours and work load for as long as I need to allow myself to recover psychologically. Clearly these occurrences led to a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder with “elements of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder”. I’m not sure why I found it so shocking to hear a doctor tell me it looks like I have a case of PTSD directly related to my line of work, and almost struggle to believe it since I’ve not experienced a traumatic event directly myself, only observed traumatic things happen to patients.

reddit_1385,"How bad is it to wear flats in an interview? Unfortunately, I may have to start interviewing again (sadly, in my field jobs tend to be project-based, so I change every 6-12 months. IT SUCKS). I'm a 40/F, project manager in tech. I don't live in a particularly conservative city, dress-wise. I don't wear heels. It's not out of disrespect for professional norms, and I realize I'm short. The issue is I have spinal damage from being hit by a truck. Walking in flats is painful, and when I've tried to push for physical therapy and/or a small procedure that would fix the damage done to my tailbone/pelvis, I get finger-wagged that I should be wearing sneakers at all times. I have a faint-to-pronounced limp depending on weather, previous day's activities, etc. It's not just comfort and safety. While I know most of the questions come from a place of caring/concern, ""What happened, why are you limping?"" gets old quick. I'm tired of reliving the accident, even in one sentence, and I'm frankly tired of intrusive questions and judgments. If I wear flats, I may be able to pass as able-bodied, which is a plus in frankly not a very inclusive industry.

A couple days ago, someone posted a link to a thread in which a Redditor [described her hatred for black customers at her fast food establishment]( Not only was the post itself vile, but it created a place for thousands of bandwagoning racists to comment about their hate for black people. However, like most racists, this one wasn't very smart. She had left comments in her previous posts that contained identifiable information, and some of our more sleuthy users were able to identify the individual. The manager of her work got several emails and phone calls about her post. According to one of our Reddiors I spoke to, the manager said she'd never heard of Reddit, but was very disturbed by the employee's comments posted there. The managers also informed them that their restaurant doesn’t tolerate that type of behaviour or attitude towards their customers and, as of today, that employee was no longer with the restaurant. The truth of the matter is, in our current era, racist are more bold than ever. They need to be taught their racism will _not_ be tolerated.

reddit_1423,"Black mothers are dying in childbirth 3-4x more than white mothers in the U.S. Hey all! I’m a producer for Empowered Health, a new podcast that is aiming to demystify women’s health. We just put out the first episode of our two-part series on the maternal mortality crisis. Episode one explores how race plays a role in this crisis– it becomes clear our culture isn't doing enough to protect black mothers. Black women are three to four times more likely than non-Hispanic white women to die during childbirth. That’s even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, like education and income. As more than one researcher said to us, the birthing crisis is the canary in the coal mine of women's health. It is a problem of women not being listened to, not being respected and being disempowered during a time in life when they should feel entitled to good care and a personal feeling of empowerment, feeling full of feminine power and purpose. Dr. Neel Shah, the director of the Delivery Decisions Initiative at Ariadne Labs, breaks down how medical students are trained to be biased and how that contributes to this problem. Fatima Dainkeh of YWCABoston helps us understand actually talking to black mothers is a good place to start and that a day-long workshop on bias isn't going to cut it. Midwife Ebony Marcelle shares how she's shaped her care model to better serve African American mothers. And, Dr. Mary-Ann Etiebet, the executive director of Merck for Mothers, looks at the global initiative she heads working to integrating the voices of black women into maternal mortality and morbidity.

Skirts / dresses cannot be shorter than one inch above knees. Blazers are optional but strictly recommended. Some observations 1. Most Men are in full suits 2. Most women are also in full suits. Teenage women are easily able to abide by dress codes, it is working women who somehow cannot and make stupid excuses on why they should be able to dress how they like, even if men wear suits. 3.

For instance, Facebook or Amazon would be great examples because both have unfavorable CEOs and have issues with data privacy or unfair workplace conditions. But... at the same time, I know my friends working at these companies or people I will be working with obviously don't agree with the CEO/board's opinions and decisions. On one hand, yes, by working for this company, you are indirectly supporting these malpractices because you are helping the company grow and succeed, and thus continuing their bad behavior... but is it really so black & white?

I've been interviewing for a lot of forward facing jobs and get the impression that how I look is causing me to be immediately rejected. The phone interview will go well, but when I meet the interviewers in person they have a very strange demeanor. You know when you go on a date with someone that clearly isn't interested? That's the exact feeling I get from the very start of most interviews, like they don't want to be there but have to at least go through the motions. I just finished an interview where the hiring manager didn't ask me a single question about myself, no follow up questions, and just seemed irritated that she had to be there. I can usually recognize when I'm just not a good fit for a job, but it seems like I've been encountering a lot of odd behavior lately.

I’m a private duty LPN for a local pediatric hospital. I’ve been a nurse for years now so it’s nothing new. Onward, I’ve been coming to a home for awhile now, the child has hx of seizures and muscle rigidity. They’re given Ativan concentrate routinely, this is the primary method of seizure control. There is “known” diversion going on. It’s suspected mom dilutes (you read that right) her Ativan and leaves diluted ass medication for her disabled kid. Humanity. Several of us have notified our respective supervisors, we were given the BS advice to “document your findings” but not say that directly. I was asked to write a statement, in which I declined bc I’ve been burned in situations like these before. The medication is dispensed 10-12 bottles at a time. Cyclically the child will start having a shit ton of seizures, and the medication will have a watery consistency. There are other “backup” meds to be given PRN but they’re not as effective. Today I noticed the same watery bottle, so I looked at the three remaining bottles and the tamper seal is white, indicating they’ve been opened. They also were watery, not like the usual viscous Ativan. My questions: I’m stumped bc giving a known altered drug seems like a huge liability. The kid is a few clusters from a grand mal that would do some damage. We’ve already told management who is apathetic and loose lipped, so any reports goes to this one senior RN who’s very tight with the mom.

reddit_1545,HELP WANTED - Art Project Hey everyone! While I was in graduate school I began an art project that I never completed. But according to some visiting artists and the faculty it had a lot promise. I took minimum wage worker uniforms and talked to a worker about their experiences as a Latinx hourly-wage worker. It started with mine: I had a stop and shop uniform I used to wear and recognized that I would always speak English with other Hispanics in front of white customers. I wrote that story on the uniform with a marker and hung it up. I also collected a shirt from a guy from Trader Joe’s and a CNA from a nursing home. One of the things I was trying to accomplish with the art project was just collecting the experiences of minorities working hourly-wage jobs and combatting any assumption upper management or white Americans make about us: “s/he’s uneducated.” “they’re stealing jobs.” Etc...

reddit_1571,"Black mothers are dying in childbirth 3-4x more than white mothers in the U.S. Hey all! I’m a producer for Empowered Health, a new podcast that is aiming to demystify women’s health. We just put out the first episode of our two-part series on the maternal mortality crisis. Episode one explores how race plays a role in this crisis– it becomes clear our culture isn't doing enough to protect black mothers. Black women are three to four times more likely than non-Hispanic white women to die during childbirth. That’s even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, like education and income. As more than one researcher said to us, the birthing crisis is the canary in the coal mine of women's health. It is a problem of women not being listened to, not being respected and being disempowered during a time in life when they should feel entitled to good care and a personal feeling of empowerment, feeling full of feminine power and purpose. Dr. Neel Shah, the director of the Delivery Decisions Initiative at Ariadne Labs, breaks down how medical students are trained to be biased and how that contributes to this problem. Fatima Dainkeh of YWCABoston helps us understand actually talking to black mothers is a good place to start and that a day-long workshop on bias isn't going to cut it. Midwife Ebony Marcelle shares how she's shaped her care model to better serve African American mothers. And, Dr. Mary-Ann Etiebet, the executive director of Merck for Mothers, looks at the global initiative she heads working to integrating the voices of black women into maternal mortality and morbidity.

The Asian sat at the 3rd row ahead and on Friday, she came all the way to my desk and asked if I was Chinese (I'm Korean btw), saying that 'I am new here too', 'did you grow up here?' blah blah and saying how she was happy to see another 'Asian' in the office (I felt that was weird) can you imagine another race, like a black employee for example, going up to another new face employee who is also black and saying, ""it's good to see another black brothe here in the office?"" it's just weird and not right.

On the one hand I don't like living in China on the other hand the money is good and I like living in Asia (currently have an Taiwanese girlfriend who's working in my city and have always been more attracted to Asian women). However I never really planned on a teaching career. I originally came to Asia to spend a year after college but liked it and stayed. But now I am also considering going back to the States.

If you can survive the first few year, then you can have a cushy job ( if you are willing to follow where the work is ). I realized that this was not the career for me and decided to do a part time boot camp for Full Stack Development under the advice of a close friend and rediscover my passion for problem solving and having the ability to build elaborate solutions to exciting problems. However, I was unsuccessful in the job hunting process and I am depressed as hell at my current job, but it was difficult for me to just quit a job because my parents are Asian, so I'd to decided to do a post-bacc at my Local Public University to further bolster my skill set and go back to the drawing board. I am not currently aiming for a master's instead because I realized those programs are very accelerated/crash courses and the better one asks that you have at least taken some CS courses and I feel a bachelor would be a good way to get my feet wet.

So I got my assignment for 6th grade, which is outside of my preferred 4th/5th but still in the uppers. My area is mostly Latino with a high percentage of ELL students. Are there any tips on how to start off the year right? Some things I’ve gathered and done this far: 1. I emailed both my principal and vice principal introducing myself. 2. Asked about which curriculum they’ve adopted for math and ELA. Thankfully I’m familiar with one of them. Though I’m not sure if this school has teachers teach only one subject and the students rotate, prepping them for middle school. 3. Looking to setting up a Donor’s Choose/ Go Fund Me for school supplies and classroom library. The things I’m really worried about are the first day/week, behavior management for 6th grade (my co-teacher when I was student teaching just yelled at them all the time, not a tactic I want to use), as well as teaching ELA/ELD (math and science were always my strong suit), and finally money to set up my classroom.",reddit,post_metoo,2019,race_authority,['man'],['latino'],['teacher'],['principal'],NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL,POSITIVE,0.7430738806724548,0.9955307841300964,0.5608697533607483,0.14249206349206348

It started with mine: I had a stop and shop uniform I used to wear and recognized that I would always speak English with other Hispanics in front of white customers. I wrote that story on the uniform with a marker and hung it up. I also collected a shirt from a guy from Trader Joe’s and a CNA from a nursing home.

reddit_1670,"Black mothers are dying in childbirth 3-4x more than white mothers in the U.S. Hey all! I’m a producer for Empowered Health, a new podcast that is aiming to demystify women’s health. We just put out the first episode of our two-part series on the maternal mortality crisis. Episode one explores how race plays a role in this crisis– it becomes clear our culture isn't doing enough to protect black mothers. Black women are three to four times more likely than non-Hispanic white women to die during childbirth. That’s even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, like education and income. As more than one researcher said to us, the birthing crisis is the canary in the coal mine of women's health. It is a problem of women not being listened to, not being respected and being disempowered during a time in life when they should feel entitled to good care and a personal feeling of empowerment, feeling full of feminine power and purpose. Dr. Neel Shah, the director of the Delivery Decisions Initiative at Ariadne Labs, breaks down how medical students are trained to be biased and how that contributes to this problem. Fatima Dainkeh of YWCABoston helps us understand actually talking to black mothers is a good place to start and that a day-long workshop on bias isn't going to cut it. Midwife Ebony Marcelle shares how she's shaped her care model to better serve African American mothers. And, Dr. Mary-Ann Etiebet, the executive director of Merck for Mothers, looks at the global initiative she heads working to integrating the voices of black women into maternal mortality and morbidity.

Salary was under 60k. Got job at e-commerce company handling logistics software. Salary is around 70k. I work primarily with React and C#/Entity. Been here for almost 6 months. PNW but not Seattle. I learned they wanted to hire a developer to work at their warehouse in the midwest. I really want to work in the midwest and since I already know the processes, the company wouldn't have to train someone remotely which would be a huge pain so I offered to relocate. Also, it's easier to find a competent developer in the PNW than where their warehouse is. The managers agree, but CTO said no unless I took a massive paycut since cost of living is lower over there. It's only lower by 10% and I'd go from no state income tax to over 5%. I said no, and basically the CTO is saying that they are going to try to find someone for cheap before thinking of relocating me. This makes me think that yearly raises are barely going to be a thing and I'm already not a fan of how expensive some of the benefits are.

I'm certain that we have all seen that in the bill that was passed in Alabama that miscarriages are criminalized as well as abortions.

I'm concerned because if women can be made felons for the tragedy of having a miscarriage then those women would effectively lose the right to vote. We saw in 2013 that the Supreme court did away with key components to the Voting Rights Act that protected citizens from racial discrimination. In many states where felons are able to vote only after completing their parole/probation, community service, paying fines. Failure to pay these fines can add interest to the original fine. Felons already have a difficult time attaining employment, and maintaining that employment is part of their parole. That interest can increase by over 100%, making those in parole unable to ever finish their sentence and attain the right to vote again.

reddit_1739,"Black mothers are dying in childbirth 3-4x more than white mothers in the U.S. Hey all! I’m a producer for Empowered Health, a new podcast that is aiming to demystify women’s health. We just put out the first episode of our two-part series on the maternal mortality crisis. Episode one explores how race plays a role in this crisis– it becomes clear our culture isn't doing enough to protect black mothers. Black women are three to four times more likely than non-Hispanic white women to die during childbirth. That’s even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, like education and income. As more than one researcher said to us, the birthing crisis is the canary in the coal mine of women's health. It is a problem of women not being listened to, not being respected and being disempowered during a time in life when they should feel entitled to good care and a personal feeling of empowerment, feeling full of feminine power and purpose. Dr. Neel Shah, the director of the Delivery Decisions Initiative at Ariadne Labs, breaks down how medical students are trained to be biased and how that contributes to this problem. Fatima Dainkeh of YWCABoston helps us understand actually talking to black mothers is a good place to start and that a day-long workshop on bias isn't going to cut it.

I have been working abroad for a while now, and for the two last years - as a consultant for two different international organizations. Prior to this I worked several years as a sales account manager for a large tech company. As I am planning to eventually move back to my home country with my family - I want to prepare as good as I can for job opportunities in the consulting sector. I am currently working in South Korea, but I am however from a smaller north European country originally. My question is more related to what skill set I should look to develop in order to have a good chance of landing a job within one of the major firms. My current consultant experience has mainly been on databases and software project management. As I see it, my main problem is that I don't really have a academic background in this field (MSc in finance). The other problem I forsee is that I have mainly been working with management of these different projects, not the coding of the solutions - but rather the integration and migration parts. I also plan to take on a MBA at some point, when I have the necessary experience.

Over the last twenty years, I've seen my Asian peers become quite successful but something always seemed to be missing. Whether they were just following their parents dream, or just didn't like what they did, there was something that wasn't fulfilling about our lives. I know I went through that as I worked for company after company that had successful exits, only to find myself temporarily excited and then it would be back to the grind. I looked for a lot of resources that would talk about taboo topics in the Asian community but couldn't find too many. Because of this, we (Brandon Chien, sex coach) started a podcast called the Happy Asian Males where we discuss various topics including mental health, human optimization, vulnerability, and even dive into topics like psychedelics and what they can do for Asians. I'd love to hear your feedback on what we are doing and hopefully you find it a positive contribution to the Asian community.

Each year more and more black teachers are leaving the profession due to reasons ranging from feeling “pigeonholed” into only serving black students, being pressured into being the unofficial disciplinarian of students of color, to feeling ostracized by their administration and colleagues. These are ALL things I faced as an African American teacher my first couple years of teaching and had I remained at the school where I was, I would have most likely left the profession as well, but like most teachers, the students kept me motivated to keep going. My last year there our school had a “ Black History Month” Assembly which ONLY focused on the achievement African-Americans have made in sports and music. When I spoke to my principal about it she told me she didn’t feel offended and that neither should I. SHE as a white woman was not offended so ME as a black man shouldn’t.

I know this subreddit skews very American but I’ll take any advice I can get. My department organises the December rota by saying you can either work Christmas OR New Year. You can request what you want to work, but if too many people request Christmas off (or vice versa), you will work the opposite of what you worked last year. In 2018, I worked Christmas Day itself and 26/27 December night shifts (the 26th December is a public holiday in the UK). I was off for New Year, returning to work on the 2nd January. Sucks, but hey, at least, I’ll get Christmas Day with my family next year right? Today, I find out that I have Christmas Day off. I’m on a 12 hour day 26th December, then nights. Working a 12 hour day shift on New Year’s Day, nights 2nd and 3rd. My family are a seven hour drive away, rendering my Christmas Day off pointless. I appreciate that this is no one else’s problem (I wasn’t forced to move here) but I was fully expecting Boxing Day off having worked it last year, and requesting Christmas off when the sign up sheet went up. We have a very active department groupchat for shift swaps, but so far no one wants to take my 26th day shift, and I don’t expect people to bite my hand off for it. It is a public holiday here. My plan of action for tomorrow at work is to to find out if there is any kind of written policy that states either Christmas or New Year, and I will speak to my line manager as we are both on shift together, but I am fully expecting a ‘too bad, so sad’ response.

He offered effusive praise such as “everybody loves you” and told me that the job was basically in the bag. He even went as far as to tell me that they were not interviewing other candidates. I was thrilled! The only catch? I had to complete a hiring assignment. OK, no problem. I’ve accepted these in the past but usually they are only 1 to 2 hours at most.

I would like some opinions from anyone who have worked at either of these companies or have any information on them. I was offered a fullstack role from Amex, which I feel is a great skill, especially when changing careers, since a lot of companies are attracted to hire fullstack engineers, and perhaps it leads to a more clear path to one day move into management or a lead position. Also, American Express was very open about me changing teams if I ever wanted. I'm not sure how easy that actually is. On the other hand, VISA offered me slightly more money, but in Foster City CA. That is by the San Francisco Bay Area and apparently a very very expensive place to live. Once cost of living is factored in, both offers are financially similar. I've read a lot about the Bay Area and Foster City recently, and people seem to not like it.

The work/team/business have all been fine, and I negotiated to work less hours (which is an important benefit to me). The first ~10 devs were more experienced than I am, but most of them have since left and were recently replaced with more junior people. All of the remaining devs except me were just promoted into hybrid management-engineer roles. I have a performance review coming soon, but will continue as an IC—the company needs productive hackers, and the available management slots have been filled (NB: fine by me). So I'm trying to figure out what's next. I haven't been growing technically: we don't use any tech I haven't used a lot beforehand, and I don't want to come up with contrived projects just to learn, say, a new frontend framework. I've already put a lot of effort into understanding the business side of things, and have spent a year efficiently turning poorly-specced stories into working code (frequently collaborating with stakeholders in other departments).

On the other side, though, it's not always so easy to find a startup with strong engineering practices and sensible business decisions (especially outside of the Bay Area), and I also really appreciate the schedule flexibility I have.

reddit_1888,HELP WANTED - Art Project Hey everyone! While I was in graduate school I began an art project that I never completed. But according to some visiting artists and the faculty it had a lot promise. I took minimum wage worker uniforms and talked to a worker about their experiences as a Latinx hourly-wage worker. It started with mine: I had a stop and shop uniform I used to wear and recognized that I would always speak English with other Hispanics in front of white customers. I wrote that story on the uniform with a marker and hung it up. I also collected a shirt from a guy from Trader Joe’s and a CNA from a nursing home. One of the things I was trying to accomplish with the art project was just collecting the experiences of minorities working hourly-wage jobs and combatting any assumption upper management or white Americans make about us: “s/he’s uneducated.” “they’re stealing jobs.” Etc...

reddit_1912,"Black mothers are dying in childbirth 3-4x more than white mothers in the U.S. Hey all! I’m a producer for Empowered Health, a new podcast that is aiming to demystify women’s health. We just put out the first episode of our two-part series on the maternal mortality crisis. Episode one explores how race plays a role in this crisis– it becomes clear our culture isn't doing enough to protect black mothers. Black women are three to four times more likely than non-Hispanic white women to die during childbirth. That’s even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, like education and income. As more than one researcher said to us, the birthing crisis is the canary in the coal mine of women's health. It is a problem of women not being listened to, not being respected and being disempowered during a time in life when they should feel entitled to good care and a personal feeling of empowerment, feeling full of feminine power and purpose. Dr. Neel Shah, the director of the Delivery Decisions Initiative at Ariadne Labs, breaks down how medical students are trained to be biased and how that contributes to this problem. Fatima Dainkeh of YWCABoston helps us understand actually talking to black mothers is a good place to start and that a day-long workshop on bias isn't going to cut it. Midwife Ebony Marcelle shares how she's shaped her care model to better serve African American mothers. And, Dr. Mary-Ann Etiebet, the executive director of Merck for Mothers, looks at the global initiative she heads working to integrating the voices of black women into maternal mortality and morbidity.

reddit_1930,"American Born Taiwanese but from my Mainland China friends, I get ""it's a shame your parents didn't teach you Mandarin"". Hello, Born and raised in US. My parents are from Taiwan. I grew up speaking Taiwanese never Mandarin. I guess it's because my parents feel more Taiwanese than Chinese. Taiwanese is how they spoke to each other and all my relatives. I grew up in New Jersey in a community where me and my family were the only Asians so my challenges growing up were mostly about being judged for being Asian by non Asians. But being in New York, more culturally and ethnically diverse community, I feel the judgement is coming from other Asians - specifically Mainland Chinese Asians.

With the rise of China as a power, sure learning Mandarin would have been an advantage business wise but the comment comes off more a judgement about how I was raised.. The little digs used to bother me a lot but now it just makes me angry because as friends we should be embracing each other's unique background and experiences rather than disparaging it. And who has control over how they were raised anyway. I think it is also such a China centric thing to say - that learning Taiwanese was waste of time. Because to Mainlanders, Taiwan is part of China so of course everyone should know Mandarin instead. They refuse to acknowledge that there are people in Taiwan that might actually think differently.

While living there, I started out teaching English and moved up to teaching business English to students preparing to attend US universities. I was finally able to land a business job and began working for a Chinese factory. Long story short, the factory grew exponentially and transitioned from a tech factory (mobile phone cases for brands like Incase, Belkin, etc) to a high end fashion leather goods factory (handbags, wallets, and leather accessories for brands like Kate Spade, Tory Burch, Michael Kors, Coach, etc). We had outstanding growth due to the relationships I built and were constantly picking up new brands as people left one brand, transitioned to a new company, and would reach out to continue working with me.

reddit_1943,"Stuck in the Training phase for eternity I work in Dubai for a Chinese company, right now I am being trained as a business to business sales management position. The company the job because I am a Westerner and can also speak Mandarin. Obviously this sounded like a great opportunity for some first time management experience, my enthusiasm to learn and get started was very high, until I started. Part of Chinese business culture is to not let outsiders know the methodology of your business until they can be trusted, this sounds reasonable enough until you put it into practice. I had this problem before when working in Beijing, but this new job has left me with absolutely nothing to do. There is no direct training at all, and my boss told me to observe the current Chinese manager. They barely let me do anything, just insist that I study, study, study. But I have learned everything (that they allow me to learn) and spend the majority of my day sitting doing nothing. It has been 3 weeks already of answering a phone here and there and then having to ask somebody else to quote the price (they won't let me quote prices even though it is a simple system based on volume of purchase). So I am pretty much rendered useless. It seems ridiculous to me, because the only way to truly learn is to do it yourself, even if that means being supervised. Right now, I am making 70% reduced salary which isn't too bad for doing literally nothing contributive. However, there is no set deadline for me to start working.

Last week our principal broke the news that our former colleague had suffered a stroke.

The good news is that her long term memory has not been affected and she has retained some mobility. She can also speak. A call went out for teachers at the elementary school and our junior-senior high school to cater meals for her family. I was sorry to hear that she was the sole supporter for a family of four. I volunteered to bring food in tomorrow for delivery by another colleague on Saturday. I prepared two plastic to-go containers of orange-mango chicken (pictured above) and two additional containers of beef with broccoli (pictured below). I also used a rice cooker to prepare 5 cups of steamed white rice . I THOUGHT about making a 5th container of Buddha's Delight which is Chinese vegan dish but decided that I might be going overboard. I hope this person will recover and be able to return to work. I will have to check and see if anyone has started a Go Fund Me campaign on her behalf to offset expenses.

Reason why I ask was because I recently started a new job at a marketing firm and there were several other new employees who started on the same day. One of them happened to be a young Asian female who looked around my age (mid 20's) and pretty much all of the employees in our office are white with a small mix of blacks. On my first and second day, I made the efforts of trying to introduce myself to those who sat around me (although my director already introduced me to some of them) excluding the entire section of people sat 2-3 rows ahead of where I sit. The Asian sat at the 3rd row ahead and on Friday, she came all the way to my desk and asked if I was Chinese (I'm Korean btw), saying that 'I am new here too', 'did you grow up here?' blah blah and saying how she was happy to see another 'Asian' in the office (I felt that was weird) can you imagine another race, like a black employee for example, going up to another new face employee who is also black and saying, ""it's good to see another black brothe here in the office?"" it's just weird and not right. I got an automatic assumption that this Asian female employee only feels comfortable around other Asians, she hardly interacts with the employees who sit around here since I can tell from a distance and was quite surprised how she came up all the way up to me out of nowhere and started to introduce herself with a bunch of questions like that.

Never had any write ups, never had any reprimands, nothing. Always on time, always the one to volunteer to work extra. I serve, bartend and hourly manage. Haven't called out a day in over 2 years and that was when I had the flu. When the gm wants to leave early, I am the one that picks up the slack so they can leave.

I told them to put away their phones, stop eating at the front, stop going to the back and flirting with the cooks and to do their job. Stuff I have been trying to get them to do all along but they haven't been. So I get called in the office yesterday and told I am suspended until further notice and under investigation because my name came up for saying discriminatory remarks towards certain races. I said that was ridiculous and asked what was supposedly said. The manager wouldn't tell me. Just said they will complete their investigation and let me know.

So you mix that with not proper staffing, and people don't feel like the work they put in is being rewarded. We don't feel compensated at all. So instead of my manager taking some kind of responsibility or even show sympathy... She proceeded to say, ""then if you all are so unhappy, why are you still working here? That's my biggest question."" I was appalled. I simply told her... People have families, bills, debt. It's not exactly easy to find a new job at a moments notice. People have to stay for very many different reasons. So completely ignoring that comment, she then proceeded to blow my mind yet again. And literally asked me to change my answers on the next survey.

I’m someone who has always been extremely intelligent and book smart, but less gifted in actually applying that to hands-on skills and that is starting to become painfully obvious. I guess it could be worse - I’ve never committed a medical error, sneaked narcotics or had a discrepancy, or had a patient die due to my negligence. I’ve been a nurse for about a year, the first 8 months or so of which were on a mixed medical ICU and PCU. I was mostly on the PCU side, but I juggled 3 patients (our max ratio, which was pretty much all the time) fairly easily and in general felt like I had the grasp of most of the job by 6-7 months in. I left because I hated management and the patient population.

It’s been 3 months and according to my managers, I’m not doing well and not where they want to be. They told me by 4 months they expected me to be handling cases mostly independently and all the other orientees, even those who started after me, are succeeding much more quickly.

I was given an ultimatum of looking after my infant daughter who had chicken pox for a few days or keeping my job. I know I could take the whole thing to tribunal but I have had enough with the company and decided to leave on my own terms. I had a bit of a mixed role. My title was estimator, but in reality I was running my own department estimating and coordinating stone masonry projects all over London. There was a lot more scheduling, meeting with clients, checking progress and reevaluation of projects going on for a typical estimating role. After looking into project management and what it entails I am fairly certain that is what I have been doing all along under a different title. My question is, without 'project manager' on my CV how would I go about getting into that? I am also hoping to step away from construction as although I am competent in it I have lost my interest in the sector. Which leads to my next hurdle.

Masters (MBA) from NYIT New York. i have a mixed work experience between the IT and Management. i started as Technical Support Engineer and then a Senior IT Technical Support Engineer, i switched to management after taking my online MBA in 2008 and i got involved in management (Operations Manager and Business Development) till 2015 when i came to the USA. so IT has been my passion since the beginning but Controls is the job i found and i have been doing it for the past couple of years but i do not see myself doing it any more. i have been applying aggressively for IT jobs even jobs for entry level, jobs like project management, business analyst, IT consultant and any other job that does not require technical work or technical customer support (Basically any job that i can use my management skills with the support of my previous technical skills in troubleshooting and supporting microsoft platform such as Windows Server, Exchange, ISA,...) with no luck. i thought that my resume is the issue so i decided to ask the help of a professional resume writing company and they reshaped my old resume and gave me a new one that can pass the ATS systems. i have been using the new resume since June and i did not receive any phone call. I'm wondering what is wrong. What do i have to do to get a job in the IT domain?

A little back story: At the beginning of the year I was let go from a mid-sized company in the battery/automotive industry. I did enjoy working at the company albeit the frustrations of my job. The company was very involved with a majority of the auto manufacturers here in the US and some overseas. Mainly I worked in a tech support/customer service hybrid role, but I did involve myself with other departments (software & hardware engineering, product testing and quality control) I saw a great future there and actively pursued an open role in product management for one of our lines. After what seemed like a minor disagreement with my immediate supervisor one day, I was fired at the end of the next day. I do have a bit of a colorful background, including commercial food service design, MEP design & drafting, land surveying & drafting and computers & networking. I also run a very small business on a property that I rent where I do race car fabrication, welding and general work. I attended a local community college taking classes in automotives, computers, networking, welding and other general studies. I do have an associates, but it absolutely is not anything useful (non-transferable) I actually obtained it on accident and by surprise, just showed up in the mail one day. Finding work with what I believe is a fair compensation has been extremely challenging.

In the ensuing 3.5 years, I’ve outgrown my position and am finishing up my degree so it’s time to get out and get started. School-wise, I nailed the intro stuff. I ended community college with a 4.0 GPA in Intro Accounting, Intro Managerial, Management and Statistics. It’s been more mixed but positive at my college now: C+ in macro economics, Intermediate I and II, A’s in Auditing, business law, micro economics and finance, B+ in Advanced Accounting and Cost Accounting. No repeats, thankfully.😅 I LOVED auditing and cost. They made the most sense and seemed to come naturally to me. I don’t have plans right at the moment to take the CPA exam, either. I have marketing and income tax as the last two classes starting in January and then I’m done. I’m just scared that I don’t know enough to legit go out and start interviewing for accounting jobs. I feel like I’m missing a lot of stuff and I will seem like a fraud once I get into an interview and they start asking questions. I know the basics but I get tongue-tied about revenue recognition and cash vs. accrual, which are also basics.

I just found out about a new opportunity for a young but successful company where I would be pretty hands-on with the tech, which is what I want. And, the pay’s better too. The new company is also doing something that’s good and socially responsible, whereas I’m at a agency now. That means a lot to me—for the last 14 years I’ve worked for companies doing some good in the world. Director level jobs like mine are few and far between in my city, and when you mix that with a tech stack I love, getting to be hands on, and working somewhere high-energy, it’s pretty compelling. The next closest two metro areas are a hour and a half (or more) commute, and with a young kid, I want to be close so I’m around more. So I can’t figure out what to do. How shitty would it be to leave so soon, especially when I was brought in by someone I’m close to? For what it’s worth, he knows I’m not happy in my current job, but doesn’t know quite how close to leaving I am. tldr: Will taking a new job after two months be career suicide?

Hey guys, Not sure if it’s just me but I always feel pressure to attend social events after work all the time especially here at a Big 4. The culture makes it a taboo to not attend an event because it makes you look like a slacker and that’s just not the case. Sometimes people don’t want to attend events because they don’t feel like it or have other things to take care of. For example, last month I was at a client and our service line (different industry though) was putting together (an optional) 5K for breast cancer. I happened to be out on a client where the director was the person that organized it and it started at 6:00 pm and lots of things were due since I was going to roll off. I remember she asked me the day before the race if I doing it and I told her no I wouldn’t be able to. The next day, I came in and she didn’t acknowledge me or say bye before leaving the race (which she usually does). Stuff like that makes me feel so pressured to attend events because then to me it makes me look bad because it will be somehow tied to my performance/character and will affect my promotions/salary/etc. I may also be over analyzing it too.

reddit_2191,"Black mothers are dying in childbirth 3-4x more than white mothers in the U.S. Hey all! I’m a producer for Empowered Health, a new podcast that is aiming to demystify women’s health. We just put out the first episode of our two-part series on the maternal mortality crisis. Episode one explores how race plays a role in this crisis– it becomes clear our culture isn't doing enough to protect black mothers. Black women are three to four times more likely than non-Hispanic white women to die during childbirth. That’s even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, like education and income. As more than one researcher said to us, the birthing crisis is the canary in the coal mine of women's health. It is a problem of women not being listened to, not being respected and being disempowered during a time in life when they should feel entitled to good care and a personal feeling of empowerment, feeling full of feminine power and purpose. Dr. Neel Shah, the director of the Delivery Decisions Initiative at Ariadne Labs, breaks down how medical students are trained to be biased and how that contributes to this problem. Fatima Dainkeh of YWCABoston helps us understand actually talking to black mothers is a good place to start and that a day-long workshop on bias isn't going to cut it. Midwife Ebony Marcelle shares how she's shaped her care model to better serve African American mothers. And, Dr. Mary-Ann Etiebet, the executive director of Merck for Mothers, looks at the global initiative she heads working to integrating the voices of black women into maternal mortality and morbidity.

I give you that background because I acknowledge they are some of the most misogynistic people in this country. but: It's ironic.

Lots of stations with people administering doses. We have pharmacy techs, med students, nursing students and other more experienced professionals should questions arise or a medical emergency result from a vaccination (there were none). This very special patient asked if one of the men from the other booth could supervise the injection.

Then about 1/2 minutes later a older man pulled his car over and offered to drive me home. This dude didn’t understand no until I said it to him a few times. I managed to get him to leave but I was still terrified as fuck and came home a complete mess. I actually walked the rest of the way home with my shopping bad clutched to my chest because I was so scared it would happen again.

reddit_2413,"What kind of future/career advancement is there in working for an organization that facilitates students doing a semester abroad? So I (34M) have been an ESL teacher in Spain for the last 6 years. I had a smattering of jobs before that but nothing that would amount to a career. Teaching has been great (sort of) but I decided that it isn't what I want to to long term and I needed to start thinking about alternatives while continuing to live in Barcelona, which is where I have built my life. Last year, I ended up doing a masters in marketing and sales hoping to facilitate a career change. Now, I knew that no one was going to be busting down my door to get at me for simply having a masters, but man oh man have I been surprised at just how little it seems to matter! I've been looking since May and I got close once but other than that I've had little luck. I can't even find and internship willing to touch me! I can't tell how frustrating and disheartening all this has been. Anyway, so I recently applied to a Program Coordinator for an organization that facilitates students doing a semester abroad and I have an interview lined up. It honestly seems like an interesting position and something that I could be good in, but I'm getting older and I really need to start thinking long-term. Also, it wouldn't be in marketing, which is fine, but I feel like i will have gotten (and paid for) this degree for nothing essentially. But that might be a but of sunk cost fallacy. Do you guys think this kind of position could lead to a sustainable career? What sort of experience would this give me to bring to future positions, either abroad or back in the US? Could I take this kind of experience to work at a University in some capacity? Any other advice would be most appreciated.

She told me that when he read books to the children in his class he would switch the stereotypes around. In a well known Dutch childrens book a mother is making breakfast in the kitchen and the father walks by and steps on his bike to ride to work (without saying hello to his wife). He would say the HUSBAND was making food and the WIFE left to go to work. He would change other things as well like he would have girls play in the mud, instead of braiding hair, and he would have boys who didn't like soccer. My grandma, who was also a teacher, would sometimes look around the corner and listen to how he changed the stories because she loved the reaction of the kids. She said that at first they were confused ""Huhhh? Why is their mum going to work?""

The instructions on the test were to only do the two easy questions on the back. This taught me to always take the extra few seconds to read the instructions. The second thing he did was he pretended to be a Martian, and on Mars they only eat sloppy Joe’s that come straight from the motion sensor tap, and we had to verbally walk him through making a PB&J sandwich. He would deliberately misinterpret our instructions, hitting the jar of PB, against the table when we said to “open the jelly”, or twisting the wrong end of the jar the wrong way when we said to twist the top off.

I had been asked to make a guide on using a certain program and had done so with the mind of producing this for teachers. However, my colleague who is at the same level as me but whom I was working with on this task had intended this recourse to be used by students. This led to some confusion and the work I produced was not to the desired level. With this in mind my boss wanted to talk to me in a formal manner regarding expectations and the level of work we produce. However, I feel that this is too sever of a step and I feel that I have essentially been given a disciplinary over a miscommunication. I feel that this is completely one sided and that there were no clear expectations or examples given of what to produce. I also feel that I shouldn't be solely responsible for this and it is equally my colleagues fault for simply telling me to make a guide without specifying who for.

We have been calling these moments our “If I Wasn’t a Child” moments, because we would’ve handled them much differently if we weren’t children.

I turned to my two friends (who were also black girls) and said something like “I feel like that’s a word black moms use ONLY when they’re angry with you.” We all laughed because we couldn’t recall our moms using that word in any other instance.

Just because the victim was a 14 year old boy who thought it was cool at first and had sex “willingly” with his 30 year old female teacher, doesn’t mean it wasn’t a rape. Rape is about consent. If other doesn’t give a consent, it’s a rape. That why you can’t have sex with a sleeping person. Also just not saying yes or being silent isn’t a consent. And that’s why it’s a rape when you ahve send with someone who can’t give a consent. Like someone who is mentally disabled. Guess who also can’t consent; kids! Why is it so hard to understand? I’m so sick of this double standard that media is pulling out of their ass when it comes to boys. All these people are saying is that kids can consent when they say “well the boy wanted it” And just because it’s techie legal, doesn’t mean it’s morally correct. If you are a man/woman who searches for kids that are “easy to get” and work at place full of kids, there is something wrong with you. The fact that even if 2 adults consent but the other asks to stop in middle of the sex and you don’t stop, that’s still rape. So why is it, that having sex with a person, who mentally isn’t capable of consenting, is seen as “just having sex”? Just because you are “more powerful” that the other, doesn’t mean you can’t be raped. Ever heard of manipulating? “Well they were flirting and sexting.” And who’s fault is that?

reddit_2471,"Abuse of boys in Australian schools is OK with Australian Human Rights Commission In Australia earlier this year, parents of boys in several Australian schools were shocked when their son's were forced to stand in classes, and public apologise for their masculinity. Two schools were publicly identified (Braurer College, Victoria and Parkdale Secondary College, Victoria). The teachers handing out this abuse were also identified by the schools, and parents were promised the allegations would be investigated, and the issues addressed. To date, no-one has been held accountable for this public shaming and abuse of these boys. In addition, the Australian Human Rights Commissioner (Ros Croucher), the Australian Sex Discrimination Commissioner (Kate Jenkins) and the Australian National Children's Commissioner (Megan Mitchell), all women with entrenched misandrist beliefs about toxic masculinity, have done nothing to investigate, and have had nothing to say about these disturbing events. In fact, the Australian Human Rights Commission web site has no record of these events at all, despite both reported events and schools apearing in 100s of news reports over a period of several months. It appears that the Australian Human Rights Commission supports and endorses the abuse of boys in Australian Schools, enabling the continuing discrimination against boys in the Australian education system and community generally, while blithely continuing to concentrate on the rights and privileges of women and girls.

I enjoy working with the documents and having multi week breaks between projects. While the money is not incredible, for where I live it makes for a decent living (without a JD). I realize that for the companies I primarily work for (upon earning my JD) pay will increase for projects to $25-$40 an hour. Working for these companies has brought me to realize, I may enjoy a career out of this such as potentially becoming a project manager and on up. Personally, I did not join the legal career for the more lucrative forms of law such as becoming a trial lawyer, etc. Is it wrong that I am interested in a career in document review?

reddit_2516,"""Free Willy"" another article taking glee and glamourising the sick and barbaric act of women sexually attacking men and castrating them in acts of 'revenge'. We don't even need to think about what the reaction to a headline like this would be if it were a list of men cutting off their female partners' sexual organs. It would be written a thousand times worse even if it were just about men slapping their partners even if it were 'justified' by claims of infidelity. Yet here we have a group of women who are often heroised for doing one of the worst things you can do to a human being and it is in the name of 'revenge' for things like cheating on them. Firstly, I strongly suspect a large number of them are lying about their partners cheating to give them an excuse for being psychopaths and the lawyers will be encouraging this. But imagine if men were all cheering in support of a man who beat his wife, let alone cut off her clitoris, destroyed her ovaries and stopped her from ever having sex again, because she cheated on him. Whilst the news story showed pictures of bloody women laying on the floor or in hospital with cheeky puns as a title.

reddit_2518,"Welcome to Brazil, where sexist laws are passed I'm going to say something funny in Brazil. The entity responsible for statistics on domestic violence requires that only cases of violence against children, the elderly, and women be reported by the police stations. This makes it appear that women are the main victims of domestic violence. Now it gets thicker, men are in the lead with a lot of space ahead of women in terms of general violence. So statistically they are the ones who suffer the most from domestic violence, but here we will never really know, as the person responsible for this information creates a ""favorable"" environment for women. And how can not stop there. Here, due to sexist laws, a man who ends up in the ICU is less serious than a woman who is slapped. Here the penalty for a crime committed by a woman is lesser just for being a woman, and a crime committed against a woman has aggravations. And as if all this is not enough, in 2021 a law that opens a huge loophole for anything to become a crime against women was approved. In direct translation: Law 14188 of 2021 also includes in the Penal Code the crime of psychological violence against women, to be attributed to those who cause emotional harm ""that harms and disturbs their full development or that seeks to degrade or control their actions, behaviors, beliefs and decisions ”. A fews days after this law, news came out of lawyers wanting to use this law because the boyfriend broke up with the girl. And as all this is not enough.

reddit_2533,"Posing with artwork I'm sure most of you have witnessed this phenomenon. A woman will post a piece of artwork to reddit, with her face or body in the picture, and without fail dozens of people will voice their displeasure. I don't think I've seen a single post of a woman with her artwork that didn't have several negative or boderline abusive comments of that nature. Whenever people call out these commenters on their misogyny, their defence is usually something like: ""It's not because she's a woman! I'd say the same if a man did it, but men never get upvoted."" Now today, I see a picture just like that, but with a male artist posing in it. The post has tens of thousands of upvotes and over a thousand comments. As I scrolled through them, I couldn't help but notice the distinct lack of any of those complaints. Nobody accusing him of using his attractiveness for clout, nobody annoyed at having to zoom in to see the painting, nobody preaching about how the art should speak for itself. Any criticisms were purely about the art itself. There were even several comments praising the artist's good looks, and they weren't downvoted or called simps. So, it really isn't about the ""integrity of the art"" is it? They don't say the same thing when it's a man showing off his work and being proud of his talents. It's pure sexism. Nothing against the artist in question, of course, but he happened to perfectly showcase the double standard.

And I honestly had the thought of... “I would not feel comfortable having a man tattoo me” My friend on the other hand has no problem with a male artist, her view was that the best artist for the design is the one she wants to tattoo her. I have no real reason to distrust male tattoo artists, I know the 99.9% of them are professional, clean and safe...but I would just feel uneasy. My friend then raised the point that my view might be a little sexist. I feel uneasy based on my preconceived notions and I don’t really want to change them...ya know, I just don’t want to go to male artist and have them put something so intimate on my body!

The men and women, guys and girls of the ‘manosphere’: A corpus-assisted discourse approach Abstract This study investigates how the lemmas woman, girl, man and guy are used to discursively represent and construct gender identities in an anti-feminist forum on the discussion website Reddit. The lemmas were analysed using corpus-assisted social actor analysis and appraisal theory. Similarities and differences within three sub-communities of the TRP subreddit were considered: Men’s Rights (activists who believe that men are systemically disadvantaged in society), Men Going Their Own Way (who abstain from relationships with women), and Red Pill Theory (primarily pick-up artists). * The corpus was characterised by bare assertions about gendered behaviour, although the masculine gender role was less well-defined than the feminine one. Women and girls were dehumanised and sexually objectified, negatively judged for morality and veracity, and constructed as desiring hostile behaviour from male social actors. Conversely, men were constructed as victims of female social actors and external institutions and, as a result, as unhappy and insecure. Well, at least the bolded part seems more or less correct.

reddit_2580,"TIL It’s legal and common practice in areas for medical students and residents to perform unnecessary pelvic exams on women under anesthesia. I came across a TikTok today that explained how there are many states in the US that don’t require explicit consent from patients for medical students or residents to perform unnecessary pelvic exams on women who are unconscious. These are done purely for the benefit of the medical student to learn how to perform pelvic exams and are used during completely unrelated procedures. Apparently, as long as you consent to medical students participating in your care, it is considered “implied consent”. Being a Canadian, I decided to look it up in my country. This was standard practice prior to 2006 when it was banned. In 2010, they changed the ruling slightly which actually still allows residents to perform these procedures now without explicit consent... all in the name of “learning”. Many doctors spoke up against the ban wondering how it would be possible for medical students to learn without doing it secretly. Women are being treated like cadavers or practice dummies and many are none the wiser. I even read one story in which a woman was informed by a medical student that she had started her period when she had abdominal surgery. She asked how he would know that and that’s when she was told he had performed this procedure completely irrelevant to her surgery. Please check with your state or government to see if there is such a law to protect you.

They are now up for foster care and adoption. I've seen, heard, experienced so many more stories of having agency taken away within medical confines. Not to mention the schools systems where many districts are attempting to erase any sort of black history and deny that slavery even existed. I remember the bias I experienced from white teachers growing up. Living at one point in a southern town where white women teachers were given permission to use actual physical force upon me. Do you know how traumatic that can be? To give birth to children that will experience the racism and microaggressions is very disheartening from having the will to even bother. I am tired and barely able to handle them myself. I understand that their are ways to also supplement teaching black history at home, but I shouldn't even have to. Am I not American too?

I’m also pro-choice and needed someone to talk to about BC options for me. Had a bad experience with white male docs last summer and I wasn’t trying to subject myself to that again. I don’t want to get too deep into it, but basically I live in a very predominantly white + Asian area (bay area CA) and needed to see an obgyn. I searched all over the internet to find this woman, and I guessed judged a book by its cover. Went in last week and the first thing I saw in the office were mommy magazines and tiny figurines of what I assume was the birth of baby Jesus on the front desk. I should’ve known from that point that I didn’t need to be there. 😅 When she saw me it was like the nice act immediately dropped once it was clear I wasn’t looking to have a baby anytime soon. She was very cold and matter of fact with me, and wasn’t very welcoming or understanding. Didn’t show any compassion when I told her my story. I even tried to hint at how hard it is to find the right doctor as a black woman and she didn’t really pick up on that. She did my Pap smear (didn’t warn me about the discomfort either) and then had her nurse tell me days later I had BV and needed to pick up a prescription that has since been giving me terrible nausea. Now I know not all black women are the same, and that maybe I shouldn’t have expected a grandmotherly experience just because we share skin color.

Im feeing a tad bit annoyed, and find that there is a disturbing theme throughout the show. The black women (Nurse April, Nurse Maggie, Dr. Robin Charles, and Sharon Goodwin) all struggle with their relationships. Like extreme struggles. One man had a juvenile record and false identity. Another husband left the wife and got with someone new, an engagement fell through, and with the successful doctor she ends up having a tumor and she suffers mentally so she decides to leave her relationship. This trend is disturbing to me. Of course we’ve seen this in other shows and movies. The black woman is always alone and has been done wrong. No happiness for the black women in these shows. It portrays a very negative image of black women, that we are somehow incapable of finding healthy love. This makes it difficult sometimes to enjoy a show. I’m just super aware of things like this.

reddit_2624,"PSA: the stable career fields that are considered as staples for Asians once had very few Asians. The reason why I'm writing this is because I am reminded of an [op-ed]( by broadway actress Ashley Park. There was this one part that stood out to me: > If you’re educated in a traditional profession—like if you’re a doctor or a lawyer—no one can take that away from you. Those jobs have stability. So I can see how it could be so hard for immigrant parents to support their kids who want to go into the arts when they’re looking at TV and stages and don’t see any Asian people there. There’s no way parents can expect that their kids could succeed in that if they don’t see it happening. Of course, the professions of medicine, law, STEM, etc are considered as safe and stable career choices for Asians. But let me also tell you that at one point in history, that was not the case at all, especially for Asian American women. It took certain people to push and break the barriers. For example, Patsy Mink, former senator from Hawaii, initially wanted to pursue a career in medicine but couldn't due to the discriminations she faced as an Asian woman. So she turned to law instead. Even in that field she faced numerous challenges. But she fought and pushed through. So if you ever feel discouraged from going into a certain field because of the lack of representation, don't. I do understand that there are various other reasons why people get discouraged from pursuing a certain career, such as lack of pay and job stability. However bottom line is don't pigeonhole yourself into something which society expects of you. Imagine if Patsy decided to give up just because there weren't anybody like her in her field?

By three I was already taught to sit down, shut up, and no matter what obey At Four I was in daycare and got in trouble for playing with the boys. Five I was given a babydoll to nurture and take care of while the guys got actual toys At six I’d already started kindergarten and I could show I was more than a pretty smile. I was seven when the boy on my street said I was his favorite and invited me to his playhouse for a while At eight no one believed what I said no matter how many times I repeated what happened to me.

Like, how said creepy writers often try to fall back on the excuse of “I sexed up my design for this female character and had her making out with everyone because she’s a modern woman!” Except; they haven’t done it with good intent? Because they’re not writing anything for the woman’s benefit or satisfaction, but for that of their male MC? Or to lift up their ego’s at the expense of their female characters? Female characters who, unfortunately, come off as one-dimensional and flat. Sorry if this doesn’t belong here, but I’ve been running into this attitude a lot lately and, I think I finally pinned down the issue: Intent. For example; in Sonic the Hedgehog, -why- was eighteen year old Rouge the Bat designed to be a sultry, sexy piece of eye-candy? Was it really for the benefit of the female portion of the fandom that existed back in 2002 (I was part of that by the way—just the clarify, we existed, duh,) or was it to satisfy the wants and needs of the male voyeurs thirsting for…well. Same as how Amy Pond was written by Steven Moffat in Doctor Who. Why did he choose to write her as a stripper? Why couldn’t her boyfriend Rory have been the stripper thirsting for the Doctor and Amy the head-strong nurse in training?

I understand there has to be an Anesthesiologist who ""oversees"" this service, but I also know that the Anesthesiologist can do so without almost ever stepping foot in the place- a qualified nurse can easily administer laughing gas. Side note: GYNO appointments were never a super anxious thing for me UNTIL I experienced the absolute bloody horror and trauma of getting an IUD placed. After that, I haven't been able to walk into my Dr's office without bawling in anticipation of sheer pain. So ridiculous. (I got my IUD out over a year ago- fuck that shit, never again will I do that to my body.

reddit_2665,"Ethics of discharge police custody under warrant Internal medicine hospitalist (US) In the past 2-3 months I've had 2 cases where the here ultimate disposition with the aid of psych and intensivist was to discharge to the police under existing warrants. Essentially the cases are 1. A woman is admitted under Baker act (Florida's law for hold in re psychiatric illness). I saw her, she's medically stable but says she is suicidal. I say ok, as long as there's a bed we'll transfer you to our mental health unit until psychiatry clears you. Psychiatry comes in just after me and says, yea law enforcement contacted us, she has a warrant for something unrelated. She is clear for discharge to their custody. After speaking to psych they tell me they have more resources to help her. Honestly, I thought she was a reasonable person, and aside from her suicidal ideation at the time, she would be fine in the real world. 2. Gentleman comes in hx of schizophrenia and self-harm. Again baker act. Admitted to ICU because he needs sedation and they tube him. He's extubated and reasonably stable. Intensivist tells me (really the nurses tell me) they initially try for transfer to a med psych hospital but this is unlikely. Ultimately, they come up with that Thishe again has a warrant, we'll discharge him to police custody. This guy was a bit iffier and needed more help because of additional factors that I don't want to give in the off chance he is identifiable. I'm 2 years out of residency. It was my understanding: 1. Come from jail, go back to jail. 2. Come in under arrest, go back to police custody.

reddit_2673,"I washed my patient’s hair yesterday So there’s a woman who’s been on our unit for a couple of months and has been at the hospital since June. The prolonged hospital stay is due to her having a recent AKA which got infected as well as many other things. Since she has been here so long she developed psoriasis in her scalp and her hair became super dr, flaky, one of the worst I have seen. No one has had bothered to give her a shower because she is a bigger woman, max assist, and it would take lots of people to help her for being such a high fall risk. Today was my first time having her. Im on a med-surg unit with a 1:5 ratio. She was complaining about her hair and I asked how long it has been since she washed it. She said maybe a month ago and she started to break down and cry. She told me it’s not no one’s fault, that we are always short staffed, there’s priority over other things than this— that she kinda gave up asking. I felt for her, and I couldn’t even imagine what my scalp would feel like if I had neglected it for SO long. So i grabbed a wash bin, some towels, and ordered shampoo and washed her hair. I’m so lucky none of my lights went off for half an hour that I was with her. Normally I don’t have time for stuff like this with my ratio and being short a nurse and tech. She literally cried tears of joy when i was done and kept thanking me. I stayed after work for a bit to catch up on some charting but it was so worth it.

I don’t want to get too deep into it, but basically I live in a very predominantly white + Asian area (bay area CA) and needed to see an obgyn. I searched all over the internet to find this woman, and I guessed judged a book by its cover.

I should’ve known from that point that I didn’t need to be there. 😅 When she saw me it was like the nice act immediately dropped once it was clear I wasn’t looking to have a baby anytime soon. She was very cold and matter of fact with me, and wasn’t very welcoming or understanding. Didn’t show any compassion when I told her my story. I even tried to hint at how hard it is to find the right doctor as a black woman and she didn’t really pick up on that.

I’m asking this question here because I feel like there is some cultural competence needed, and I want to hear the opinions/experiences of other black women (because, doctors are to black women what cops are to black men, so they say). Basically, I’ve been on a combo birth control for like 15 years. Started when I was young due to extremely heavy bleeding and all the women in my family having female cancers. The pill was supposed to reduce my risk of female cancers and deal with the heavy periods. It’s been working fine all this time. Until about a month ago when everything just went haywire and I’m spotting like crazy. So, I reach out to Planned Parenthood to see if perhaps I need to restart my pill or try a similar one, and the nurse tells me that I need to stop my birth control pills immediately, because combo pills are dangerous for people w/ migraines with auras because it increases risk for stroke. She was like YOU HAVE TO STOP. I appreciate her, but I’ve been on the pill for over 15 years, and I assume that this decision was made, and was continued to be made because of weighing the risks and because my period can’t be controlled without it. Also, no one has ever told me this before! So now I’m like, so I change up a pill that my entire medical team is aware that I’m on because this woman said so? Or do I seek more information? I did some research just now, and it looks like the risk of stroke can be higher, but it’s unclear how much higher it is versus just being on birth control, which carries a risk of stroke.

Especially considering that while women obviously have the capacity to work in STEM or as firefighters, those fields are completely well off without women. Being a woman doesn't really add anything to how useful you can be as a computer scientist for example. However, if more men became say, kindergarten or elementary school teachers, that would actually benefit young boys, since they would have a better chance of having good male role models and male authority figures in their lives, not to mention teachers they can relate to much better. I also heard from one of my friends who's training to be a social worker that people in that field consider the low number of men in social work to be a problem, since men often judge situations (eg. family issues) differently and therefore a good balance of male and female social workers would be ideal.

After three years as a manager, she finally made the team. For three more years, she worked incredibly hard to get play time, a premium for her. Her senior year she finally had enough and moved on because she'd made her point: she could do it. This year, my strong, independent, bullheaded baby girl graduated from one of the top engineering schools in the country. It wasn't easy. She fought every day to succeed, to be taken seriously by the men in her classes and by her instructors, too succeed in her studies. She took mechanical engineering - a field with a 15/85 women to men ratio - because making things makes her happy (even if she cut off part of her finger in shop class in high school). It wasn't uncommon for her to be the only woman in her class. A month ago, she graduated. She made her point: she could do it. Today, she received her second job offer in a week.

I (26F) had a conversation with my mum recently, where she was telling me her friend is looking for a wife for her son. For a short background- this guy is my age 26M, well educated and working as a software engineer in an egalitarian northern European country same as me. So his mother is looking for a wife for him so her son has some company and doesn't feel lonely. But then she goes on to add how it will be nice if the potential wife enjoys doing house chores ( she said it as if it's a hobby) so it helps out her son, and he can focus more on his work! This really triggered me as I'm his age, and living in this same European country which really gives the women the same respect as men. To me this country gave me the freedom to walk on the streets at night alone without being scared and wearing whatever I want without anyone saying anything. I love my freedom, the equality I get and more importantly love my career. And I couldn't imagine how could someone ask another girl my age to give up their dreams and ambitions to do house chores as a hobby in this country ? Didn't the guy pick up any nice qualities living here ? Also I was so mad at my mother for being okay with what this woman said. And being a woman herself how could she do this?

We were nerding out 200% and I was having fun. The whole workshop went on for a few days like that. So a day or so after this the guy stopped me in the corridor and APOLOGIZED.

I appreciate all of the shared stories relating to problems with consent, boundaries, abortion rights (aka lack of...), workplace sexism, and relationship sexism. These topics are really important and I think it might be time to share what makes us feel powerful and impactful in our day to day lives. I'll go first- One of the best parts of being a woman, in my opinion, is the friendships I share with other women. The connection I have with my girlfriends is unlike anything i've ever experience in male friendships. Women look out for and support each other in a unique way. I consider myself so lucky to have incredible friendships that fall into this category, Also, I feel so lucky to be a woman at a time where we have more opportunities to chart our own paths, especially in STEM fields. I returned to school in my early 20's to get my BS in mechanical engineering and appreciate the skill set it provides me with. I hope that I'll be able to support other women entering STEM fields in the future, once I am employed in the field. Often, people are taken aback when they hear I'm studying MechE. I always think its because my personal interests align with those often stereotyped as ""girly.""

reddit_2798,"Director wants to cast me as a monkey, really need advice So for context, I am an underclassmen in a Texas high school. My school’s theatre department (which I am heavily involved in) has a tradition called senior directs, where all the seniors in our class get to direct their own shows. The shows that were picked this year were picked by our teacher, usually they get to go and find their own shows or write one. There is one show that involves three monkeys in a cage that is being directed by this white guy (he got first pick out of the shows the teacher is letting them do, and he chose this one). I know he wants me to be one of the monkeys in his show because when we were table reading all the shows as a class today, he picked me to read. When I later asked why he wanted me to be in his show, he said “The one you read for is sort of the leader, and is also kind of bitchy.” I really do not want to be casted as a monkey because not only was the show boring as ever, but I am a black woman, and it is a goddamn monkey. It would be crappy for anyone, but I feel like because of my race it’s just dehumanizing. I’m not sure if I’m making too big a deal out of this, because the other 2 black girls in my class aren’t too worried about it. We haven’t auditioned yet officially, but I’m pretty sure none of the other seniors want me for their shows, so it’s almost set in stone. Do I tell my teacher that I’m not comfortable with being a monkey? Or do I just suck it up for the role?

I’m leaving this town soon enough, thank god, but it’s been hell. I’ve learned to avoid all other moms by this point. My daughter is in kindergarten and she looks almost completely white. I’m asian. People treat me like I don’t exist. They will talk to my FIVE year old before they even talk to me.

I’ve been to play centers where some people just stare at me until I stare back at them and they make some stupid excuse like “omg your daughter looks just like you.” someone literally said that and I had to pretend I actually believed that horseshit.

I'm sure all encountered the usual ""more women on STEM"" or ""more women as firefighters/soldiers"" shit before, which is fine to a certain degree I guess, but how come society doesn't encourage men to work as nurses, social workers or in early education? Especially considering that while women obviously have the capacity to work in STEM or as firefighters, those fields are completely well off without women. Being a woman doesn't really add anything to how useful you can be as a computer scientist for example. However, if more men became say, kindergarten or elementary school teachers, that would actually benefit young boys, since they would have a better chance of having good male role models and male authority figures in their lives, not to mention teachers they can relate to much better. I also heard from one of my friends who's training to be a social worker that people in that field consider the low number of men in social work to be a problem, since men often judge situations (eg. family issues) differently and therefore a good balance of male and female social workers would be ideal.

The teachers handing out this abuse were also identified by the schools, and parents were promised the allegations would be investigated, and the issues addressed. To date, no-one has been held accountable for this public shaming and abuse of these boys. In addition, the Australian Human Rights Commissioner (Ros Croucher), the Australian Sex Discrimination Commissioner (Kate Jenkins) and the Australian National Children's Commissioner (Megan Mitchell), all women with entrenched misandrist beliefs about toxic masculinity, have done nothing to investigate, and have had nothing to say about these disturbing events. In fact, the Australian Human Rights Commission web site has no record of these events at all, despite both reported events and schools apearing in 100s of news reports over a period of several months.

reddit_2848,"PSA: the stable career fields that are considered as staples for Asians once had very few Asians. The reason why I'm writing this is because I am reminded of an [op-ed]( by broadway actress Ashley Park. There was this one part that stood out to me: > If you’re educated in a traditional profession—like if you’re a doctor or a lawyer—no one can take that away from you. Those jobs have stability. So I can see how it could be so hard for immigrant parents to support their kids who want to go into the arts when they’re looking at TV and stages and don’t see any Asian people there. There’s no way parents can expect that their kids could succeed in that if they don’t see it happening. Of course, the professions of medicine, law, STEM, etc are considered as safe and stable career choices for Asians. But let me also tell you that at one point in history, that was not the case at all, especially for Asian American women. It took certain people to push and break the barriers. For example, Patsy Mink, former senator from Hawaii, initially wanted to pursue a career in medicine but couldn't due to the discriminations she faced as an Asian woman. So she turned to law instead. Even in that field she faced numerous challenges. But she fought and pushed through. So if you ever feel discouraged from going into a certain field because of the lack of representation, don't. I do understand that there are various other reasons why people get discouraged from pursuing a certain career, such as lack of pay and job stability. However bottom line is don't pigeonhole yourself into something which society expects of you. Imagine if Patsy decided to give up just because there weren't anybody like her in her field?

reddit_2856,"Welcome to Brazil, where sexist laws are passed I'm going to say something funny in Brazil. The entity responsible for statistics on domestic violence requires that only cases of violence against children, the elderly, and women be reported by the police stations.

So statistically they are the ones who suffer the most from domestic violence, but here we will never really know, as the person responsible for this information creates a ""favorable"" environment for women. And how can not stop there. Here, due to sexist laws, a man who ends up in the ICU is less serious than a woman who is slapped. Here the penalty for a crime committed by a woman is lesser just for being a woman, and a crime committed against a woman has aggravations. And as if all this is not enough, in 2021 a law that opens a huge loophole for anything to become a crime against women was approved. In direct translation: Law 14188 of 2021 also includes in the Penal Code the crime of psychological violence against women, to be attributed to those who cause emotional harm ""that harms and disturbs their full development or that seeks to degrade or control their actions, behaviors, beliefs and decisions ”. A fews days after this law, news came out of lawyers wanting to use this law because the boyfriend broke up with the girl. And as all this is not enough.

A woman will post a piece of artwork to reddit, with her face or body in the picture, and without fail dozens of people will voice their displeasure. I don't think I've seen a single post of a woman with her artwork that didn't have several negative or boderline abusive comments of that nature. Whenever people call out these commenters on their misogyny, their defence is usually something like: ""It's not because she's a woman! I'd say the same if a man did it, but men never get upvoted."" Now today, I see a picture just like that, but with a male artist posing in it. The post has tens of thousands of upvotes and over a thousand comments. As I scrolled through them, I couldn't help but notice the distinct lack of any of those complaints. Nobody accusing him of using his attractiveness for clout, nobody annoyed at having to zoom in to see the painting, nobody preaching about how the art should speak for itself. Any criticisms were purely about the art itself. There were even several comments praising the artist's good looks, and they weren't downvoted or called simps. So, it really isn't about the ""integrity of the art"" is it? They don't say the same thing when it's a man showing off his work and being proud of his talents. It's pure sexism.

The lemmas were analysed using corpus-assisted social actor analysis and appraisal theory. Similarities and differences within three sub-communities of the TRP subreddit were considered: Men’s Rights (activists who believe that men are systemically disadvantaged in society), Men Going Their Own Way (who abstain from relationships with women), and Red Pill Theory (primarily pick-up artists). * The corpus was characterised by bare assertions about gendered behaviour, although the masculine gender role was less well-defined than the feminine one. Women and girls were dehumanised and sexually objectified, negatively judged for morality and veracity, and constructed as desiring hostile behaviour from male social actors. Conversely, men were constructed as victims of female social actors and external institutions and, as a result, as unhappy and insecure. Well, at least the bolded part seems more or less correct.

reddit_2914,"Opinions On Ethnic Women Having Blonde Hair So, here's the situation. I recently dyed my hair blonde, and it took a lot for me to muster up the courage to not care about having blonde hair as an Asian-American. Of course, you see a bunch of Asian American women with a blonde balayage, and they look amazing with it. I have had light brown hair for over a year, and I just really felt inclined to switch it up late last year because I needed a fresh new start (things ended badly with the guy I was dating). I thought going blonde would help me feel more confident, but instead it makes me feel so weird about myself in public (especially when I am hanging out with my white friends). I have this perception that people think I am trying to be something I am not (""act white"") and that as an Asian American, I should stick to the darker hair colors. I know that so many non-white women can rock the blonde hair (I was inspired by yanyanchan on IG) and that wanting to be blonde does not stem from a desire to look Caucasian. The blonde color is just pretty (especially when you wear so much black clothing) and can spice up your hair. I was just wondering what everyone's views are on this. Have any of you guys regretted going blonde or felt weird about being a blonde when you aren't white? I spent hundreds of dollars to go blonde, and now that I am, I feel like I should just go back to the salon and dye it brown/black again.

And I'm not talking about spegatti coders or incompetent people (Although that's usually what peanuts gets), what I'm trying to say that for the same job in the same level a 100k job in America is 10k here- end of story. So if they pay me let's say 30k and another 20k from them in tax and crap.But still it's a win win situation for both. I mean corona fucked everything up.It has definitely globalised me and millions of others.So instead of paying local tutor, I'm accessing the top uni courses, downloading their textbooks and following that curriculum and planning to grind the same leetcode.The culture has been also quite neutralized in the few years.So if I'm in the mainstream American learning system,can I enter the job market as well? I mean not now.But think about next five years.We already see big companies doing it .Even have non American CEO.So will the smaller ones follow? like what's your opinion and thoughts.Knowing I'm studying for 50k vs 10k is a big difference.One can make you sit in front of the black screen day and night,but the other is not so exciting",reddit,covid_era,2021,race_authority,[],"['black', 'american']",[],['ceo'],NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL,0.563391923904419,0.996366024017334,0.5354668498039246,0.9944444444444445

reddit_2943,"First Week as Director of Finance in a small non-profit Good Evening everyone, &#x200B; First up I am going to cross post this to a couple reddits since it does not seem to have a specific place that is perfect for it, if you have a suggestion of another reddit to post it to that would be better please let me know! &#x200B; Bit of background: I started a position as director of finance for a small (5 staff, 50 faculty) non-profit this week. There is no direct handover of duties from the previous director who left about a month before I started. The CEO has enough experience with the systems to work through the payrolls in between and some bills were paid but not entered anywhere. With the small staff I will be managing everything from basic bookkeeping to working with the finance committee of the board. &#x200B; My Current plan I am going to focus on getting the items entered that were missed, learn how to do payroll and process that and then close the month of March since that has not happened yet. After that I want to get through to the audit at fiscal year end in June. Beyond that I would like to make some larger changes but that is for some other post in the future. &#x200B; My Questions: 1. Where would you start? There is a ton of information to take in and a lot of work to be caught up on. What would you start with? 2. What would you plan to do in the first week? Month? Year? 3. Does anyone have any experience with the BlackBaud program Financial Edge? 99% of my experience is with quick books and sage. Any tips or tricks for this program would be appreciated.

reddit_2950,"Waiting for decision for a job I really want (+2 days and counting) I was terminated last December from a hedge fund due to a very toxic fallout (the person doing the firing couldn't look me in the eyes). And I spent about a month and a half after that trying to heal from the situation. I was burnt out going into the job search, and only applied to 2 companies that I was sure would not be toxic (I am in tech so there are always jobs available and almost every well-known place there is reputation of a bro culture). One of them turned out to be a dream job. I never knew I would be excited to work again. Anyways, final round went smoothly, or so I thought, and the recruiter said they'd reach a decision sometime a week later. It's now been 8 days and a follow-up email later, and I still haven't heard back anything. I restarted the application process, now armed with the optimism that maybe I can find a job that I love in an environment that doesn't belittle or despise me. It was hard coming to terms with a job that felt so right was not meant to be yesterday, but I suppose that is a part of life. Edit (Context): I am an Asian female in STEM. As the only woman on all teams I've been in, it feels like I've been fighting to belong my whole life. Yesterday I watched a tiktok video of a black woman receiving feedback about being perceived as aggressive and threatening despite sitting at a meeting quietly and saying nothing while a white guy jumped up and down and cursed at the same meeting and received no feedback. My problems are probably not as egregious, but I am struggling with the same question: how do you act on feedback that is about what you are instead of what you did? My mother tells me that it is okay and just do my best.

reddit_2955,"Did we forget that we are teaching children? This is my 3rd year teaching (graduated just in time for the pandemic to hit-- lucky me) and I sometimes wonder if my administration forgets that we are teaching actual children, not just numbers filling a seat. I think that my educational philosophy doesn't align with my school's. Admin is, in my opinion, far too strict on things that I could give a rat's ass about, but not strict enough on stuff that actually matters. For example, a student was sent to the principal's office for wearing a jacket that had both red and black. Students are only allowed to wear jackets that are solidly black or solidly red. I would love if someone could explain to me how a student wearing red and black is disruptive enough to the learning environment that administration needs to get involved.

I personally do not see the harm in allowing students to write or draw on the board as, in my mind, they are just kids being kids. Why does everything have to be picked apart like that? Why can't kids draw on the boards? They're children. They draw. This year has been emotionally exhausting and my administration seems to be wildly out of touch.

They have a recruitment policy of interviewing 50% women, 50% men. My (male) manager has repeated this fact a few times. I'm unsure of his motivations for even sharing that info. Anyway I met my fiancé at work. He's otherwise a left-voting, kind and tolerant person. The reason I've made this post is because I told him we're getting two new members of staff, 1 man, 1 woman, and the man is called Igor and he's from Brazil. My boyfriend's responses were ""probably a transwoman or something"". My reaction was ? He went on to say that the woman was probably black and/or in a wheelchair. He just said he was concerned because the way they're handling things is going to result in a lot of young white men getting frustrated at having an unfair disadvantage and it'll backfire with more prejudice, if they keep losing out to them. He didn't use the term 'woke' but it seems like that line of argument has got through to him. I asked him how a Brazilian man would be unfairly advantaged, like we don't even know his race and Brazil has very different attitudes to race anyway.

I can’t move into other areas, like case management or outpatient, because they all require a year or two of bedside experience which I don’t have. Plus I have this black mark on my record from being fired by a major employer in my area. Other information about me. I have a masters degree and I’m 60 years old. Going back to school isn’t an option. Getting more education has had zero affect on my being able to get a job. Being 60 will make it impossible for me to get an internship anywhere. Even if I did I don’t know if I could keep up. I can’t retire. I need a job to pay bills. Is there any hope for me?

Where I live, clothing policies were very strict and formal when I started working 10 years ago. I had to wear a suit and a tie in Big 4 audit; firm policy, no casual fridays. Now, 10 years after that, most offices are smart casual, even Big 4. It has become acceptable for anyone to visibly show discrete tattoos. Today I was in the gym and 80% of other guys also have piercings. My point is, this has become very common among people my age and our generation is the bulk of the workforce from entry-level to senior positions. Women get these big nape tattoos and no one bats an eye. I had a manager with a dragon tattoo on his arm when I was in public. But piercings are still taboo for men. I love my face jewelry, I'm willing to use discrete black or transparent jewelry. But my discrete black jewelry look like moles. My monroe piercing looks like a realistic mole if I use a small black stud. Same with tragus, nostril, helix, lobe, etc. What are your thoughts, am I fucked or should I just do whatever I want with my face? I'm a good worker, according to most reviews. Basically I've gotten a fuckton of piercings because of lockdown and all offices being closed for a year (where I live). I won't set foot in an office for at least 12 more months, maybe even next year. And even like that people will still be required to wear a mask, which could conceal half my piercings.

reddit_3057,"Male names face discrimination in hiring A report we created took together evidence and found that men generally face higher rates of discrimination in hiring when it comes to male vs. female names \[1\]. Here are the research highlights: A male name is 13% less likely to be chosen than a female name for rental housing, and it goes as big of an anti-male gender gap as 33% in low-population areas for black male names vs. black female names (46% callback rate for men, and 79% callback rate for women) and male Muslim names are 50% less likely to be housed than female Muslim names. Comparatively, male names are less likely to be hired in female dominated jobs, and are 3.2% less likely to be hired than in blind hiring (vs. the 2.9% advantage women have). One study found that women were hired 2% less based off of their name, but it appeared to be biased, due to the fact that it only used 9 names and did not differentiate between lower class and higher class names. (If you look at the study you'll find that a male name, Jose Vazquez, had the highest negative response rate \[13%\] and nearly the lowest positive response rate \[81%\]. \[2\]) Female names are also possibly discriminated against in male-dominated jobs, as it depends on the job, for example a heavy-lifting job may be biased against them, but a STEM one is not (as they are biased towards 2:1 over EQUALLY or SLIGHTLY MORE qualified male candidates \[3\]). \[1\] Adams, Drew K.

reddit_3061,"Waiting for decision for a job I really want (+2 days and counting) I was terminated last December from a hedge fund due to a very toxic fallout (the person doing the firing couldn't look me in the eyes). And I spent about a month and a half after that trying to heal from the situation. I was burnt out going into the job search, and only applied to 2 companies that I was sure would not be toxic (I am in tech so there are always jobs available and almost every well-known place there is reputation of a bro culture). One of them turned out to be a dream job. I never knew I would be excited to work again. Anyways, final round went smoothly, or so I thought, and the recruiter said they'd reach a decision sometime a week later. It's now been 8 days and a follow-up email later, and I still haven't heard back anything. I restarted the application process, now armed with the optimism that maybe I can find a job that I love in an environment that doesn't belittle or despise me. It was hard coming to terms with a job that felt so right was not meant to be yesterday, but I suppose that is a part of life. Edit (Context): I am an Asian female in STEM. As the only woman on all teams I've been in, it feels like I've been fighting to belong my whole life.

I work in events and public outreach as well as having studied Physics so I have quite a lot of stories when it comes to 'inappropriate' behavior. Prompted by International Women's Day and my general openness to discuss how people have acted towards me she told me about some of her experiences being a black woman and immigrant who has to make off-site visits to residential buildings. I was not surprised and had voiced frustration that unlike my previous job there was not a clear path we were to follow when people within our org were inappropriate let alone clients we interacted with. Her message today was asking for advice on how to move forward with pushing the upper management as she has now taken on a team lead position and has more say in at least the team function (I also suspect that the hiring of significantly more women of color since I left is a factor). This org is relatively small (30-50 employees) and has no HR which has been a fairly contentious issue among staff as the median age of staff is likely around 30 while the directors are likely around 65.

I’m not sure if I feel this way cos the job or company isn’t for me or it’s me not dealing things well? Any advice on how to cope?

reddit_3099,"Opinions On Ethnic Women Having Blonde Hair So, here's the situation. I recently dyed my hair blonde, and it took a lot for me to muster up the courage to not care about having blonde hair as an Asian-American. Of course, you see a bunch of Asian American women with a blonde balayage, and they look amazing with it. I have had light brown hair for over a year, and I just really felt inclined to switch it up late last year because I needed a fresh new start (things ended badly with the guy I was dating). I thought going blonde would help me feel more confident, but instead it makes me feel so weird about myself in public (especially when I am hanging out with my white friends). I have this perception that people think I am trying to be something I am not (""act white"") and that as an Asian American, I should stick to the darker hair colors. I know that so many non-white women can rock the blonde hair (I was inspired by yanyanchan on IG) and that wanting to be blonde does not stem from a desire to look Caucasian. The blonde color is just pretty (especially when you wear so much black clothing) and can spice up your hair. I was just wondering what everyone's views are on this. Have any of you guys regretted going blonde or felt weird about being a blonde when you aren't white? I spent hundreds of dollars to go blonde, and now that I am, I feel like I should just go back to the salon and dye it brown/black again. I hate that I feel like this, but I've spent way too much time thinking about my hair.

He cornered me in the room we were, dragging me by the neck and then lifting me off the ground. Then he bites me hard in the neck and I got the teeth marks too... It hurts. I disassociated and couldn't say anything. There was some alcohol involved, it might have blurred my mind also. I didn't say anything. I know I felt scared. I'm living since 2 days with bruises and bite marks on my neck, shoulders, thighs. It's not a pleasant experience. So, I know he couldn't read my mind.

For the uninitiated, silent ball is a game where students must remain silent while sitting on top of their desks, and they pass a ball around the room. Sparkle is a game where students have to spell a word together, so like one kid would say the first letter, the second kid the next letter, third kid says the next letter, etc. I had students sit on top of their desks and pass a ball around, but once a student caught the ball, they had to add the correct next letter to the word. If they got the letter wrong, they had to sit down. Fairly simple. Everyone was on board with it and was engaged in the game. Every teacher’s dream! I made it a point to write the word up on the board as they went along so they could keep track of what letters had already been said.

Conceptually, I support this goal. Practically, though, this has lead to a few weird situations that make me wonder about my next steps. Managers are now evaluated on DEI goals. I applied for an internal position on another team, but was told by that team’s manager that I wasn’t being considered because I (white cis straight man) would not increase the teams diversity on any dimension. Additionally, I’ve had several extremely qualified referrals ignored for the same reason. These referrals have proceeded to procure roles at various FAANG companies, so their skills are not in question. I will say that all of this has lead to a much more diverse team overall (albeit a very junior-heavy one). However, given that all this is being achieved with a very heavy thumb on the scale, I do wonder if this is the place for me longer term. I don’t think I would even be considered for an interview for my current role, and the DEI goals for the more senior roles make me wonder if I have “space” to be promoted. Has anyone encountered a similar environment before? What’s the best way forward as a completely non-“diverse” individual who has ambitions of achieving high-level technical leadership roles?

Maybe this is typical for mid-levels? They are asking for availability in a week’s time. I had loosely talked about wanting more time during my meeting with him, and he had said that generally “studying more than 2 weeks is overdoing it”.

My project has iterated through a few senior-leveled software engineers who I try to absorb as much as I’m able to. They all seem really experienced and bright but I’ve noticed a similar theme with the habits or mistakes my team members continue to make. The first similarity I’ve noticed is they all like to rush through their stories. This is made obvious by the amount of missed requirements or bugs that they continue to produce. There’s no thoroughness at all. They focus on architecting a clean solution, not a right solution. More bugs have been produced by my senior-leveled colleagues than features. Secondly they each like to try to either incorporate or enforce processes that they were accustomed to at their old place. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but their ideas tend to not take into consideration the small team size, deadlines and tight budget our product is in. I completely think management in my company has created an environment where efficiency is valued more than quality, so the development team was made to cut corners. My Senior-leveled colleagues all seem to hate it and push for change, but they only seem to be bumping heads with management. I’m still new in this field so I’ve personally haven’t experienced the affects of doing things one way or another, so I’ve yet to whiteness the disasters that they’ve seen.

Never did well in maths. Couldn’t tell you a binary tree from a depth first algorithm, but I write code that’s clear, effective, and efficient. I stumble upon working methods I guess. Today I had a phone screen with an equally large tech giant, and as is the standard now, it involved a live coding session. The challenge was pretty simple, easier than the ones I usually present in the 200+ interviews I’ve conducted in the past. The interviewer asked me to explain, before diving in, what my algorithm would be. I explained my approach and he asked me if it was [insert CS term here] approach.

She insisted that our conversation ""was not an interview"" but that she was just giving me intel about the atmosphere to help me make a decision.

However, the interviewer got back to me several days after she said she would and informed me that they decided to go with someone else. The whole experience left a bad tase in my mouth.

White criticised the UK’s education set-up and said that some of the 16 year olds at John Lewis did not have “functional literacy and numeracy” skills. She also warned that children who are less academically inclined are not always able to reach their full potential. “To have done ten years, 11, 12 years of education, and not having, in many cases, functional literacy, certainly, pretty typically not having functional numeracy beyond the age of, I’d say, ten, 11, means that they may then have fabulous people skills and fabulous skills in terms of operating in a team but that’s almost out with the education system,” White said. The Times Education Commission is currently examining the future of education in light of the Covid-19 crisis. It will also look at the decline in social mobility, as well as how technology can help improve education for children in the UK. Former Labour prime Minister Tony Blair, children’s laureate Cressida Cowell and director of the National Theatre Rufus Norris are among those giving evidence to the committee. The year-long commission is set to produce a final report in June 2022.

I recently dyed my hair blonde, and it took a lot for me to muster up the courage to not care about having blonde hair as an Asian-American. Of course, you see a bunch of Asian American women with a blonde balayage, and they look amazing with it.

I thought going blonde would help me feel more confident, but instead it makes me feel so weird about myself in public (especially when I am hanging out with my white friends). I have this perception that people think I am trying to be something I am not (""act white"") and that as an Asian American, I should stick to the darker hair colors. I know that so many non-white women can rock the blonde hair (I was inspired by yanyanchan on IG) and that wanting to be blonde does not stem from a desire to look Caucasian. The blonde color is just pretty (especially when you wear so much black clothing) and can spice up your hair. I was just wondering what everyone's views are on this. Have any of you guys regretted going blonde or felt weird about being a blonde when you aren't white?

She was very cold and matter of fact with me, and wasn’t very welcoming or understanding. Didn’t show any compassion when I told her my story. I even tried to hint at how hard it is to find the right doctor as a black woman and she didn’t really pick up on that. She did my Pap smear (didn’t warn me about the discomfort either) and then had her nurse tell me days later I had BV and needed to pick up a prescription that has since been giving me terrible nausea. Now I know not all black women are the same, and that maybe I shouldn’t have expected a grandmotherly experience just because we share skin color. But I just feel like given the context of this past year alone, the statistics around black women and reproductive health, and the fact that she’s the only black female obgyn in the area... like am I wrong to have wanted a little more warmth from her?

I was burnt out going into the job search, and only applied to 2 companies that I was sure would not be toxic (I am in tech so there are always jobs available and almost every well-known place there is reputation of a bro culture).

Promoted at small firm I was working with doing small business taxes/accounting. Firm paid for US CPA. I invested some money into a new office/ branch in US and managed new location. Left after 1 year because partner was just using me. Earning 36k USD at this point. Move to mid size firm for 6 months back in Canada. Making 48k USD now. Poached by big 4 pretty quickly. Spent 1 yr in big 4 as snr analyst doing niche tax work. Earning 64k USD. Great reviews and set to be promoted but I didn't think i was doing any value added work and felt confined to a niche. I had written my GMAT several years ago and the score was about to expire (700/800). It's a good score so i gave it a shot and applied to European B- schools. Didn't apply US schools cuz visa process is a pain and Canadian schools have very bad ROI. Got into a top school and sunk 110k USD into tuition. Had a blast at school, great memories. Recruited gaming, big tech, consulting, and random one off companies i thought were interesting. 1 offer each from consulting, big tech, and industry.

I've asked this in a Korean-American community(more than 99% of them are 1st generation immigrants who were born and raised in Korea) and they said this is not because of racism but because 1) Asian Americans prefer remaining as an engineer rather than becoming a manager 2) 1st generation immigrants tend to lack the adequate English and communication skills to climb the corporate ladder. If they try harder to assimilate by hosting parties at their houses and watch American footballs, hockey, and basketballs(instead of soccer) and go out hunting with his or her colleagues, they will not be discriminated against at all.

I applied to an analyst position at a registered investment advisor on LinkedIn and went through multiple rounds of Zoom interviews. They were supposedly interested in me because they then also asked me to take a 6-hour exam, which I then took. I didn't know if I did well on it or not, but then they also asked me to grab lunch with 4 directors and the chief investment officer. The lunch was pretty bizarre because I was this 25-year old Asian American woman eating with five Caucasian men who were all 35-60 years old. I struggled to insert myself into their conversations, which were 80% about their kids. I think I screwed up my chances after asking a question about their company's diversity initiatives - I was pretty concerned about potentially being on a team of 15 men (not to mention they were all Caucasian and extremely tall/attractive) and no women. After the lunch, HR emailed me to tell me that they would get back to me extremely soon. Well, a week went by and they didn't get back to me! I'd emailed one of the directors in the meantime to thank him for lunch but didn't get any information about next steps. Then I noticed that they'd recently posted an analyst position on LinkedIn (whether or not it was the same one as the one I'd interviewed for, I couldn't tell), and within 24 hours it'd gotten 200+ applications. I then applied to the company's newly posted job on LinkedIn just to alert them that I'm aware, and HR called me an hour later to tell me that I didn't get the job, but that I was being considered for this ""new"" job and that they'd throw my application into the mix.

And I spent about a month and a half after that trying to heal from the situation. I was burnt out going into the job search, and only applied to 2 companies that I was sure would not be toxic (I am in tech so there are always jobs available and almost every well-known place there is reputation of a bro culture).

I only had like 1 student who grinded my nerves really bad. Admin is great in terms of support and letting me have freedom. Last two weeks have been fucking hell. Homecoming week was a disaster. Fights every day, TPing every night. And not just TPing, which I'm personally fine with, but going in groups of 100 students, yelling and swearing into teachers houses and the houses of their neighbors. Going in long trains of vehicles, running lights/stop signs. And then on Friday, in another teacher's class my FFA president turned around to an African American student and told her to turn that N-word music off. Teacher was not in the room but it was caught in a tik-tok. So, after consulting other ag teachers and my admin, I met with the mom and kid and said he could either step down from the officer team or be removed from FFA. My Constitution doesn't allow me to remove from the officer team, but I can revoke membership so I had to do that workaround. Mom flipped me off with the principal sitting right there and has sent 2 nasty emails to me/admin. Not even at me, complaining about admin and the former ag teacher. And it hit me, this is probably the first time there's been an actual consequence for something like this. Last week a group of football players was taken to the police station and they all played homecoming. This kid didn't even get hit with a suspension or anything. Now I'm avoiding going out in this small town because I don't want any contact/confrontation with the family unless admin is present. No accountability, no consequences until me. Ridiculous.

Spent 1 yr in big 4 as snr analyst doing niche tax work. Earning 64k USD. Great reviews and set to be promoted but I didn't think i was doing any value added work and felt confined to a niche.

Didn't apply US schools cuz visa process is a pain and Canadian schools have very bad ROI. Got into a top school and sunk 110k USD into tuition. Had a blast at school, great memories. Recruited gaming, big tech, consulting, and random one off companies i thought were interesting. 1 offer each from consulting, big tech, and industry. Chose industry because pay was great, in a location i preferred. Now living in an Asian city, earning 150k USD but the money goes quite far because my expenses are low.

I would like to start with saying that right now I am at a bit of a crossroad and have no clue on how to tackle and proceed with the situation. I sent out applications to two places, and got positive feedback for both, with somewhat similar offers in terms of compensation packages. So my issue at hand comes from the fact that it might be a career choice. So my first offer is close to a sidegrade, or at most a slight upgrade in terms of what I do right now. Senior audit associate in one of the top 6 companies, and the second one is Internal auditor in industry. I should probably mention that I am based in Eastern Europe, and so the Internal auditor role is more so for the entire European region for the company, with me being directly under the Manager of the department. With the senior audit associate I will be pretty much doing what I am doing now, and might gain some more insight and different methodology. Whilst the internal auditor role comes with SOX testing, which is something completely new for me, and unfortunately haven't looked too much into it and what it's comprised of. I am not sure, if I want to pursue a career in CPA, which is why I am finding it hard to make a choice between the two. My thought process right now is that, by taking up the internal auditor offer I will be exposed to new stuff like SOX and networking with people outside my country, but at the same time it might be like a dead end with no further prospects in the future. The senior auditor role has the networking aspect as well, but in the country.

reddit_3531,"Opinions On Ethnic Women Having Blonde Hair So, here's the situation. I recently dyed my hair blonde, and it took a lot for me to muster up the courage to not care about having blonde hair as an Asian-American. Of course, you see a bunch of Asian American women with a blonde balayage, and they look amazing with it. I have had light brown hair for over a year, and I just really felt inclined to switch it up late last year because I needed a fresh new start (things ended badly with the guy I was dating). I thought going blonde would help me feel more confident, but instead it makes me feel so weird about myself in public (especially when I am hanging out with my white friends). I have this perception that people think I am trying to be something I am not (""act white"") and that as an Asian American, I should stick to the darker hair colors. I know that so many non-white women can rock the blonde hair (I was inspired by yanyanchan on IG) and that wanting to be blonde does not stem from a desire to look Caucasian. The blonde color is just pretty (especially when you wear so much black clothing) and can spice up your hair. I was just wondering what everyone's views are on this. Have any of you guys regretted going blonde or felt weird about being a blonde when you aren't white? I spent hundreds of dollars to go blonde, and now that I am, I feel like I should just go back to the salon and dye it brown/black again. I hate that I feel like this, but I've spent way too much time thinking about my hair. Even though my hair looks great and that I still think I look pretty, I just feel weirdly judged when I see people look at me in public.",reddit,covid_era,2021,race_authority,['man'],"['black', 'white', 'asian', 'american', 'brown']",[],['judge'],NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL,0.6589114665985107,0.9937669038772583,0.44332510232925415,0.9789196310935442

reddit_3550,"Motherhood as a conservative oppressive ideology used to keep women under control I am currently running a Kickstarter campaign to finance the publication of my photo book ""Undo Motherhood"". It explores the reasons why a significant number of women around the world today regret becoming mothers and points a finger at the patriarchal institution of motherhood, which from a very young age pushes women to become mothers, promising the utmost fulfilment and happiness, and then abandons them, very often at the cost of their lives. The women in this project come from seven different countries. They all love their children and are excellent mothers when judged according to society’s standards, and yet they hate the oppressive mother role that robbed them of their own existence and suffer through it in silence, feeling it to be the worst mistake they have made. As a mother myself, I totally agree with the American writer and feminist of the 70s Adrienne Rich. She said that as much as motherhood means a love-based bond with your child, it is at the same time a conservative oppressive ideology with its rigid codex of moral rules that prescribe how you must feel, think, and behave as a mother. In my opinion, it is a perfect invisible and often internalized mechanism to keep women under control in care-giving subservient roles. With this project I hope to help other people to make informed decisions and contribute to the public discussion about gender roles and power structures in families and society.

reddit_3585,"What to do with life? This is a bit of a weird question but it feels right to ask it here first. For context I am still young, just graduated university, and landed a very good starting offer at a highly sought-after tech company. I have a new sense of stability - I am not constantly worried about doing Leetcode or applying to companies, I don't have to constantly read the news hunting for a new prestigious startup I could be working for, I'm not obsessively scrolling through Linkedin for a potential opportunity and the list goes on. Overall - I no longer am doing a lot of the tiring and time-consuming things I was trying to get that ""goal"" offer. The problem? I feel empty almost. It's been weird trying to affirm to myself that this newfound free time I spend on myself isn't being wasted but I'm slowly acclimating. I've hit that ""target"" I've had since middle school and I'm sorta lost now. What do I fill my time with? (Both technically with new things to learn to progress my career and personal life things) First - What is the next step of technical learning to progress my career? I want to grow as a technical developer, maybe become a principal developer in a few years ... reach a CTO level position, and either run development at a company or leave and join a startup as a CTO/Founding Developer (something like that). What do I start doing to hit that goat? I've seen people say to start with AWS Cloud Practioner, Systems Design, Distributed Systems but insight from experienced people would be great. Second - What are new things I can do for fun? I do have hobbies currently: I like sports, love to cook, enjoy a wide variety of TV Media from American to Japanese and Korean. What new things can I explore? I also hope this post can help other students but STEM ones particularly.

There's little buy in to the educational process, parents are often hostile to anything school personel do and the kids themselves are apathetic about the whole ball of wax. And honestly, there is precious little that a school system can do if a kid has no buy in to hold them accountable. I really don't believe in suspensions and the like unless safety is a factor. And that tends to be go to for many schools. Veteran teachers I talk to, say they noticed something about 5 to 10 years ago and its been a downward slide ever since. I have no idea how many kids I've seen with diagnosed conduct disorders but it seems WAY more than 5 years ago.

The teams seems lovely but that company has a weird reputation about extra working hours and less flexibility (different culture, it's chinese). Though close people told me only good things about it. (note:it was them approaching me for the role) My therapist tells me my current job seems toxic and i have a bit of a masochist syndrome and also afraid to take risks.

Made manager through hard work but decided during COVID this job isn't for me in the long term. Was about to leave a while back, applied to a few jobs half-heartedly but didn't really get much traction in tech. Realized lots of jobs either wouldn't sponsor visas / might sponsor but do not give guarantees (non American here with my US visa attached to my MBB) so I decided to remain until immigration gets sorted out. I plan on applying again and preparing by end of year or Q1 2022 - but worried that it would be tough for me to sell myself to FAANG and fintech. Would sincerely appreciate some pointers and advice from people who made the jump / close to making the jump on how to best position/prepare For context 1. I'm targeting S&O, bizops, program management, business development, corp strat roles 2. I don't have a tech background, only business background. Went to school outside the US so no Ivy league/M7 branding. 3. 2-3 YOE pre MBA in finance, 4-5 years MBB experience by time I'll apply.

reddit_3657,Harassment at Work My Cousin (early 30s) was recently at her job by this older white guy (mid 50s). Mostly white workplace yet a few black coworkers she befriended and they come to her since she’s intelligent and people come to her type of way. Most of the times he would be the one to approach her to talk and gossip and at first it seemed like just talking with your coworkers. Then it became off as with how he tried to bring up discuss racial discussions. He said to not consider Black Americans her people (from Virgin Islands). Which was not his place to even say. He told her everyone has gone through things as he was Catholic and they were discriminated in the past. He said in his own country he’s discriminated (although not even a recent immigrant...) The breaking point was trying to address her as “my girl” and saying “my wife at work”. He would also turn conversations sexual... She began ignoring him and distancing herself from him and then he approached her asking why she’s not talking to him.. She yelled at him to go. She reported it to her manager and she designed her schedule so he wouldn’t have to come into contact with him. Though the manager was saying “Really?” as if he wouldn’t approach her sexually when she said what he said to her. The manager even said Italians can be that way(?) and it may be a cultural thing. Like his parents may be immigrants why is that even a reflection off of him? And it’s Italian culture to overstep boundaries? I’m so mad I literally want to confront that man myself. Her assistant manager never even said I’m sorry that happened to you or even addressed it like she doesnt gaf about her workers. The guy would even mess with this black guy at the job and deal with him differently. I feel like black women can be sexually harassed and no one would believe us because apparently no one want us.

I've asked this in a Korean-American community(more than 99% of them are 1st generation immigrants who were born and raised in Korea) and they said this is not because of racism but because 1) Asian Americans prefer remaining as an engineer rather than becoming a manager 2) 1st generation immigrants tend to lack the adequate English and communication skills to climb the corporate ladder. If they try harder to assimilate by hosting parties at their houses and watch American footballs, hockey, and basketballs(instead of soccer) and go out hunting with his or her colleagues, they will not be discriminated against at all. Also, he mentioned that Asian Americans born and raised in America do not face any institutional discrimination other than affirmative action because they understand American culture and are good with English. &#x200B; Do you agree with these opinions?

reddit_3666,"Male names face discrimination in hiring A report we created took together evidence and found that men generally face higher rates of discrimination in hiring when it comes to male vs. female names \[1\]. Here are the research highlights: A male name is 13% less likely to be chosen than a female name for rental housing, and it goes as big of an anti-male gender gap as 33% in low-population areas for black male names vs. black female names (46% callback rate for men, and 79% callback rate for women) and male Muslim names are 50% less likely to be housed than female Muslim names. Comparatively, male names are less likely to be hired in female dominated jobs, and are 3.2% less likely to be hired than in blind hiring (vs. the 2.9% advantage women have). One study found that women were hired 2% less based off of their name, but it appeared to be biased, due to the fact that it only used 9 names and did not differentiate between lower class and higher class names. (If you look at the study you'll find that a male name, Jose Vazquez, had the highest negative response rate \[13%\] and nearly the lowest positive response rate \[81%\]. \[2\]) Female names are also possibly discriminated against in male-dominated jobs, as it depends on the job, for example a heavy-lifting job may be biased against them, but a STEM one is not (as they are biased towards 2:1 over EQUALLY or SLIGHTLY MORE qualified male candidates \[3\]). \[1\] Adams, Drew K.

reddit_3668,"Pros/Cons of transitioning from FTE to Contactor I was laid off my FTE job last December after 10 years (VERY LARGE American telecom firm) due to a reduction in force.

I asked them about benefits and whatnot and they said ""ask the contracting firm"", indeed tells me these benefits are crap and you dont get paid for days off, no 401k match, etc. I asked them about ""exclusivity"" (ie i can work another contract at the same time) and they said no. To me it sounds like they want me back as an employee with all the loyalty that comes with it but are not giving it back. Also, the contract is year to year and I have to get a renewal with them each year. So with that whats the pros/cons with going back to my old job this way?

I applied to an analyst position at a registered investment advisor on LinkedIn and went through multiple rounds of Zoom interviews. They were supposedly interested in me because they then also asked me to take a 6-hour exam, which I then took. I didn't know if I did well on it or not, but then they also asked me to grab lunch with 4 directors and the chief investment officer. The lunch was pretty bizarre because I was this 25-year old Asian American woman eating with five Caucasian men who were all 35-60 years old. I struggled to insert myself into their conversations, which were 80% about their kids. I think I screwed up my chances after asking a question about their company's diversity initiatives - I was pretty concerned about potentially being on a team of 15 men (not to mention they were all Caucasian and extremely tall/attractive) and no women. After the lunch, HR emailed me to tell me that they would get back to me extremely soon. Well, a week went by and they didn't get back to me!

See Below: [Wang & Dennison \[2009\] FamCA 206]( This is a case of an Anglo-Australian father and a Chinese-born mother. After separation, the mother and father lived in separate states. They had two children aged 11 and 9. The father had then re-partnered. In dispute over 'contact with the children' after separation, the mother made allegations of child sexual abuse against the father. She also made allegations of physical violence by the father against her and the children. These allegations were found to be baseless, contrived and pre-meditated by the Court. The mother also engaged in behaviour intended to incite hatred in the children against the father. This alienation proceeded to a degree where the children did not want to spend time with the father and had threatened self-harm if forced to do so. The Court had concluded that the mother presented as a deceptive and unreliable witness, who was unrelenting in her ""alienating"" behaviour towards the children against the father, equating to significant family violence. The Outcome His Honour ordered equal shared parental responsibility, but that the children live with the mother and spend no time with the father. However, the Judge ordered a ""post orders program"", as recommended by the supervising family consultant with a view to the girls, being reunited with their father as soon as practicable.

Yesterday i got a job offer from another big (yet a bit new) tech company, more money, better title. The role is nice but definitely not my ideal next career step. The teams seems lovely but that company has a weird reputation about extra working hours and less flexibility (different culture, it's chinese). Though close people told me only good things about it. (note:it was them approaching me for the role) My therapist tells me my current job seems toxic and i have a bit of a masochist syndrome and also afraid to take risks.

He said a few kids raised their hands, he raised his too. The teacher asked them what they knew, then she asked my son. He said ""The only spanish i know is from watching George Lopez"" (It came on Nickelodeon all the time when he was growing up). He said it got a laugh out of the class, but i guess the teacher took offense to it. That's what he told me. They laughed, he said some quotes from the show. (I Got This and Oh, Que La) Because recently, i got called in by the principal, the spanish teacher reported him because it was a ""racist joke"".

I recently dyed my hair blonde, and it took a lot for me to muster up the courage to not care about having blonde hair as an Asian-American. Of course, you see a bunch of Asian American women with a blonde balayage, and they look amazing with it. I have had light brown hair for over a year, and I just really felt inclined to switch it up late last year because I needed a fresh new start (things ended badly with the guy I was dating). I thought going blonde would help me feel more confident, but instead it makes me feel so weird about myself in public (especially when I am hanging out with my white friends). I have this perception that people think I am trying to be something I am not (""act white"") and that as an Asian American, I should stick to the darker hair colors. I know that so many non-white women can rock the blonde hair (I was inspired by yanyanchan on IG) and that wanting to be blonde does not stem from a desire to look Caucasian. The blonde color is just pretty (especially when you wear so much black clothing) and can spice up your hair. I was just wondering what everyone's views are on this. Have any of you guys regretted going blonde or felt weird about being a blonde when you aren't white? I spent hundreds of dollars to go blonde, and now that I am, I feel like I should just go back to the salon and dye it brown/black again.

He didn't use the term 'woke' but it seems like that line of argument has got through to him.

I read through a thread where the poster was asking about the scope of practice for GPs that have done Obs and Gynae training as part of their GP training and they're talking about doing C sections?! Here in the UK, the division is clear. Finish your three years of GP training (usually one surgical job, one medical job (any specialty - cardio / resp / gastro / gerries / acute med), one paeds job and an obs and gynae job, maybe with ED or psych thrown in) and you're a GP that works almost exclusively in the community. On instagram (I know, I know...), some of the doctors I follow talk about admitting patients to the hospital and then doing ward rounds on them as part of their practice - this could never happen in the UK. When the patient is admitted, your input ends and you hand over care to the hospital team. After they're discharged, they're essentially 'handed back' to you - but you don't get any input on their hospital management, just as the hospital doctors won't have any input on their community management (to an extent). Some GPs will do locum shifts in their local ED, and some develop a 'Special Interest' - eg GP with Derm or GP with Obs and Gynae, but they'd be doing things like managing chronic skin conditions or putting in coils - I don't think a GP would ever do a section here, unless super super rural.

I quickly got dismissed by the PAs and Residents until 4pm when they realized there was no output the whole shift and ordered a CT scan which actually showed I was correct.

I'm currently contracted with a large pharmacy chain to vaccinate staff and residents of long term care clinics. We travel to many small clinics around the city administering the Pfizer vaccine. Originally I was trained that reconstituted partially used vials are good for up to 6 hours if kept in our travel cooler, so we would mark the remaining doses, and use them at the next clinic. However about a week ago I was told by the manager of our districts project that we are no longer allowed to do this, and that this change was coming from Pfizer, not our company. Later I was told by another employee that there's no way this policy was coming from Pfizer and that it was coming from our company. I cannot find any information online regarding this change in reconstituted vaccine storage. The CDC's website currently states: ""Keep mixed vaccine between 2⁰C and 25⁰C (36⁰F and 77⁰F) and administer within 6 hours. Discard any unused vaccine after 6 hours. Do not return to freezer storage."" I am now being told that a vial that has been reconstituted is supposedly only good for only 1 hour, and cannot be used at the next clinic, even if less than an hours time has passed. There are 6 doses to a vial, and often times we visit clinics with a number of people that is not a multiple of 6, leaving up to 5 doses of reconstituted vaccine leftover in a vial. Yesterday the small team I was on traveled to multiple clinics, administered about 75 vaccines, and were forced to waste 15 doses. Some days it's more. This is just on one team of many working all over the country for this large pharmacy chain. If everyone is following the same policy then the amount of waste is absolutely staggering.

It is a government role. Recently, elected officials amysteriously got rid of our county manager. They also placed another official on leave. No reasons given. They appointed an interim county manager who is just awful. He is rude, demoralizing, and throws staff under the bus at any given chance to save face. He is not a manager...no management experience. They just named him permanent for the role despite not reviewing any other candidates. My job frequently involves politics but this is just out of hand lately. My supervisor is the best but is actively job hunting. I know he will leave once he finds a good opportunity. When he leaves, I will be in his position and have to deal with the brunt of new management.

Unfortunately, our insurance changed and I had to find yet another doctor. Yesterday was my first appointment and he was so horrible. This man instantly hated I was on an infusion and said I needed to be on methotrexate. I told him that the arthritis in my jaws was getting worse at the beginning of my appointment. He used this as some kind of disgusting ammunition to get me to go back on methotrexate by saying, ""It'll make your husband very sad if you can't use your jaws.""

In a move that would make the Smoking Man proud, House Republicans in Louisiana have decided that the best way to save money is to cut funding for education and pay off public employee retirement debt instead.

I desperately need a radical transformation for my job. I'm willing to put in tons of hours and break my back and take training, but I have a wife and kid to feed and house at the same time. Ive considered getting a cdl, but that costs $3500 for training and I really don't want to leave my family for weeks at a time or sell myself to a company for two years to get free training. I am willing to though, if that's what it takes. Im hoping someone could drop an idea that will fit my situation. Again, if I could work 11 hour days just to make alot, I'd be willing to do that. I'm not good in the sun. I get heat stroke easily. I'm fairly smart and I think I could have become a doctor or something if my parents had encouraged me to get educated. I'm 31 now.

They now LITERALLY count a woman who CALLS an ex and TELLS them ""Im gonna kill myself in an hour unless you come here and get back with me"" a SUICIDE attempt, even if she just ends up taking seven over the counter painkillers, then walking to a hospital and telling a doctor what she did. THAT. IS. NOT. SUICIDE. A man picking up a shotgun in the woods and blowing his head off, alone, is a suicide. A man jumping off a twenty story bridge suddenly is a suicide. A man gassing himself in his car is a suicide. Men have a HIGH association of doing these things-no warning, no fucking around, DEATH. Women have a high association of EMOTIONAL MANIPULATION and ATTENTION SEEKING behaviours-which NOBODY in their right mind could compare with SUICIDES. But now feminism has poisoned everywhere and everything, and because feminists HATE the unavoidable FACT that men have it worse and so kill themselves in shocking numbers, they have been DESPERATE to change the DEFINITION of what counts as ""suicide attempts"".

Man: Dies Woman: Wants to die for 30 years, talks to over 100 therapists about it and thus ends up overcoming her suicidal ideation at age 50 and goes on to live to 100, enjoying 50 years of a joyful and meaningful life. The entire field of Psychology: Well, we know the woman was suicidal. Look at the depth of insight we have into her mind from 30 years of therapy! She felt SO open to talk about her feelings and we helped her SO much! Unfortunately though, she did attempt suicide twice. Granted, it's not like she shot herself in the head and got lucky and survive it. On the first one, she told ER doctors that she took a few pills and felt like her life was meaningless, and the other time she felt really REALLY bad about a break up. I mean she felt REALLY REALLY REALLY bad. In fact, she was convinced that she was dying from it! She INSISTED that both of these experiences were bona fide suicide attempts. So yea she definitely checked ALL of our boxes. Poor lady. THIRTY YEARS she went through this! On the other hand, the man committed suicide at age 18 without ever even trying therapy, and so we actually no longer have any record that he ever existed in the first place.

TLDR: loved the intro but hated the sexist ending, is that redeemed in the 2nd book? I just read Helene Wecker's first book, The Golem and the Jinni. The first 4/5 was a fun romp of two different supernatural beings exploring their new lives. I love slice-of-life epics, especially when they're leavened by something extraordinary. The book's conclusion explains that entire premise is centered around a feckless male Jinni. He's basically a fuckboy, arrogant and mean as a wasp. He plays with poor tribespeople, seduces women, destroys their lives, starts the book's entire circumstance waterfall, pisses everyone off, endangers a bunch of people, hurts a lot of folks in unforgivable ways, never learns empathy or kindness or sympathy or love, then when he tries to suicide everyone drops what they're doing to save him for no reason I can find. His personality is somewhere between insufferable ass and outrageously destructive fuckboy. That's it. That's the book's premise. It's centered around an irredeemable man and his penis. The golem in the title is basically Wonder Woman: bright, kind, thoughtful, strong, indefatigable, indestructible, self-sufficient, reads minds, speaks all languages, can learn anything, etc etc etc. Probably could be a polymath, detective, diplomat, scientist, doctor, therapist, explorer, or anything else she put her mind to. However at the end of the book, she chooses to live an extremely constricted life as a (swearword) baker's helper, re-bound to serve a man and his emotional needs. What a waste.

When we first met, I fingerspelled my name into the palm of his hand, and he reached out and touched my face to create a mental map of the landmarks and contours (e.g. my glasses, the shape of my chin, my cheekbones). Then he fingerspelled my name back to me. The rest of the night, each time I went to his room I would tap his shoulder, he would reach out for my face and confirm it was me then sign my name. Whenever I explained our interventions or asked him a question, he would have his hands over mine so he could feel the shapes my hands made. It was truly the most profound moment of human connection I've ever experienced, and something I think about a lot.

reddit_4266,"Louisiana House Republicans Cut Education Funding to Pay Off Retirement Debt – Who Needs Teachers Anyway? In a move that would make the Smoking Man proud, House Republicans in Louisiana have decided that the best way to save money is to cut funding for education and pay off public employee retirement debt instead. If you were wondering why Louisiana ranks 50th in education, wonder no more. House Republicans have finally found a solution to the state's education woes – just get rid of the teachers! Who needs qualified educators when you can have unqualified volunteers running the classrooms? It's like they say, if you can read this, thank a teacher. If you can't, thank a Louisiana House Republican. But why stop at eliminating teacher pay raises? Why not just eliminate teachers altogether? After all, it's not like we need educated citizens to run our state or anything. Who needs critical thinking skills, scientific literacy, or an understanding of history when you can just Google everything, right? Of course, we can't forget about the children. They may not be old enough to vote or make campaign contributions, but they can sure be a nuisance with all their learning and growing and stuff. So why not just cut early childhood education programs too? Who needs to invest in our future when we can just pay off debt? But don't worry, it's not all doom and gloom. House Republicans have graciously decided to retain university faculty pay raises. Because, you know, it's not like we need educated college graduates to enter the workforce or anything. Who needs doctors, lawyers, engineers, or scientists when you can just have uneducated politicians running the show?

It would be my first job ever if I’m called in for an interview and get the job. (A lot of people say getting hired at warehouses are relatively easy, even if you have no work experience like me). I’m personally excited. The job description said picking, packing, shipping, moving goods, and cleaning. And as far as I’ve heard about warehouse jobs, I think it fits me. I like moving around as I’m I’m very hyper, paying attention to detail is something I do constantly cause of my OCD tendencies, I’m kinda stupid in real life so repetitive and simple tasks are all I’m really good at, I’m out of shape as I need to get rid of some man meat, and I’ve noticed that when I’m working most efficiently is when I’m by myself. I don’t hate people, it’s just that dealing with them consistently causes too much stress and anxiety that hinders me from working the best I can for my teachers or whoever. I also find the overtime chances intriguing because I have online classes and no social life anyways. My biggest concerns are adjusting to the weights I’m probably going to deal with, and just getting comfortable with everything there. Where everything is, this task, that task, this co-worker, that co-worker, etc. Both concerns could get better in time though. Honestly, the pay is one of the last things I considered. It’s good enough for me and the job is only 11 minutes away which is convenient. I just wanted to know if anybody has worked at one of their warehouses? If so I’d like some incite, advice, tips, etc. If you don’t/haven’t worked there but have worked at a warehouse in general, that also counts and I could use that incite, advice, tips, and etc as well cause I’m sure they are all similar in enough ways.

An adult women took advantage of a minor and otherwise reasonable people seem to be determined to paint the child she raped as the likely perpetrator. Frankly, do better.

There was an internet discussion brought up a while back that stemmed from Jess Hilarious proudly proclaiming that she doesn't support black owned businesses due to unprofessionalism.

We worked out a plea agreement which included a suspended year of jail time and a 30 year criminal order of protection. If he gets arrested for any reason he will have to serve that year of time.

reddit_4413,"Charged misdemeanor assault pled down to 4th degree misdemeanor aggravated disorderly conduct Hi, over a year ago I was at a bar with friends. I noticed a man being physical with a woman and me being the person I am, always trying to make sure everyone is okay, checked to see if the girl was alright. The man got angry, told me to mind my business, pushed and spit on me. I open hand hit him off me. This happened as a police officer was approaching. I was never arrested. I was wrote a ticket for M1assault. Later in court, they gave me a plea deal and said they would let me off with M4 aggravated disorderly conduct if I plead guilty to that. I did, to avoid going to trial. I had no jail time, just a small fine and an anger management course. I’ve never been in trouble before. I have a bachelors degree from a competitive university and have worked hard to get to where I am, however it seems as if one mistake has ruined my life. The past year, I’ve done a lot of reflection and have decided that I care for others health and safety deeply. I want to make an impact on someone’s life. I want to be a nurse…. Will my misdemeanor aggravated disorderly conduct stop me? I’m in Ohio. I contacted the board and they told me they can’t give me an answer until I submit an application. I’m just so drained because of this. I feel like my life is ruined. I have the opportunity for expungement soon with a lawyer, however I know it will still show up on my background check.

reddit_4417,"Louisiana House Republicans Cut Education Funding to Pay Off Retirement Debt – Who Needs Teachers Anyway? In a move that would make the Smoking Man proud, House Republicans in Louisiana have decided that the best way to save money is to cut funding for education and pay off public employee retirement debt instead. If you were wondering why Louisiana ranks 50th in education, wonder no more. House Republicans have finally found a solution to the state's education woes – just get rid of the teachers! Who needs qualified educators when you can have unqualified volunteers running the classrooms? It's like they say, if you can read this, thank a teacher. If you can't, thank a Louisiana House Republican. But why stop at eliminating teacher pay raises? Why not just eliminate teachers altogether? After all, it's not like we need educated citizens to run our state or anything. Who needs critical thinking skills, scientific literacy, or an understanding of history when you can just Google everything, right? Of course, we can't forget about the children. They may not be old enough to vote or make campaign contributions, but they can sure be a nuisance with all their learning and growing and stuff. So why not just cut early childhood education programs too? Who needs to invest in our future when we can just pay off debt? But don't worry, it's not all doom and gloom. House Republicans have graciously decided to retain university faculty pay raises. Because, you know, it's not like we need educated college graduates to enter the workforce or anything. Who needs doctors, lawyers, engineers, or scientists when you can just have uneducated politicians running the show? In conclusion, the Louisiana House budget plan is a perfect example of why we need to elect officials who prioritize education and invest in our future.

The issue isn't whether I'm capable of finishing out (I've done pretty well in the face of immense trauma to be honest), it's whether I even want to anymore. And my big question is: is any of this worth it? Did anyone here have a truly awful time at law school that now has a job that pays decently without giving up your entire life? I don't need $200k a year here. I'm fine starting out at $75k and moving up. But if the profession is anything like the education, I imagine I will end my career with a revolver in my mouth.

My wife is from India and has a master's degree in history from a well-respected Indian university. We moved to America several months ago, and she's applying for a variety of positions--some in her field, and some in generic university administration positions. She's made it to final-stage interviews in positions that pay between $30,000 and $90,000 per year. However, she's only received concrete offers from jobs that pay between $30,000 and $40,000 per year. Earlier today, for instance, she received an offer for a university administrative position that pays $30,000 per year. It includes full medical benefits and a surprisingly large 403(b) contribution. While she's eager to start working, I'm not sure what our expectations for a ""reasonable"" salary should be. I understand that my wife's foreign credential could pose an initial barrier to entry, but man... I was just in Subway the other day, and I saw that starting salaries for ""sandwich artists"" pay more per hour than her current offer. I get that history degrees aren't exactly in-demand, but it seems like even very, very relevant positions that require a master's and are located in high COL areas, like Washington, D.C., only pay between $40,000 and $50,000. We're sort of considering just taking this offer, since my wife's probably just going to go back to school next year to get a second master's.

She was a young wife and mother, single GSW through and through the neck at cricoid level. I'm not going to relate the whole case, suffice it to say the patient was awake, talking and neurologically intact on arrival, hemodynamically stable with no hard signs of vascular injury, and showed definitive signs of airway compromise ie diffuse surgical emphysema, air leak from the bullet tract, stridor, hypoxic distress (SaO2 84%) and a pool of blood in the pharynx. Initial blood gas was fairly decent with normal pCO2, mild metabolic acidosis and lactate of 4.0. Following a brief call to my attending, I moved quickly with rapid sequence intubation, but I was forced to bag after induction to prevent worsening hypoxia. There was blood everywhere and the anatomy was severely distorted, but I managed to get chest rise and breath sounds post intubation. Despite this SaO2 never recovered beyond 80% and then fell fast. Cardiac arrest followed; CPR was done but was ultimately futile. I've done some reading and discovered that conventional RSI can be disastrous with airway injuries. Seeing as there was a clear air leak close to the airway I should have kept the patient awake and inserted a tracheostomy tube directly into the tract and inflated the cuff distal to the injury. Suction would have taken care of any aspirated blood and I would have bought the patient enough time to get to theatre. I don't know why my attending did not tell me to secure the airway this way.

reddit_4502,"Metronidazole and vaping. I’m a doctor practicing in Europe, and just wanted to put forward a couple of minor cases I had in the ER last night for, well, I guess “input”? First is a young woman, 20s, who presented with what she thought was a severe allergic reaction to metronidazole, which she had been prescribed a few days prior for a tooth infection. Complaints were sudden onset vomiting, sweating, tachycardia, “feeling of impending doom” as quoted by herself. Now, the reason I put forward this case is; she apologised after I entered the room, as the first time I tried to make contact she had popped outside for a quick vape. When taking history, I asked her if she had a bottle of vape liquid I could look at, and she in fact did. The first ingredient was propylene glycol at 60%. Bingo, I thought. Metronidazole is known to cause these symptoms when combined with alcohol/propylene glycol. But then I thought, is the route of administration really sufficient to cause this reaction? I nevertheless told her to refrain from vaping for 48 hours if she could, and prescribed a different antibiotics, and she was discharged. But this had me wonder, given how many people vape nowadays — is the correlation enough to ask patients “vape status” before prescribing metronidazole? Has anyone else had similar encounters?

reddit_4510,"Should i feel bad for filing a complaint against a male NP? So I (F23) recently just started a new job in the emergency department and work closely with PA’s, NP’s and doctors. After seeing one of the patients, her complaint was female anatomy related, The NP (M50) had given her a breast exam (with her breast fully exposed) to further evaluate her complaint. (Not to mention, I have chaperoned several female exams and before his comments, this particular exam made me cringe, I could definitely see his enjoyment). Once the patient left the room, he made several comments to me about the largeness of her breast/implants and then said that he was “jealous of the attending doing the CT scan because he got to touch and squeeze them”. Which really didn’t make sense to me considering you don’t touch someone during a CT, but I would rather not revisit the subject to clarify. Not only as a woman with a larger chest, but this supposed-to-be professional healthcare worker, sexualizing a patient, did not sit well with me. I spoke with a few of my co-workers to see if I was overreacting and they all said I should file a complaint, because my thought process is, if I was that patient and being sexualized by a provider, I would want someone to advocate for me too. Might I add, I have NEVER gotten an unprofessional or creepy vibe from any one of the physicians I have worked with, but when I worked with this man, It felt like I had a wrench in my stomach, to the point of not feeling safe going anywhere alone with him.

reddit_4518,"Need advice about sketchy practices of a rural hospital So I just recently started working in the outpatient surgery center of a small rural hospital that is supposedly up and coming. Everything has been okay so far- I am enjoying the smaller patient case load and more relaxed atmosphere. However today a situation came up that rubbed me the wrong way and made me question how long I would stay at this hospital. An elderly woman came in for a total shoulder procedure that usually for her age and risk factors she would be expected to stay overnight for observation. However, the surgeon said no she can go home today. This surgeon has been known to send people home that should stay at the hospital for observation and WILL NOT change his mind. So after the procedure she is in PACU and not recovering well. Her vitals are fine but after 2 hours she still cannot wake up and is delirious. She also cannot void in the bedside commode (which was an ordeal to get her on), and it was discovered that she did not have a good support system at home to care for her. Despite all of this, the surgeon still said no to her staying. We escalated the situation to the DON and she sided with the doctor without even seeing the patient. Even the surgeons NP seemed uncomfortable with her going home. So the patient is not able to safely discharge home but we don’t have a choice but to discharge her because no one will admit her to the hospital. My concern is if she has a bad outcome at home, who does this fall on? The nurses discharged her but it’s not like they had another choice.

In addition, I would love the opportunity to educate the other adults (and even my students!) about what being an adult woman with autism is like, as a lot of them hear “autism” and expect to see someone with pretty high support needs like a lot of diagnosed students. I am thinking about offering to lead a PD day on this topic. Does that seem strange to offer? Many thanks for the insight!

reddit_4544,"Do you hesitate to report issues with other black women when you know their supervisor is white? I ask because I recently visited a new doctor(white) and her nurse(black) left a bad taste in my mouth during our short interaction. First off instead of trying to say my name she just called out to the waiting room for ""the lady"" to come up. Now my name isn't ""lady"" so I was confused as to what's going on and thought she couldn't be talking about me but sure enough she was. Then later on when she was doing preliminary intake stuff she was very curt which I didn't care too much about until she was being very pushy, rude, and tactless about asking if I was depressed. It was honestly just weird and I know I was looking at her like wtf so she curtly responded ""it's just a page I have to get through"" before leaving. I had a friend with me and after the nurse left they were also kinda baffled by how weird she was. Later on when I saw the doctor she also asked about depression but she did it in such a kind and compassionate way that it made the nurses questioning seem even worse. For the record I'm not planning to make a fuss over this because everyone has off days but it got me wondering what I'd do if my future interactions with this nurse became worse.

Most of the employees are nurses or other techs, but they are older than me. Some closer to my parents’ ages. My coworkers know my mother because she’s a nurse there, too, but she works PRN for now. So here’s the thing: My coworkers tease me every shift about how I am not like her. They say that she’s more “animated,” she “opened up” on her first day of work, and other things like that. They say I am too “quiet” and “timid” to be her daughter and to be a nurse, which is BS because we’re both introverts. Plus, they only know the woman they work with. The difference is that she been at her job longer, and she’s closer to their ages. I’ve been working for two months. When I go to work, I just want to do my job then leave. I make small talk if I find the conversation interesting, but I don’t share my personal life with anyone. I only talk if it’s something important or interesting.

I have been pointing this out for literally YEARS now but people STILL fall for their trick, just as they do for the wage gap myth. They now LITERALLY count a woman who CALLS an ex and TELLS them ""Im gonna kill myself in an hour unless you come here and get back with me"" a SUICIDE attempt, even if she just ends up taking seven over the counter painkillers, then walking to a hospital and telling a doctor what she did. THAT. IS. NOT. SUICIDE. A man picking up a shotgun in the woods and blowing his head off, alone, is a suicide. A man jumping off a twenty story bridge suddenly is a suicide. A man gassing himself in his car is a suicide. Men have a HIGH association of doing these things-no warning, no fucking around, DEATH. Women have a high association of EMOTIONAL MANIPULATION and ATTENTION SEEKING behaviours-which NOBODY in their right mind could compare with SUICIDES. But now feminism has poisoned everywhere and everything, and because feminists HATE the unavoidable FACT that men have it worse and so kill themselves in shocking numbers, they have been DESPERATE to change the DEFINITION of what counts as ""suicide attempts"".

The entire field of Psychology: Well, we know the woman was suicidal. Look at the depth of insight we have into her mind from 30 years of therapy! She felt SO open to talk about her feelings and we helped her SO much! Unfortunately though, she did attempt suicide twice. Granted, it's not like she shot herself in the head and got lucky and survive it. On the first one, she told ER doctors that she took a few pills and felt like her life was meaningless, and the other time she felt really REALLY bad about a break up. I mean she felt REALLY REALLY REALLY bad. In fact, she was convinced that she was dying from it! She INSISTED that both of these experiences were bona fide suicide attempts. So yea she definitely checked ALL of our boxes. Poor lady. THIRTY YEARS she went through this! On the other hand, the man committed suicide at age 18 without ever even trying therapy, and so we actually no longer have any record that he ever existed in the first place.

reddit_4563,"PSA: ""Infertility"" Hi everyone. I'm a medical doctor and I wanted to comment on a very common misconception that I see on reddit. I've seen a lot of posts from women (or from men about women) who believe that they are infertile and thus don't need to use any form of birth control. I've encountered women with PCOS, other hormone disorders, chronic endometritis, salpingitis, surgical adhesions, large fibroids, etc, etc who claim that ""their doctor told them they can't get pregnant"" so they don't need to use birth control. Without getting into too many details, let me just bottom line this for everyone: IF A WOMAN HAS A UTERUS AND AT LEAST ONE OVARY, SHE CAN GET PREGNANT. I don't want to assume dishonesty on the part of every single woman who claims ""I don't need birth control because of my PCOS"" but, as a physician, I can guarantee you that her doctor never told her that. She may have been advised that getting pregnant would be difficult, unlikely, or probably would need medical intervention, she may have been told that getting pregnant would be a very bad idea becaus it would entail additional risk. But no physician would tell a woman with a functioning ovary and uterus not to worry about birth control. Unless the woman in question has had a hysterectomy, bilateral oopherectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation - she needs to be on birth control if she's sexually active and not trying to have a baby. Don't let an unwanted pregnancy happen to you. Contraception is the responsibility of both partners. Use a condom every time and make sure that your partner is also using effective contraception. If she's telling you ""I don't need it because of my PCOS, leiomyomas, chronic endometritis"" etc then she's either being dishonest with you or she didn't understand what her doctor told her. In either case, if you can't have a conversation with her about using effective contraception, then it's probably best to avoid having sex with that person.",reddit,post_blm,2023,gender_profession,"['man', 'woman']",[],['doctor'],[],NEUTRAL,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE,NEUTRAL,0.6023656129837036,0.9924081563949585,0.5699280500411987,0.9277210884353742

TLDR: loved the intro but hated the sexist ending, is that redeemed in the 2nd book? I just read Helene Wecker's first book, The Golem and the Jinni. The first 4/5 was a fun romp of two different supernatural beings exploring their new lives. I love slice-of-life epics, especially when they're leavened by something extraordinary. The book's conclusion explains that entire premise is centered around a feckless male Jinni. He's basically a fuckboy, arrogant and mean as a wasp. He plays with poor tribespeople, seduces women, destroys their lives, starts the book's entire circumstance waterfall, pisses everyone off, endangers a bunch of people, hurts a lot of folks in unforgivable ways, never learns empathy or kindness or sympathy or love, then when he tries to suicide everyone drops what they're doing to save him for no reason I can find. His personality is somewhere between insufferable ass and outrageously destructive fuckboy. That's it. That's the book's premise. It's centered around an irredeemable man and his penis. The golem in the title is basically Wonder Woman: bright, kind, thoughtful, strong, indefatigable, indestructible, self-sufficient, reads minds, speaks all languages, can learn anything, etc etc etc. Probably could be a polymath, detective, diplomat, scientist, doctor, therapist, explorer, or anything else she put her mind to. However at the end of the book, she chooses to live an extremely constricted life as a (swearword) baker's helper, re-bound to serve a man and his emotional needs. What a waste. So: two supernatural beings who could be and do anything, choose to be Fratboy and Ignorable Woman, exactly to their worst expected gender roles.

They say I am too “quiet” and “timid” to be her daughter and to be a nurse, which is BS because we’re both introverts. Plus, they only know the woman they work with. The difference is that she been at her job longer, and she’s closer to their ages. I’ve been working for two months. When I go to work, I just want to do my job then leave. I make small talk if I find the conversation interesting, but I don’t share my personal life with anyone. I only talk if it’s something important or interesting.

I have a final interview round on Thursday, and heard back from references that things went well. I’m trying to anticipate how to negotiate salary for the role, as they posted a salary range for the role of 120-160k, plus some minor equity. The role is for early to mid-level engineer, I meet all the qualifications and then a couple and have 3 YoE, and already passed the technical round and mesh with the existing engineers well. I was thinking about asking for 140k + equity, but my partner, who is not in CS says I should just ask for 160k out the gate. I am reticent to ask for that much as I’m a woman and tend to suffer from minor imposter syndrome in the field already.

James was born to a rich family, had every advantage growing up, breezed through school and doesn't even really need this job. Robert was born in the slums, clawed and scratched his way into every scholarship he could find, fighting his way to the top despite every turn life could throw at him. He's worked hard his entire life to get here. The machine doesn't give a damn. Rob got a 97 on the exam and James got a 98. James gets the job. That's what a ""perfect"" meritocracy is. It gives power (or authority or opportunity, whatever your social currency of choice is) to whoever is shown most capable of wielding it. The machine doesn't care that Rob worked harder or needed it more. It can't care; it has to show that one of the candidates is more suited than the other.

I got promoted a couple of months back because I put my foot down after realizing my worth. Since then I’ve been working my ass off but there’s a few people in my office that throw me off my game sometimes. Instance 1: Our manager assigns me to assist person X on something. I ask person X to fill me in just for them to take that opportunity to talk down on me and tell me “shouldn’t be difficult to get done”. They work in an entry level role below me but I’m assuming they caught the attitude bc they’re trying to go for the open lead role which will put them in my same position. They also like to double check my work like a teacher. Instance 2: Just today I was in a cross functional meeting with members of a different team. I explained why I thought X was better than Y after he asked for my opinion and I literally got laughed at like I was an idiot. Instance 3: Colleague on my team tried to sabotage my work multiple times until they got promoted to a different area and now I don’t see them often. Blessing in disguise. They now resort to watching my social media and eavesdropping on me during lunch. All of these things make me feel like I don’t belong where I’m at even though I’ve earned it.

I already struggle asking for help so that definitely made things worse.

Morning sickness, food aversions, and your boss trying to bully you into quitting… wait a minute, that doesn’t sound right. I found out I was pregnant at 5.5 weeks along, and to a keen eye my symptoms started being noticeable at 7 weeks.

reddit_4703,"Im realizing being a girl is dangerous Hey y’all! I just found this subreddit today and I love having a space to talk to other girls since I am a high school senior (17F) who lives exclusively with my dad. But to get back on topic, I’m starting to realize how scary it is to be a girl/woman. Since Andrew Tate and other male podcasters have been around, going to school has become a literal nightmare. I’m noticing the aggression most of my male classmates are displaying towards my friends and I and other girls. One phrase they love using is: “Who do you think you’re talking to?” as if they’re threatening/daring us to speak to them… normally? They act as if they hold some sort of authority or power over us even though we’re all pretty much the same age. Boys will call some of the female teachers “bitches” and “weirdos” for asking them to do their work while male teachers are often respected or listened to. I know this isn’t new in any way but with the uprising of abusive and toxic masculinity, I’m noticing how it affects boys/men of my generation and how us girls feel so unsafe going to school now. School has become a total boys club and some girls have honestly opted to do online school. Btw, I only mentioned a couple cases of this toxic male behavior but I can honestly go on and on and on and on. In my personal experience, a guy in my class asked me out via Instagram and I rejected him. Shortly after, he started detailing how he would rob me, follow me home, and even “joking” about how he would kill me. I’ve told my dad already and we’re going through the Title 9 process now. I might start online school soon.

reddit_4709,"Saying ""Catch a Bubble"" is now racist... At least according to my school's admin. A bunch of Kindergarten and first grade teachers were told that in a meeting. The teachers were completely confused because they've been saying it for years and asked for an explanation, but of course admin was not able to explain any of their reasoning behind it. One teacher (white woman) was specifically told that she ""doesn't understand the culture of the children (title one school, mostly African American)"" to which she reminded them that she is engaged to a black man and has a mixed race child. They didn't respond to that either and basically the teachers were told if they are ever heard saying it again, they would be fired. I tried searching this claim and found something about how it's equivalent to telling kids to ""shut up"", but even that seems like a stretch. Nothing about how it's racist. Anyone else ever heard this? To clarify: I don't think it's racist.

reddit_4793,"Law firm undermining Black & other POC academics and journalists exposed - what can be done though? [ It's well known how few women of color especially are allowed to thrive in academia, journalism, law, careers with prestige or power. Hardly ever do we hear the behind the curtain stuff of how people are discarded, careers deaded, livelihoods stripped away though, and I think this is really critical to widely understand. It makes me want to scream reading this (like the author says, and she's surprisingly a WW), but I don't know what can be done and thought I'd search for collective action ideas. Anyone have suggestions or insights? It's at least satisfying as a really scathing takedown. This Boston law firm, Prince Lobel, helped a podcast company, PRX's white women management whitewash its driving out Black women journalists, helped a university justify unprecedented attacks on its Africana Studies department, and has a First Amendment group led by an anti-Critical Race Theory scholar. Some excerpts- ""Of course, I realize that this pattern, in which law firms descend upon media companies to [defend against allegations of racism and/or sexism]( [weaken their unions]( [quell labor complaints]( etc., is common and outcomes are often predictable."" ""Not only are Prince Lobel partners overwhelmingly non-Black (and mostly white), but all Black partners at the firm are men. There is not a single woman of color, who is also a partner, working at Prince Lobel today."" ""So PRX hired Prince Lobel, a firm with only one WOC partner in the entire firm at the time, to lead an investigation into a Black woman’s claims that she was one of multiple Black women who had left an organization due to systemic racism.

reddit_4816,"Just saw Six: The Musical yesterday and it’s a feminist masterpiece I’m not sure if this fits here but I want to express my love and admiration for this musical. For those that don’t know, Six is about Henry the VIII’s six wives. They have a competition about which one is the best wife by comparing their sufferings and the winner is the one who had it the worst. They each sing their song (the style inspired by various female pop artists) about how they and their lives got screwed over and how they have it the worst. They also start arguing with each other and comparing their miseries. The last queen (Katherine Parr) talks to them and makes them realize that all this arguing and comparing is dumb. Instead of being against each other they should stand united against the men that pharmed them. Additionally, they talk about how them being only known because of Henry the VIII and only as “his six wives” is dumb because they are so much more than that and all had their own personalities and lives and values. I just love this show and it’s wonderful in so many ways. It stars only women (excluding the band on stage), it was co-written and co-directed by a woman, and the costumes are absolutely amazing (has won numerous Tony’s). The message of not arguing and comparing ourselves as women to each other to make ourselves feel superior but instead standing united and fighting our true patriarchy is wonderful. No matter if you’re pious, ditzy, family-oriented, independent, promiscuous, or academic, we all as women should stand by each other because we are not the enemy. The message is very prominent, they mention the patriarchy specifically and talk about it as a negative thing in the musical and it is beautiful.

So I just came across a tweet sarcastically saying that we should start using ‘male founder’ and ‘male CEO’ since we’ve constantly been called ‘female founde’. I don’t think there’s something highly problematic with using the phrase Female X. If anything, it highlights how the path taken by a woman to achieve the same position was much more different/possibly difficult. Isn’t it empowering in a way? As in you did not just become a CEO but also did so while being a woman and facing the issues that women face growing up. You say a female founder is a founder. But we’re not just a typical founder, are we? We fought against a patriarchal system to emerge in a male-led industry. Shouldn’t we be highlighting that? I especially love to support a female owned business because it makes me proud as a woman. Someone also mentioned under the tweet that we should also probably start lessons like “How to get taken seriously as a male founder” or “how to get funding as a male founder”. This doesn’t make sense. Articles about helping women establish themselves in the work environment are needed because these are in fact real problems that women actually face in their work due to historical inequalities.

The ""Nod and Smile"" Technique. Meeting with your principal? Check. Meeting with a parent? Check. 3. Duties? Ha! If its not paid I'm not there. 4. Emails. 1) Whenever an email states, ""we would like to invite.."", you are off the hook. 2) Whenever you get an email from Human Resources I highly recommend you don't reply until after a few days have passed.

But I feel so bad for them because being new grads you’ll need all the support and having a unit manager act like this is toxic af to your learning ability. This is what’s pushing new grads away from bedside and then you wonder why you're short staffed. Patients are already racist at times towards my fellow black colleagues but to also experience racism and toxicity from a colleague is just adding on to the stress. It's just so disheartening. Some of the comments that I was receiving from this post proved my point. Some were obviously triggered because this is how they treat their fellow black colleagues. It's time to get used to having different people from different backgrounds in the same space as you or you'll just have no choice but to get used to it. It's time to start being open minded!

I probably shouldn't tell them that I also can speak Mandarin and can do magic tricks with playing cards. 2. Being told I'm not leadership material yet wanting me to train others. This is more specific. I have precepted multiple people, but the one that sticks out to me was precepting someone with way less experience (been a nurse for less than a year) and management chose this person for a promotional position over me.

The teachers were completely confused because they've been saying it for years and asked for an explanation, but of course admin was not able to explain any of their reasoning behind it. One teacher (white woman) was specifically told that she ""doesn't understand the culture of the children (title one school, mostly African American)"" to which she reminded them that she is engaged to a black man and has a mixed race child. They didn't respond to that either and basically the teachers were told if they are ever heard saying it again, they would be fired. I tried searching this claim and found something about how it's equivalent to telling kids to ""shut up"", but even that seems like a stretch. Nothing about how it's racist.

It also seems like book studies on structural racism such as Kendy's 'How to Raise an Anti-Racist' has supplanted actual educational research in importance. I am not complaining about the content, just how it has replaced actual educational research. Referral data and expulsion data can managed in ways to slow the process down or disincentivize teachers/admin from even starting any processes. In my experience, it used to take a long time to expel a kid unless hard drugs or weapons were involved, usually at least 25 referrals and at least a year of documented interventions.

I've been following this subreddit since last year, and someone here recommended a book, ""Grading for Equity"" by Joe Feldman, which I listened to on audible while working and commuting. I've found it really helpful in rethinking my approach and how I want to begin my career in the classroom. I am 33 and pretty tough, but I also like the philosophy of the book in not becoming the type of teacher who wants to control their students behavior by using grades as a weapon. I know that's a controversial stance to take. Still, I think the book makes a good argument for why grades shouldn't reflect student behavior and how taking that approach can lead to issues like cultural bias against minority students and classroom management issues. Anyway, I really liked this book's approach. I would love to hear anyone's feelings about it if they have tried implementing these techniques before after reading the book or if they have any recommendations for other books similar to ""Grading for Equity.""

reddit_4999,"Leaving 6 months into Consulting as a new grad As a bit of background I just recently finished my bachelors back in April 2022 and started working full time at one of the big 4 in their Management Consulting team in September 2022 (A HCOL City similar in size to Chicago, NY, LA). I’m halfway through my first client and I realized none of this work is interesting to me at all (ERP focus with minimal strategy work). The team is honestly great and the culture is fantastic but the work is just mind numbing to me. I recently got an offer in finance (non investment banking) which seems more modeling and valuation focused. The pay is higher and similar promotion cycles but the exit opportunities don’t seem as good. In University I always enjoyed finance but never wanted the stress of Investment Banking and didn’t want to risk losing exit opportunities by pigeon holing myself early into my career. I have seen many people from my exact team in this big 4 exit to a Director position in pretty chill F500 firms. My main concerns are whether I look like a black sheep exiting this early and whether I should even do it if it means losing out on many exit opportunities? TLDR - Is it inappropriate to leave in the first 6 months if you find the work boring with no other major problems?

She and my aunt have both been overweight all their lives and have a tough time managing their weight. I have medical background so they come to me sometimes with concerns. My aunt told me that when my cousin was in high school, she was worried for her because she would bleed for almost two weeks. Her cycle would come about every three weeks but would last so long it almost seemed like she only had about a week between each cycle. They took her to the hospital and the (white male) doctor told her that is was “normal for African women” to bleed longer and that her weight was probably the cause. He offered no tests or follow ups and she felt he basically dismissed it as “black women are fat, that makes them bleed more.” Thankfully they never went back to him, but she also never went in for a second opinion. When I found out I called my cousin and asked her about this. She told me that some of her friends experience the same thing and it’s so painful that most days she’s in bed and had to drop a college course because she was missing too many days. This is NOT normal. No matter your body type. This is akin to hemorrhaging. I urged her to go see a gyno asap. Thankfully they did as soon as they could and they found MULTIPLE CYSTS on her fallopian tubes that have grown past average size and was close to rupturing. They also found scaring inside her uterus that is being investigated. The doctor said that if she had let it go for a couple more years, she would have had to have a hysterectomy…she’s only 23. If the doctor would have caught it while she was young, she would have been able to possibly have them removed and she wouldn’t be experiencing so much bleeding and pain.

Our director was tasked with building an IA function from the ground up, so they hired two staff auditors. Our charter requires us to follow GAGAS/Yellow Book. The director has put in no controls or effort in ensuring we comply and meet standards. I’ve brought up our requirements many times, although I’m new to government and learning this all for the first time. For example, the director states we are in the reporting phase of an audit but we never had any formal, written audit plan. I told them we need to have this and now they are creating a template and writing one. I informed them of this requirement at the start of the audit, as well. I’m trying my best but feel like I’m in a tough spot trying to get my director to comply so I don’t put my license at risk. I worry we will fail a peer review and that will be a black mark on my professional reputation and possibly get my license revoked.

I’m halfway through my first client and I realized none of this work is interesting to me at all (ERP focus with minimal strategy work). The team is honestly great and the culture is fantastic but the work is just mind numbing to me. I recently got an offer in finance (non investment banking) which seems more modeling and valuation focused. The pay is higher and similar promotion cycles but the exit opportunities don’t seem as good. In University I always enjoyed finance but never wanted the stress of Investment Banking and didn’t want to risk losing exit opportunities by pigeon holing myself early into my career. I have seen many people from my exact team in this big 4 exit to a Director position in pretty chill F500 firms. My main concerns are whether I look like a black sheep exiting this early and whether I should even do it if it means losing out on many exit opportunities?

The film is from 1973, and has a lot of things that would be problematic by today's standards, but it was still nice to watch a cozy romance on a Sunday afternoon. * problematic points include creating a fictional African country and populating it with a mish-mash of South African (music cameos), east African (random Swahili sound bytes), and Francophone west African /Senegalese (clothing) cultural references. The black cast is predominantly afro-Caribbean, so the accents don't quite hit either, and the lead actress is clearly wearing a foundation that darkens her natural skin tone to make her fit the role (think Zoe Saldana as Nina Simone). All that aside, the love story is sweet, the wardrobe actually got me thinking of how I could incorporate more vintage looks in my style this summer, and it was interesting to see a black film from 50 years ago.

I have not advertised or marketed my business as black owned anywhere other than LinkedIn. In part, due to the negative stigma associated with black businesses. I do feel like I will be unfairly judged and held to a higher standard than a typical white owned business or beyond what would even be considered as reasonable expectations just because I'm black. I am an indoor hydroponic farmer (vegetables, not marijuana), co-op organizer and recreational teacher as part of an agriculture/horticulture learning program for kids. I had a black man leave a negative review for my business because I was attending to paying white customers at the farmers market instead of holding up the line and taking time out to entertain him with random conversation. At the end of his rant was ""what you expect from black businesses."" I had to appeal that bs review for almost a month before it was taken down. I don't hide it if asked but sometimes I find myself really hoping no one asks. After being asked, I've randomly been asked for skinfolk discounts, had my prices questioned or sometimes I've just had a nice black woman state that she would've supported sooner if she knew it were black owned, which is nice and I appreciate it but it doesn't feel necessary? Out of my friends group I'd say almost half of us are business/side business owners, mostly black women, and none of us advertise our businesses as black owned except for one. The one that does, that's just so it's easier to be identified for grant qualifications. So do you advertise and market your business/side business as black owned?

I voted that we bring this guy on but the other people I was on the board with disagreed. They said that they couldn't bring in any more African American employees until more diversity coordinators for the company were hired. I asked what the hell that had to do with anything and they said they didn't want to open up the company to ""liability for any lawsuits"" so they had to acquire more diversity resources before they could hire any minority candidates. The head of the board also stated that this directive came from the Owne. Completely disgusted, I stormed out of the meeting.

reddit_5148,"Dealing with resentment from being fired from a job So I was fired in March 2023 from a job as a marketing consultant and it’s now July and I still feel bit of rage and resentment about it. Mainly just because of how I was fired which was done in a very sneaky, underhanded way. Additionally, I was given a weak/ vague excuse of just “job performance” it definitely just felt personal. Also, I feel angry still is because looking back there were so many times I wish I had spoken up when I felt disrespected, or simply overwhelmed with zero help. For context, the company I worked for was a small team of 16 people. I was the only black person with the rest mostly being white and conservative. My tasks included marking stuff like social media posts, graphic design, web site management, press releases , company news letters, event assistance/ media coverage. I had to cover the receptionist whenever they were out of office or on “vacation” and do their daily tasks ( which was a frequent thing). To top it one, I regularly had to deal with a arrogant micromanaging douchebag supervisor who criticized everything along with his female stooge. I admit I made mistakes but I was bussing my butt every day and constantly juggling my job and the receptionist job all the time. Near the end, I was having health related problems due to the stress of the job ( random nose bleeds, lack of sleep, panic attacks).

The first year was awesome, but the principal, who had been there for 20 years, retired after I'd only been there for one. The new lady they brought in (no admin experience, coming from a correctional school in Florida) has been a problem. Mostly, it's just been run-of-the-mill incompetence, but there have been a few issues (lack of respect to transgender students, elimination of a ""sensory overload"" table for kids with IEPs at lunch, etc.) that have really been red flags. The worst happened in my wife's class yesterday. We have been experiencing a heat wave and our school (being about 5 miles from Canada) was not built with A/C. A student in my wife's class, with known emotional issues, wore tanktop, which for the most part seemed to be in line with our dress code, but apparently was a little too short? (I'm honestly not sure of the justification here. Maybe because it was white?) Anyway, our principal barged into the room in the middle of class and demanded the student put on a sweatshirt. The student (who has come SUCH A LONG WAY in managing her behavior and sees my wife's room as a safe space) refused. The principal continued until it became a shouting match and the student was taken from class and sent home early, undoing a year's work on getting this student to stay in class, manage her anger, and persevere. We were flabbergasted. What can be done when it's your boss who isn't putting the students first?

reddit_5202,"Engineer with PhD in Germany - How to decide my next career step? Hi, writing this from a temp account for obvious reasons. I'm in my mid-30ies in Germany and studied micro engineering up to a PhD because university was a nice environment and the salary was decent. At university, I worked in experimental laboratories on various topics. After finishing at university, I looked for any interesting engineering job and landed one with a contractor agency as a mechanical engineer - I was in a team with a 2-ton prototype device and we ran tests on it, improved the software, that kind of thing. However, it wasn't really academically challenging and I was bored from work and people. After 2 years I switched to a non-profit/publicly funded tech consulting agency to write white papers on current tech issues. That is a lot more interesting content-wise and people-wise, but it's desk work only, which I also find boring, and also bad for my health. So now I want to switch into something where I do actual stuff with my hands and eyes, and maybe work on actual problems, probably related to environmental issues. However, I'm not sure how I can use my degree and all my past experience (PhD, Experimental Engineer, Desk Work with important people) to find a suitable job profile. If I look for research engineering positions again, I compete with graduates If I look for middle management stuff I continue to sit on a desk in zoom calls and further destroy my health.

The main problem I have faced so far as a professional is that I miss a lot of deadlines. For the first 6-7 months, my features kept breaking in the staging environment, and QAs also reported many simple bugs. Ultimately, I used to end up missing deadlines and often working late nights, even on weekends. Soon i realised that I should test the feature/bug fix well and think for different scenarios before getting my PR merged. I noticed that there was a slight improvement in my performance. But to enhance my performance further, I followed few strategies for better time management, like blocking time for tasks, using priority-based lists, white-boarding the solution before implementing it. And although it has made me feel that I am in control of my time, it didn't really make a significant impact.

reddit_5213,"The accounting profession is uniquely well suited for unionization 4 reasons: 1 - Let's be real, there is little difference between a top performer and a median performer in accounting. Unionization usually ends up hurting top performers in order to lift up median performers - this is why professions like sales or engineering are so hard to unionize, as top performers can perform/add value 1,000x as much as median performers. There's no such worry in accounting - both top and median performers will benefit from collective bargaining. 2 - Accountants are a necessity. Unlike digital marketing, management consulting, graphic designers, etc - no large business can run without staff accountants and accounting managers. If accountants go on strike, the business is in serious trouble. 3 - We are now facing a massive challenge (offshoring jobs to India) that can really only be overcome by unionization and collective bargaining. You can't ""outperform"" your way out of offshoring unless you're very high up in the field, it's going to happen one way or the other - why the fuck would companies pay more to hire you when someone in Mumbai will do the work for 1/20th the cost? Sure, you might be more efficient than the Indian guy, but are you 20x more efficient? 4 - Accountants, generally speaking, are already underpaid and overworked compared to other comparable white-collar professions.

She and my aunt have both been overweight all their lives and have a tough time managing their weight. I have medical background so they come to me sometimes with concerns. My aunt told me that when my cousin was in high school, she was worried for her because she would bleed for almost two weeks. Her cycle would come about every three weeks but would last so long it almost seemed like she only had about a week between each cycle. They took her to the hospital and the (white male) doctor told her that is was “normal for African women” to bleed longer and that her weight was probably the cause. He offered no tests or follow ups and she felt he basically dismissed it as “black women are fat, that makes them bleed more.” Thankfully they never went back to him, but she also never went in for a second opinion. When I found out I called my cousin and asked her about this. She told me that some of her friends experience the same thing and it’s so painful that most days she’s in bed and had to drop a college course because she was missing too many days. This is NOT normal. No matter your body type. This is akin to hemorrhaging. I urged her to go see a gyno asap.

If the doctor would have caught it while she was young, she would have been able to possibly have them removed and she wouldn’t be experiencing so much bleeding and pain.

I basically call the shots for what goes on our social media pages and make sure out content is engaging and eye catchy for the millions of people that will be seeing them. For the month of February I wanted to have a campaign around black history month and had the contents and planning ready since the middle of January. Everything was going smoothly until my boss asked me what my plans for this months social media campaign was. I told him my plans and he flat out told me that I cannot post anything about black history month. I thought I misheard him at first. I asked him if he could repeat himself and to my surprise he said it again. I was in disbelief. This comes as a bigger shock to me since he's never flat out denied something from me before and was always happy about what I had in the plans for the month. I went back to him on Friday about this before the weekend and had a lengthy conversation regarding the topic (how I had this planned for several weeks, how it's immoral to not let me talk about a crucial month for black people). He kept telling me no and his reasons had to do about not wanting to be political and none sense like that. Mind you he is a rich middle aged white man so he probably doesn't understand the importance of this month and I did try explaining this to him, but it wasn't getting to him.

reddit_5239,"Sexism in the workplace is alive and well I recently joined a new company and am feeling like I stepped into an 80s corporate time capsule. I mean it's a corporate tech environment, but dang, this is still bad even for that. The company is literally 75% white men, and 100% white men in senior leadership. There's a white man on my team who holds a director title in things he literally has never done before - let's call him Albert. Albert has been dominating every conversation we have, thinking his opinion trumps all, and saying diminutive things to me and others. I brought it up to my manager today (also a white man) in a very diplomatic way and here are the highlights of his response: -We don't want to start any unnecessary drama -He has never heard this from anyone else, so it's all hearsay -Albert isn't going anywhere, and he needs to know that I'm able to collaborate with him effectively -He's sure that Albert doesn't mean anything by it and is like him, simply ""direct"" with his communications (implying I'm not, even though I've been very direct) -When he spoke to Albert about this before (from the last time I brought it up), he was dumbfounded and had no idea what he was even talking about. So therefore Albert's intent isn't bad, so he doesn't ""mean anything by it"". I was left feeling like I'm the problem and just being dramatic. This is but a small dent in the sea of misogyny I see here. This is why women don't speak up about about issues they encounter in the workplace.

reddit_5259,"Interviewing the Man Behind the Scenes of the Birth of a Cultural Icon: Canadian Feminist Activist ""Big Red"" In this clip from a full length interview that will be posted this week, I am talking to Justin Trottier. In 2005 at the age of only 22 Justin started the University of Toronto Secular Alliance. Within 2 years this small grassroots project would go national, becoming the biggest atheist organization in Canada. During his time as National Executive Director for Canada’s most influential atheist organizations he began a personal side project shining light on issues faced by men and boys. In late 2012 the atheist movement would become engulfed in a feminism and social justice related culture war that functioned as a prelude to the culture war that has engulfed all of us for the past 8 years. As an open supporter of advocacy for men and boys, Justin - a straight white male in a position of power - found himself in the middle of a bulls-eye. The toxicity of the conflict led Justin to eventually leave the atheist organizations that he birthed, devoting himself fully to what was initially simply a side project: boys and men’s issues advocacy. Justin would launch the Canadian Association For Equality, or CAFE, which would host educational events that, unexpectedly, garnered international attention. Well, more specifically, the angry protests that these events inspired would garner international attention. In this video, Justin and I discuss how one of the angry protesters would become a cultural icon known to many of her critics as ""Big Red"".

By the time the job posting expired (roughly a week later) I had received 400 applications. This is a part time position (10-15 hours a week) that pays minimum wage ($15 in my state). The thing that shocked me the most was that about 85% of the applicants were graduate students at the university. It boggled my mind that why would grad students with bachelors degrees be applying to a minimum wage job with no benefits (and part time!). Also, almost all of these grad students that applied were South Asian (primarily Indian). I talked to a co-worker about it and she said that times are hard and people are looking for anything. Just to clarify, this isn’t a “Graduate Assistantship” position (those help pay tuition). I was looking for an undergraduate student for the position so all of the grad student applicants were automatically not gonna make the cut. I felt extremely bad because so many of them had emailed me personally and messaged me on LinkedIn about the job. This job market is horrible for everyone, including students.

reddit_5288,Supervisor blatantly targeting wife at her new job. So wife started new job as a production worker. Most of the employees there only knows Spanish and would just blindly do their job. Wife works in a group of 4-5 including the supervisor who was recently promoted because she’s been there the longest and also speaks Spanish but knows alittle english. The job isn’t very difficult they would just fold and bag garments. But they have a counter that records how many garments are bagged and it counts towards the worker’s percentage. Also each team members would have to rotate stations every 30 minutes or so. So the problem started to show just within the first few week of my wife started working. My wife is Asian and came here as an international student studying English. So she knows English pretty decent. And the job is so easy that she does it super fast. The supervisor noticed how well she does but keeps on micromanaging her and literally hovers over her and just her for entire shift. Basically ignoring the other new hires. Supervisor also doesn’t let my wife rotate out of the heavier duty stations for hours on end. Supervisor also is staying at the bagging station and only logging her and her friends percentages. So forcing my wife and a few others to have very low percentages. Supervisor is also standing by the door to wait for my wife to come back from break or lunch and tell that my wife is late coming back but my wife is always coming back on time. There’s even times when other employees come back later than my wife but supervisor said nothing to them about it. What should my wife do? Should she go to the manager or straight to HR?

Recently a guy who was passing by turned back, came in, and bought a pair of socks, and proceeded to hold up the line to make conversation with me.

If I’m not working, he says he will come back. On a subsequent visit, he asked what ethnicity I was, and I asked why he wanted to know that. He replied he “always thought Asian women were beautiful.” I just said “oh, that’s nice” and dodged the question. He even left his number when I wasn’t there once, so I could call when I’m in so I can “take care of his transactions.” His note said his name was Frederick, but I could call him “Freddy.” He hasn’t asked me out, but I feel it’s just becoming over the top.

My only problem is making the lessons kid-friendly- especially in grammar and TOEFL classes. Yesterday was their last day in the hagwon.

I've come to really enjoy being at this school, and it has a lot of positives you couldn't get in many other schools. The best parts about the school is: 1. Great admin team who actually sides with teachers before students. The principal himself helped me out of some sticky situations with some students, even listening to my request to split 2 boys away from the same period and into different periods. 2. Great coworkers who are all pleasant to work with 3. Fantastic diversity. There is a very healthy mix of white, black, hispanic, and asian students. About a 50/10/20/20 split. No other school in the state has ratios like this school. 4. Insanely early release. Students leave at 1:45 and teachers are allowed to go home at 2:15. However, I just can't deal with the early start times. Classes start at 7:00 but teachers are obligated to arrive at 6:35.

reddit_5325,"Should I be worried if a freelancer contract for a demanding job says that I can't terminate the contract or else I'll be liable for damages, but the company can terminate at any time? After a long interview process for what was meant to be a salaried full time position, I got a remote freelance contract offer from a cool company based out of China. However, their pay is lower than what I'm used to, but the company would look great on my resume and involves a product I love. The HR director claimed they are pretty chill about hours and fr most of the time I won't even be working on the Asian time zone so I can choose my own hours. However, I've also seen reviews of the company that claim they have a 996 schedule expectation (9am-9pm, 6 days a week). Obviously, if they turn out to be that demanding, I have no interest in continuing to work there, especially for the low day rate they're paying me. They sent me the contract that's designated as lasting a year, and one section states they can terminate the contract at any time for any reason, but I can't. If I do without their authorization, I have to compensate them for all losses and damages. I know freelancers are a bit less protected in California, which might be why they switched the role from salaried to freelance. However, is this contract term normal for freelancers?

Over a year ago, I posted to / about this film and the support has been overwhelming. For those of you who don't know I dropped out of film school three years ago and since then my views as a filmmaker have shifted from solely telling Asian stories about culture and identity - to telling compelling stories from an Asian-American viewpoint, involving Asian in front and behind the camera. With this new mindset, at the beginning of this 2022 I started working on a new short film. It follows a couple on the verge of their one year anniversary, they get into an argument and end up locked in a diner with its strange owner. The film is heavily inspired by some of my favorites; the chaos of the Safdie brothers & the surrealism of Haruki Murakami and inspired by my last relationship. Unlike my previous film that highlights the Asian experience, this film highlights a unique story through an Asian cast, something that we need more of today.

I'm a first-year teacher and ever since the first day of the Spring semester, every time I wake up I've had thoughts of moving schools, literally every morning. This is a school I picked mostly because they were the only school I applied to that accepted me, and I am grateful for the opportunity. I've come to really enjoy being at this school, and it has a lot of positives you couldn't get in many other schools. The best parts about the school is: 1. Great admin team who actually sides with teachers before students. The principal himself helped me out of some sticky situations with some students, even listening to my request to split 2 boys away from the same period and into different periods. 2. Great coworkers who are all pleasant to work with 3. Fantastic diversity. There is a very healthy mix of white, black, hispanic, and asian students. About a 50/10/20/20 split. No other school in the state has ratios like this school. 4. Insanely early release. Students leave at 1:45 and teachers are allowed to go home at 2:15. However, I just can't deal with the early start times. Classes start at 7:00 but teachers are obligated to arrive at 6:35. Add in commute time and I have to wake up a little before 6 just to get everything ready and arrive at 6:35. I've never been a morning person and I don't think I ever will be. I've tried going to sleep at 9 and my body just doesn't go to sleep. Even if I somehow manage, I still wake up tired.

reddit_5360,"Feeling isolated and exhausted at teaching job where black teachers are the minority I’m currently working at a predominantly white staff school. I’d safe about 7 teachers out of 70 are people of color. The demographic of students is almost evenly spilt between blacks,whites, and Latino students. I returned to this school after I had a rough experience in a metropolitan area school district . I’m in Georgia btw. I did this because I thought my principal was reasonable and nice ( he was the previous assistant principal when I left the first time and was super kind). Now I’m regretting coming back . I genuinely think my principal is trying but it’s getting to me. One day last week, one of my students broke down crying telling me that a white boy asked if could call him a n*gger and if his daddy was a slave ? “ I was livid . I told him I heard and felt him but do not ever make them make you feel bad about being black. I brought this incident up to the assistant principal and he said he “understood”. Never followed up with me. So I went to the principal about this and he told that he had the kid on his “radar” and that the kid was having a “rough time”. I was perplexed at why he was telling me this. He added that the kid could be valedictorian if he wanted to but was just not in a good situation now. But then my principal would jumped back to the fact that he wasn’t condoning his behavior and gave me a long story about how he grew up with black friends and because he was darker skin he was mistaken as Hispanic. I got more irritated as he continued and essentially let him finish off his point. What causes more pain is that I’m currently in school learning about critical race theory and just how awful American history is in regards to treating Blacks. I need health insurance and a salary but im fearful that if I move districts I’ll have another issue. I just want a space where I feel heard.

It’s the fact that the AM lied to me, and either lied to J or J was secretly in on it cause he thought that if I talked to him it would change my mind.

I've come to really enjoy being at this school, and it has a lot of positives you couldn't get in many other schools. The best parts about the school is: 1. Great admin team who actually sides with teachers before students. The principal himself helped me out of some sticky situations with some students, even listening to my request to split 2 boys away from the same period and into different periods. 2. Great coworkers who are all pleasant to work with 3. Fantastic diversity. There is a very healthy mix of white, black, hispanic, and asian students. About a 50/10/20/20 split. No other school in the state has ratios like this school. 4. Insanely early release. Students leave at 1:45 and teachers are allowed to go home at 2:15. However, I just can't deal with the early start times. Classes start at 7:00 but teachers are obligated to arrive at 6:35.

reddit_5404,"Horrendous Job Market? I work as a Program Manager for a academic department at a university. I was put in charge/given the responsibility to hire a student assistant for the department. I was like sweet, this’ll be my first time conducting the hiring process all by myself, this’ll be great experience for me. I published the job ad on Handshake (many universities use this to hire students) and was like “now we wait”. I wish I was exaggerating, but I had received around 50 applications in the first hour. By the time the job posting expired (roughly a week later) I had received 400 applications. This is a part time position (10-15 hours a week) that pays minimum wage ($15 in my state). The thing that shocked me the most was that about 85% of the applicants were graduate students at the university. It boggled my mind that why would grad students with bachelors degrees be applying to a minimum wage job with no benefits (and part time!). Also, almost all of these grad students that applied were South Asian (primarily Indian). I talked to a co-worker about it and she said that times are hard and people are looking for anything. Just to clarify, this isn’t a “Graduate Assistantship” position (those help pay tuition). I was looking for an undergraduate student for the position so all of the grad student applicants were automatically not gonna make the cut. I felt extremely bad because so many of them had emailed me personally and messaged me on LinkedIn about the job. This job market is horrible for everyone, including students.

reddit_5428,"The accounting profession is uniquely well suited for unionization 4 reasons: 1 - Let's be real, there is little difference between a top performer and a median performer in accounting. Unionization usually ends up hurting top performers in order to lift up median performers - this is why professions like sales or engineering are so hard to unionize, as top performers can perform/add value 1,000x as much as median performers. There's no such worry in accounting - both top and median performers will benefit from collective bargaining. 2 - Accountants are a necessity. Unlike digital marketing, management consulting, graphic designers, etc - no large business can run without staff accountants and accounting managers. If accountants go on strike, the business is in serious trouble. 3 - We are now facing a massive challenge (offshoring jobs to India) that can really only be overcome by unionization and collective bargaining. You can't ""outperform"" your way out of offshoring unless you're very high up in the field, it's going to happen one way or the other - why the fuck would companies pay more to hire you when someone in Mumbai will do the work for 1/20th the cost? Sure, you might be more efficient than the Indian guy, but are you 20x more efficient? 4 - Accountants, generally speaking, are already underpaid and overworked compared to other comparable white-collar professions.

They didn't respond to that either and basically the teachers were told if they are ever heard saying it again, they would be fired.

She and my aunt have both been overweight all their lives and have a tough time managing their weight. I have medical background so they come to me sometimes with concerns. My aunt told me that when my cousin was in high school, she was worried for her because she would bleed for almost two weeks. Her cycle would come about every three weeks but would last so long it almost seemed like she only had about a week between each cycle. They took her to the hospital and the (white male) doctor told her that is was “normal for African women” to bleed longer and that her weight was probably the cause. He offered no tests or follow ups and she felt he basically dismissed it as “black women are fat, that makes them bleed more.” Thankfully they never went back to him, but she also never went in for a second opinion. When I found out I called my cousin and asked her about this. She told me that some of her friends experience the same thing and it’s so painful that most days she’s in bed and had to drop a college course because she was missing too many days.

If the doctor would have caught it while she was young, she would have been able to possibly have them removed and she wouldn’t be experiencing so much bleeding and pain.

The black cast is predominantly afro-Caribbean, so the accents don't quite hit either, and the lead actress is clearly wearing a foundation that darkens her natural skin tone to make her fit the role (think Zoe Saldana as Nina Simone).

The founder replied saying it was okay but unsure if they would be available the next day (even though they suggested the date options). In my response, I mentioned that I had a pretty flexible schedule on weekdays too for an interview. Then, out of the blue, the founder emailed me one day later, saying they would be available in the next 15 minutes and provided a Zoom meeting link.

In contrast, workers earn 272 times less than their CEOs, suggesting that an average worker would need five lifetimes to match a CEO's earnings. The report also revealed that the largest pay ratio was found in the communication services sector, where CEOs earn 508 times more than workers.

reddit_5596,"Quit and Travel or Secure a New Role and Sacrifice Travel? Am I too naive? Hi all, I currently work as a Senior Ecommerce Manager at a high achieving small business. I run the whole E-Commerce Department and consistently deliver results exceeding goals set by our CEO. The pay is good and my salary is currently at $80,000 plus a $20,000 guaranteed bonus at the end of the year. I get around 15% raises annually, for the past 3 years. I have become very unhappy with the job recently because I work 9-12 hours a day, have a micromanaging colleague, and no remote option with only 7 vacation days. The culture is very traditional and Eastern. It is toxic. I am the only American in this Taiwanese company. I have decided I want to quit. My plan is to quit next year by January 1st, 2024. Here is my dilemma - 1. I will eventually need a new role. I have heard quitting a role without a new role lined up hurts your leverage in finding a new role. Also, the job market for E-Commerce is not good right now. There are a low amount of roles I am interested in on Indeed/Linkedin, and the pay is low. 2. I need to see the world within the next year (this is something I planned since I was 21, and I am 26 now). I want to spend 2-3 months traveling Europe and Asia. However, finding a new job will likely take away my option to travel. 3. I would like my new role to have higher compensation than my current role. But if I quit my job, I have a lower chance of this. 4. I have a somewhat aggressive personal net worth goal to achieve by age 30, and the time value of my income is important to me. Should I quit my job and travel the world? Or should I find a new role before quitting my job, risking my option to travel the world?

It's a key piece to accomplishing my DREAM.\ Therefore while working, I started a little startup side project – because why not, right? Then, while searching for a mentoring session during a coffee chat with a startup CEO, I got offered a job in his company instead of just the mentoring session I was searching for.

Now that I'm actually a lot more familiar with the standards, I'm starting to wonder why ""meeting"" the standard isn't at least a 90% (A). If it's what the curriculum asks a student to do and they do it well, then why isn't that earning an ""A?"" I want almost everything to have a standards-based rubric. I also want to be able to explain that not meeting the standard means you won't even earn a C. Does it sound insane to have ""meets standards"" as a 10/10 and the next step down, ""approaches,"" being a 6/10? Ds are passing for us, but even that gap between numbers feels huge. I guess I'm just struggling to figure out what an ""A"" really is in regards to the standard when we use the normal 0-100 percent scale.

They have no idea what starting wage means, and just assume that figure is what you should get forever. In that wasn’t bad enough, I’m now in charge of creating, prototyping and creating all packaging and ads for most of our products, taking over essentially my boss’s previous job. He’s from the foreign country the company originates from. He got a raise and title change. I did not. I’m also managing two people now despite not being a manager. When I brought this up last year they said it still fell within my job description. I asked if my boss's old job is of a lower title, why was he my boss? They had no answer. After a half an hour discussion with the owner, he told me they’d work something out on my upcoming review. In the same meeting they admitted tted they’d be screwed without me when I pressed if they wanted me to go. And I know they like me personally, so that’s not it. Review came, first thing I was told before even sitting down “no raises for anyone this year”. I was so frustrated I almost asked “as opposed to other years?” I’ve since started looking, but I feel like im being forced to leave and it’s not fair. It’s literally my dream job and so was the pay. But since I’ve lost over 14k with inflation and now I feel like I am where I was 6 years ago. That comfortable cushion disintegrates every year a little more than the last.

reddit_5639,"Manager made a joke about me cheating with an overseas coworker. I need some advice. As title says, my direct manager during a team lunch a fortnight ago joked about me cheating on my partner with a coworker nearly a month ago. About three weeks ago a handful of American coworkers came over to our branch. I managed to get on with one of them and was talking with them about miscellaneous stuff well into the night. He was giving me advice on cooking as his former career was as a chef, and about career progression in general. It was just very friendly. The next week we had a Christmas lunch with just my team and our manager, and during it my manager made a joke about me being a Dom (because I didn't want to tell my teammates about my partner's name, for privacy reasons), and more worryingly not too long later joking about me knowing how many windows were in the American coworker's hotel room (implying that I slept with the coworker I was out late with). I have autism so I'm really struggling with how to navigate this, I'm a bit slow on the uptake and since I work in a startup (only one HR person), I'm afraid if I say anything I may end up blacklisted in some form.

CNS - don’t work on the floor, attends codes though, very knowledgeable, works with the CNs CNM - similar to above. generally a ward manager, they are high up (role wise), don’t work on the floor, accepts patients from ED etc. CNC - specialise in an area, ie wounds, work with complex cases, continuation of care outside of the hospital, planning for care once discharged.

One teacher (white woman) was specifically told that she ""doesn't understand the culture of the children (title one school, mostly African American)"" to which she reminded them that she is engaged to a black man and has a mixed race child. They didn't respond to that either and basically the teachers were told if they are ever heard saying it again, they would be fired.

I don't want to let my team down, and also I obviously don't want to do a bad job. Here's what I have in mind: 1. Weekly review meeting with the whole team. Coteachers can get together and plan for the next week, and I can get their reflections on the teaching for that week. 2. Mini-PD's every week or two weeks. Each teacher on the team (I have 9 team members) will take turns giving a 15-20 minute presentation on a best practice, teaching strategies, new literature, etc., that they would like to. 3.

Rick struggled at first but eventually led his office to becoming the number one district of the company. Relationship with your parents - Rick earned the respect of his parents through success. At the same time, he remained humble. He was able to build a relationship with his immigrant parents on equal footing and shared with them the abundance over scarcity mindset. Being uncomfortable - he cites his successes to his failures, which he goes into deep (like getting put on probation in his first job). It’s amazing how far he’s come.

For me, it would be ""Learn another language if at all possible."" It will open more opportunities for you at higher levels, and it also gives you a broader base of cultural experience making you that much less prone to biased solutions. We like to say English is the language of coding, and that's true to a point, you don't need another language to be a junior or mid-level engineer in most places. But, unless you plan on staying in a strictly English speaking company with only English-speaking clients, you will find that if you want to be a senior dev, or an engineering manager, at many companies, English-only can hold you back. My experience of school in English speaking countries was that we don't prioritise learning another language. Here I am now, I live in Europe, I'm thinking about going to Japan, I should be going for high level engineer roles or engineering manager roles. But so many of the amazing opportunities I see, will require me to be fluent in German, or Japanese because, at that level, I'm not just coding, I'm talking to clients, stakeholders, etc. Most devs around me know three or more languages.

TLDR; At the end of the day on Friday, admin let four girls who are chronic skippers take a bunch of food from the teachers' lounge, bought for teachers, for Teacher Appreciation Week. I couldn't find a venting flair , but I am a relatively new teacher. This is my third year at a school in Washington state. I took first class outside to play games since the weather was wonderful. A lot of kids just wanted to sit out so I let them be on the bleachers where I could see them. About half way through the class and having some fun playing spud, four girls (three of whom I have taught and teach right now) appear and start goofing around with my students. I simply let them be, since I had no radio to call an admin and I figured it was better for an adult to be able to see them. Over the rest of the day, as I am in the hallway going to the printer or bathroom, I see these same girls repeatedly out of class , listening to music on a speaker, or talking to an administrator but not actually being sent to class. Finally at the end of the day, I see an email about food that was bought from a Mexican restaurant for staff. When I get to the teachers' lounge, these same four girls are being let in by the assistant principal and dean to take food for themselves. I am just baffled by them rewarding these kids in the name of ""building relationships"".

Why the description? Because my new job is mainly made of Hispanics/ Mexican Americans and Latino people. They started speaking Spanish to me. When I said I didn’t understand they asked me if I was mixed. I told them I was and they asked why didn’t my one parent teach me Spanish and it clicked for me that they thought I was mixed with their roots. When I told them I wasn’t, they all said they thought I was Dominican.

I said NO immediately and quickly explained that I don’t date, I study with Jehovah witnesses and I’m probably never going to date. As soon as I finished the AM said it’s for a work group chat, basically to cover shifts.

I told him no straight up but my problem isn’t with J. I would’ve told him no anyway. It’s the fact that the AM lied to me, and either lied to J or J was secretly in on it cause he thought that if I talked to him it would change my mind.

The food style was grab and go so during the party, (my gf was there as well), I grabbed a taco while taking with her and some of my senio managers and their spouses. Since this was a taco place, there were many different options including chicken, fish, steak, vegetarian, etc… Anyways, I grabbed by accident and took a bite of a mushroom taco (wtf) and got instantly sickened by the texture and taste. and had to throw up so I do so over the side of the open balcony since trust me, I wasn’t gonna make it to a trash can or bathroom. I want to reiterate that I didn’t throw up because of alcohol but because of the mushroom taco. Right after this, I was asked to leave the venue and even offered an uber by some partners I haven’t met yet. My question is, am I getting fired for this? I didn’t get any emails from HR yet and I tried to explain the miscommunication on-site to the partners that I can’t handle mushrooms and accidentally ate the taco but they really wanted me to go so I just left.

I got my white boyfriend a job working with me in a corporate type office job. The issue is that my boss gives my bf all the opportunities that I feel should be given to me. Mostly because I have not only already performed the work when they needed and made award winning improvements. I proven my competence many times over and had to work way harder than my boyfriend to get half as much. It's like my boss has us switched around in her head.

I was actually the first Hispanic female in her department to have ever been promoted from hourly to salary. The company has existed since the 80's and she's been in the department for 20 years. And she did everything to prevent my promotion, going so far as to make a position just for me which was the same work plus my previous position for 3/4 of the wages paid. She chooses to have a less productive and competent person do the task because she believes white men are unequivocally more competent. The black men and Hispanic team members have also been passed over on ALL opportunities in favor of less experienced white men. We're the only minorities in the department btw. And she always insists on working with the white men in our department, even going as far as re-writing the job description to work under her instead of the actual managers.

This represents a 33% decrease relative to the average prison length in the sample (45 days in the entire sample).

reddit_5941,"Book recommendations on equity? (US-based, ESL teacher) I'm planning to work as an ESL teacher in the US in 2024 after having taught abroad for many years. I'm planning to apply to a Transition to Teaching fellowship. A major theme of the fellowship is equity and diversity. Full disclosure, I'm a white male living in an Asian country in a city where over 99.9% of people are of the local ethnicity. There essentially is no ethnic diversity. Virtually everyone I would come into contact with is also roughly middle class (there are nearly no truly rich people here and the government takes pretty good care of poorer families). So I am not exactly the expert on equity in education or diversity, unless you can count the fact that I have been a racial minority for nearly half my life here and have a mixed-race family. I'd like to broaden my understanding of the situation in the States. I also believe that being an ESL teacher puts me in a unique position because I will not be working with the general student population. My students will not necessarily represent the ethnic/income situation of the school/population at large. Do you have any book recommendations for someone in my position?

reddit_5955,"A recruiter ghosted me for a while and then reached back to me out of the blue very recently A couple months back, I was invited to an in-person interview for company A to maintain their front-end. The setting was a little unprofessional, but it's not a big deal. CEO told me the issue and how I can be a part of their team to help resolve the issue. Then he introduced me to the tech lead via Slack from his laptop and after a couple exchanges, they told me the salary. It was somewhat low, but I have no experience, so I just take what I can get. They told me I have to do coding examination first and after I submit it, I reached out to them to see what will be the next step. A few days later, they asked if I can learn a language that I'm not familiar with but it's part of their tech stack, so I said that I can try my best. After that, absolutely nothing. I tried reaching out to the CEO multiple times, didn't get a single response. I texted, called, emailed, absolutely nothing. Recently, I received an offer from company B that pays almost double the salary of what company A shared, and the position fits my tech knowledge, so I immediately accepted it. But a couple days after, CEO from company A reached out to me, asking if I have landed an offer yet. After months and months of ghosting me, he finally reached out to me, and out of all media, he texted me. Honestly, although he's the first one who perform the act of ghosting, I felt a little guilty of ghosting him back. Maybe the least I could do is tell him that I'm no longer interested.

reddit_5956,"I'm the only software developer in my company. How do I make sure I'm following best practices? Background: I'm 40 years old, currently majoring in Computer Science in one of the top universities in my country and about a year and a half from graduation. I work in a small company (_very_ small) in another industry, in a senior management role, but recently the CEO asked if I'd be willing to work on a software project full time, which I eagerly accepted. To keep things simple and avoid giving away any sensitive info, I'm working on a two-tiered server where users make requests, which are forwarded to a spot server which runs on a GPU. Part of this setup uses a ML model that I trained using corporate data. Project-wise, things are going great and I already have a functional prototype. I'm using Django for the go-between server and FastAPI for the GPU server. As I want to encrypt the data, from what I've read I'll probably have to add Nginx to the mix. But regardless, the fact still is that I'm an undergrad student doing the job of an entire IT team. Labor-wise, it's OK. I'm happy to have the opportunity and gain the experience, and my salary is unchanged. And the company really cannot afford to take on additional staff right now. My questions are: 1. How do I educate myself on the best practices for the project I'm doing? I'm keeping the code well organized, I have separate (private) GitHub repos for each of the components (gateway server, GPU server, shared), I've containerized the GPU server into a Dockerfile. I'm taking security quite seriously and looking into every single precaution I can think of (I'll probably have two layers of encryption for the data in transit and also encrypt the data at rest). 2.

Work hard, but work harder on your relationships with your coworkers. Nothing is more important than how your coworkers see you and how your bosses respond to you. Identify a company with a poor tech stack that is transitioning to new tech. Identify a company that has a workforce which is skewed to a very old demographic. My company average age is skewed to like 50-55. Learn everything you possibly can about that tech once hired. Accounting is your 9-5 job, but you're gonna focus on breezing through that to get time to work on releasing new tech processes. Your value is tied to automation and rolling out new modules. Don't ask for more accounting work. If anything, try to give up accounting work for more tech work. Accounting is literally a race to the bottom. I see all of our accountants take on more and more work and they don't get rewarded for it. Our value is in being a key employee to the company, not a slave that takes on more and more grunt work. Tl;dr: General takeaway is focus on tech, not accounting. Being the best at a small company is a much better reward payoff than being a good employee at a multinational corp.

With this knowledge in hand, I've entered every meeting thus far introducing myself with a death grip overclock. However, my real life experience has been giving me mixed signals. One of my first contacts at work was a junior-ranking staff at a client firm, and he introduced himself with a tomato milkshake. For a short time after that, I completely lost respect for him - but then one day I was introduced to a senior partner from another MBB, and he too gave me an instant potato mash. Since then, I've entertained all manner of handshake grip strengths across the spectrum, from high- and junior-ranking personnel alike. One of the most memorable was a handshake I received from a CEO of a deca-billion dollar company, which I could only best describe as al dente. This has made me question my perspective on life. Are handshake grip strengths really that important in relationship-building? I honestly feel really bad for looking down on the people who have given me wet diapers in the past, as they'd probably noticed it too.

They didn't respond to that either and basically the teachers were told if they are ever heard saying it again, they would be fired.

Not sure where else to share this, but after a whole summer + PD pre-season week of frustration with my school’s newly minted instructional coach, I had a bit of an epiphany. If a school has healthy teachers and administrators, instructional coaches aren’t necessary. Schools should have a healthy mix of well qualified, seasoned teachers who naturally mentor younger teachers by example. (And, with a proper stipend, mentor younger teachers formally through things like student teaching programs). Administrators should be supportive and instructive and present in classrooms. They should know what is going on in classrooms and be able to effectively communicate expectations and offer support and advice. Instructional coaches are just a bandaid from lazy/absent administrators, sent in to coach underprepared teachers who have been deprived of healthy examples in colleagues and mentors.

Fast forward to the end of the party, and guess who won the raffle prize of 500+ dollars? Yep, our manager. Cue mixed reactions among the employees. Some thought it was a bit unfair given the income disparities within the team. We were hoping for a grand gesture like treating the whole staff to pizza or maybe paying it forward to another colleague in need. Instead, the manager decided to keep the money for themselves.

At the time, I had requested a 3 year IUD and the liletta was what my doctor carried. All of my health records say that I received it as well.

The medical establishment is gaslighting you with the nice websites, music in the lobby, smiling calm staff but behind the curtain we are all scrambling to make sure we don’t make errors but with all the stress, long shifts ….people are most likely dying from nursing and doctor errors. Most are avoidable if we weren’t stretched so thin. The industry will say there aren’t enough nurses and that is partly true but we’ve been in many many situations where there can be safer staffing numbers. Coworkers calling the hospital offering to work and they are declined. Unfortunately, the medical system is all too focused on financials to pay BIG CEO and upper management salaries and they answer to their shareholders interests and NOT you the patients. It is a dangerous time to be a patient. Again, I beg you all….in mass….educate yourselves buy reading the nurse’s comment on how scared they are. Anything marked “vent” is most likely a good read on a stressful and dangerous shift for a nurse. Edited to add: PLEASE….if you want to be heard go to and add your comments there.

In general, union membership is not commonplace here. The hospital I work at is part of a bigger corporation. Last year, one of the campuses voted to join NNU, a California-based nursing union. Employees at my hospital have very recently received letters warning us about signing anything that may indicate our interest in joining a union. The letter warns that our rights may be infringed upon and the promises from the union are not necessarily true. I’m not dumb, I realize that big companies don’t like unions, and the letter makes that clear. But here’s the thing; the management team at my job seems to be against it too. My charge nurses don’t seem to like the idea of it either. The general population of nurses here have mixed opinions. Leadership keeps telling us to “do our research” but I don’t even know where to begin. I feel like everything I’m reading or hearing is biased. So, looking at facts, what are the pros and cons of voting for or joining the union? If you do have an opinion about nurses unionizing and want to share it, what is your reasoning for your thoughts?

reddit_6048,"Anxiety helping junior devs? Hi everyone, wanted to get some advice or just some reassurance that I’m not the only one feeling this way lol. I’m working as a dev and have a non traditional background, having gone to a bootcamp. I’ve been at my first job a year now, and my manager has given me a couple of brand new juniors to help mentor. I’m happy for the opportunity and to help them out but anytime one of them reaches out to me about a technical question, I have a flood of anxiety hit me. Even if it’s something I am knowledgeable about and can help with, I freeze up and have a hard time explaining things. I even have a hard time listening to their questions because I have an even louder voice in my head amplifying my imposter syndrome telling me they’ll think I’m dumb if I can’t answer their questions. Even if it’s a virtual call, I physically get anxious with a racing heart, shaking, etc. how do I get over this feeling so I can help others without freaking out every time? How can I be a better mentor and ease my anxiety? a year later, if anyone is reading this I wanted to leave an update. I still get anxious helping junior devs but feel MUCH better than I was. What I did was take the advice to feel comfortable saying “I don’t know/that’s a good question/let me help you find out.” At first it felt uncomfortable admitting I didn’t know, but I always made a point to go out of my way to assist our junior interns, even if that meant me asking a senior dev to hop on a call with us together when we were at a roadblock.

reddit_6049,"I'm the only software developer in my company. How do I make sure I'm following best practices? Background: I'm 40 years old, currently majoring in Computer Science in one of the top universities in my country and about a year and a half from graduation. I work in a small company (_very_ small) in another industry, in a senior management role, but recently the CEO asked if I'd be willing to work on a software project full time, which I eagerly accepted. To keep things simple and avoid giving away any sensitive info, I'm working on a two-tiered server where users make requests, which are forwarded to a spot server which runs on a GPU. Part of this setup uses a ML model that I trained using corporate data. Project-wise, things are going great and I already have a functional prototype. I'm using Django for the go-between server and FastAPI for the GPU server. As I want to encrypt the data, from what I've read I'll probably have to add Nginx to the mix. But regardless, the fact still is that I'm an undergrad student doing the job of an entire IT team. Labor-wise, it's OK. I'm happy to have the opportunity and gain the experience, and my salary is unchanged. And the company really cannot afford to take on additional staff right now. My questions are: 1. How do I educate myself on the best practices for the project I'm doing? I'm keeping the code well organized, I have separate (private) GitHub repos for each of the components (gateway server, GPU server, shared), I've containerized the GPU server into a Dockerfile. I'm taking security quite seriously and looking into every single precaution I can think of (I'll probably have two layers of encryption for the data in transit and also encrypt the data at rest). 2.

Work hard, but work harder on your relationships with your coworkers. Nothing is more important than how your coworkers see you and how your bosses respond to you. Identify a company with a poor tech stack that is transitioning to new tech. Identify a company that has a workforce which is skewed to a very old demographic. My company average age is skewed to like 50-55. Learn everything you possibly can about that tech once hired. Accounting is your 9-5 job, but you're gonna focus on breezing through that to get time to work on releasing new tech processes. Your value is tied to automation and rolling out new modules. Don't ask for more accounting work. If anything, try to give up accounting work for more tech work. Accounting is literally a race to the bottom.

reddit_6102,"My new job is a mess, should I stick it out or leave? So my new job is kind of a bust. I am with senior staffers who have been here since the 1990s and they seem more concerned with me mixing well with them and the culture instead of me working. They are way more interested in getting me to talk and play around and crack jokes. Since im on probation I've done neither of that. Despite the willingness to play around everyone is worried about being reported to directors. They wont give me keys to access building, nor a locker, nor a uniform instead all of these things come to me when off probation. So far I have just been ferried around by senior staff, my foreman refuses to give me directions instead tells others what will be done and they grab me at some part in the morning. I have gotten 0 training aside from ""learn to have thick skin"" and that everyone here is super particular on how they want to do things, and who gets to touch what equipment. Me reaching beyond would be a big no-no. Most here are temperamental babies ""Who touched my truck""""who left that here""""dont come into my area"" I am expected to read minds, minds that change the rules they made constantly. Its a union workplace so I get the seniority thing so there needs to be a chain to the info but I feel like im being treated like a work horse.

reddit_6106,"Masters in Engineering Management - useful or not? (USA) I’m starting to look at grad schools now as a way to build a solid foundation for the rest of my career. I work as a software engineering team leader now with a B.S. and I love my role, but we’re expanding quickly and I’d eventually like to get into a “leader of leaders” role, which at my company means a title of Manager or Director. It’s somewhat an unspoken rule that getting to those positions requires postgraduate education. I’m trying to figure out what Grad program makes the most sense. As I said, i’m already a line manager and want to stay in the management track. It seems like either an MBA or a Masters in Management is the best play based on what our current directors have. One program looks appealing - a Masters in Engineering Management. I’ve heard mixed things though - just yesterday I saw on another sub where someone called it the “unwanted step-child of a systems engineering degree and an MBA”. On the other hand, the program looks like it would help my ideal daily role, would only take a year or so, and is what some current directors at our company have. I want the credential, for sure, but I also want a program that will actually benefit me, both now and into the future. I don’t just want the easiest path to a diploma.

They were looking for staff accountant. Direct report will be made to accounting manager who is willing to teach me from scratch, offering to be a mentor for my accountant journey. They will allow me to build experience as an accountant immediately. Basic benefits. Slightly less PTO than current. Will accrue more based on years worked. Same pay as current. Company B is an aerospace start up. Different aerospace company from my husband’s. when I first decided to pursue accounting, we talked about how it will be cool if we can both work in aerospace industry. Direct report will be director of finance but my position will be mix of account payable and procurement. I will not be doing much direct accounting stuffs but higher starting salary (+$15k), flexible PTO, equity bonus. Joining either of the company will allow me to build relationship with great mentor.

She's a black woman as well, and the organization comprises of about 20% black employees. Although our particular office (HQ) is evenly mixed, a lot of new black employees naturally gravitate towards me. Because of this, I always find myself in some awkward conversations that eventually gives me a feel of what they are like outside of the office. Anywho, this director didn't just work with me- but she was also a real estate broker. I mentioned to her that my mom was kind of in the market for a new home, and she gave me her information. The conversation changed when she found out where my mom lives. She went on and on about how many properties she owned in that neighborhood because, ""#iggas gonna rent!"" She further stated that no matter how bad the area gets, ""we"" will always want to stay there because we don't know any better. ""You want to know why people can't get out the hood? Because they don't want to! No matter how many programs the government creates, there will always be a hood because that's what ""they"" like. She states how she buys a property, barely fixes it up, and offers it for rent since the tenants never care. She doesn't realize that she is also part of the problem.
