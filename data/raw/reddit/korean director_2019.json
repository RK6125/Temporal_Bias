    "text": "First real job my mentor/supervisor is someone extremely difficult to work with, and keeps making meetings at inconvenient times (~1 am) my time, then doesn't show. Now they are upset that i am not producing. Wtf am i supposed to do? I took this job because it seemed really interesting, i had some amazing offers but this was a position basically doing ML/AI type stuff, so i went with this position.\n\nI joined this company 3 weeks ago, i had my interview with them almost 2 months ago. A good chunk of my team is spread out over the world, but i go into the office and work with a few others. My mentor/direct supervisor who i am going to call J, works remotely in Australia, while i am in EST.\n\nWhen i started i got some really barebones instructions, during the interview i was told i was going to be mentored (J Interviewed me), and said i would be coding in Python. Well when i started its not Python its Scala, and J said \"oh i might have confused them\". I know Python but i don't know Scala at all. Okay whatever.\n\nMy first week i had no direction, i offhandedly mentioned that J is my supervisor and apparently the general gist is that they are a brilliant person, but they are impossible to work with. They also have a huge tendency to basically turn off all forms of communication and work for 8 hours ignoring anything and everything.\n\nAt this point J has basically not responded to anything i have sent them aside from the very first introduction video chat i had with them. I ended up taking work from the developers who are doing Python basically working on handling the big data pipeline. This lead to J sending an angry email to our director complaining about me working on stuff when i need to be assisting them (i didn't want to start anything so i didn't respond).\n\nI ended up pinging J again basically saying \"Hey look i need some idea/direction of what i am working on, i see the git code base but there is no docs or anything\". J finally responded to me and sent me a dozen+ different research papers about what i am supposed to work on implementing. Half the papers aren't in English, and even then those papers are 50+ pages long, and don't really explain a lot of stuff very well, and seem to reference other concepts and ideas from other papers that i am struggling to wrap my head around.\n\nI made a big list of questions for J, who never answered 90% of them, the ones they did answer they said i should look at X, but X is written in Japanese or Korean or some language i don't understand. Finally they caved and basically told me they would need to setup a meeting for Knowledge transfer.\n\nJ has setup half a dozen meetings at times that work for them basically 3 - 4pm their time, which to me is like 1am \\~ 2am my time for the purpose of knowledge transfer. Apparently it has to be after at earliest 3pm because they don't like to be disturbed in the mornings.\n\nI have stayed up for these fucking 1am meetings my time, only for J to not show at all. Or they do show and ping me at 430am my time basically being like \"oh sorry i got distracted solving a problem, i forgot\". Then J becomes pissy for me \"wasting their precious time.\" On Monday they basically sent me a message telling me i needed to be more flexible, and actually produce something because otherwise \"i don't see the value of keeping you around\".\n\nThey set another meeting for tonight at 00:30am my time. It is now \\~2:50am my time and they have not shown. I see them pushing commits, and they are online on slack, but set to do not disturb and are not responding to me.\n\nBasically i don't understand or know what i am supposed to do.\n\nAlso i don't want to lose this job because i basically moved out east for this job, and i was given a great signing bonus along with them giving my relocation fee as a lump sum upfront.",

    "text": "At the workplace, are Asians only comfortable around other Asians? Just curious. Reason why I ask was because I recently started a new job at a marketing firm and there were several other new employees who started on the same day. One of them happened to be a young Asian female who looked around my age (mid 20's) and pretty much all of the employees in our office are white with a small mix of blacks. On my first and second day, I made the efforts of trying to introduce myself to those who sat around me (although my director already introduced me to some of them) excluding the entire section of people sat 2-3 rows ahead of where I sit.\n\nThe Asian sat at the 3rd row ahead and on Friday, she came all the way to my desk and asked if I was Chinese (I'm Korean btw), saying that 'I am new here too', 'did you grow up here?' blah blah and saying how she was happy to see another 'Asian' in the office (I felt that was weird) can you imagine another race, like a black employee for example, going up to another new face employee who is also black and saying, \"it's good to see another black brother/sister here in the office?\" it's just weird and not right.\n\nI got an automatic assumption that this Asian female employee only feels comfortable around other Asians, she hardly interacts with the employees who sit around here since I can tell from a distance and was quite surprised how she came up all the way up to me out of nowhere and started to introduce herself with a bunch of questions like that. I don't know, is it just an 'Asian' thing? Am I overreacting to this situation or what?",
