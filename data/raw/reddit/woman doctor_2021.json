    "text": "Being overworked, no idea what to do. Apologies if wrong tag, I have no idea what other one to use.\n\nI (19f) am a PART TIME assistant store manager for a retail store that sells little girl's stuff and pierces ears.\nWhen I was hired, I made it very clear that I am disabled, I absolutely cannot work more than 20 hours a week which my employer was completely fine with. That was when we had four employees at this specific store, not we're down to two; me and the store manager and I'm nearing 35 hours a week with no time off. I'm considering quitting but then that leaves EVERYTHING to this store manager. I'm being given no days off, I've had to cancel all of my doctor's appointments and am anxious because I have weekly shots that cause me to collapse if I don't rest immediately afterwards and I'm being scheduled 30 minutes after my shots.\nI can't take this anymore. I want to quit, but I don't want to leave all of this work on this woman. I desperately need the money since I'm in the process of reapplying for SSI, but I keep passing out at work, I'm not getting enough sleep and I've had to miss three incredibly important doctors appointments just this week. Would I get in trouble if I quit? I don't think I can, but I'm so scared. This is my first ever job excluding babysitting gigs, I just wanted something super part time, maybe 10-15 hours a week.\n\nThe store manager is already at 45 hours a week for herself and keeps leaving everything else on me. I know this is hard for her too, I shouldn't blame her but it's even more frustrating because she leaves early every day and has me come in early, going over the hours I'm legally allowed to work due to my medical conditions.\n\nDo I just give my two week's notice? Do I try to stay until the girls we're trying to hire are ready to take over the job and learn everything they need to learn to operate the store? Do I just leave? I don't know what to do, I've never quit a job before.",

    "text": "Leaving a toxic job was the wake up call I needed to fulfill my dreams and reconnect with what is important. \nI started a job last September after being offered a competitive position at a boutique accounting firm in Victoria BC. The role consisted of operating as the Office Manager/Executive Assistant. \n\nI had an administrative background but little awareness of how intense an accounting firm could be or what this job truly would entail. I decided it was a great way to learn the ropes in a competitive industry with opportunity to make great wealth should I choose to pursue this path. \n\nI started the job with very little training and no educational base from a business administrative standpoint but my new bosses liked me and my confidence and had no qualms throwing me directly into the fire. The staff that would be training me were ESL and introverted, having no way to comprehend the best approach to teaching. \n\nDespite having to learn much of the role myself, I managed to keep on track and fulfill my duties. It was stressful but I assumed this would settle as I learned my duties. Alas, this would not be the case as I would soon see. \n\nShortly after being hired on,the stalky \n, unattractive and obnoxious office bully set her jealous eyes on me when I started gaining compliments and recognition for my extroversion, attractiveness and charisma in the office that transcended her own. She soon made it her mission to make my life hell. \n\nThis woman would ridicule and bully me to everyone in the office. When I was learning the role, if I did not know something, she would publicly announce how stupid I was and broadcast every error I made including to one of my bosses whom favoured her. \n\nI tried managing the situation by having private conversations with her about how I felt about her attitude and behaviour but she would go right back to her ways shortly after. \n\nDespite my rage I kept it together, until she decided to continuously bully and degrade my sweet natured coworker whom was too shy to stand up for herself. \n\nAlong with another coworker, we recorded and brought her despicable behaviour to my managers attention. They tried to rectify the situation but the boss that loved her told us that she had done nothing wrong and that we needed to grow a backbone. \n\nAfter another coworker reported her, the boss had no way to dodge the complaints and instead decided to yell at me for starting the whole thing to which I was calm and unmoved in his presence. From that day on he had an axe to grind with me. \n\nEach day I went to the office it got busier and I was left to do the bulk of the admin work in an office that required several admins to fulfill the position. As I proved myself capable and intelligent, I was handed piles of more work with no raise in wage as I was promised upon hiring and no benefits. \n\nI was the first to arrive an hour early and worked through lunch at my desk to get all my tasks done. This was commonplace in the office and an unspoken expectation. \n\nOn top of the ridiculous workload, I had to maintain the complex schedule of my other boss who requested all sorts of wild tasks ranging from private detective work, translations,  beginners bookkeeping and once I was even asked to participate in espionage against a clients enemy( I declined). \n\nI went home crying/cried in the bathroom\nat the office from being yelled at or bullied frequently and my health was starting to decline. In addition to this, my relationship with my partner was suffering as I was so stressed all the time and it led me to be exhausted and irritable with no reprieve for us at home.\n\nIt was after three or four months that I started to notice my health was slipping, I gained weight and was fatigued all the time. My wrists started to ache and pain from typing for 9hrs every day. I was losing my hair. I made an appointment with a doctor after the wrist pain wouldn’t go away and was diagnosed with carpal tunnel. \n\nI told my boss and manager about the injury but there was not much to be done and not much offered. We were approaching tax season and in spite of my extreme desire to quit and move jobs, I would feel terrible leaving when they required my help the most so I toughed it out. I purchased wrist splints for work and went to physical therapy , I got TPI injections and desperately tried to manage my pain but the carpal tunnel only got more aggressive and painful. I had to wear tiger balm and use pain killers all day and I was spending more than I could afford on therapy, taking money from my education fund to support myself. I was absent or working from home to ice my wrists and manage my pain whenever possible.\n\nMy doctor saw that my muscle tissue in my hands was wasting and saw how exhausted and stressed I was and told me to go on medical leave. I finally bit the bullet and handed in my leave. My two managers and one nice boss were supportive but the boss whom had a chip on his shoulder decided this was his opportunity to get back at me for standing up to his pet. \n\nHe dismissed me without notice two weeks before I had told them I would be leaving (illegal to do without severance) and decided to claim I owed the company $400 of time due to the fact it was not recorded in the system . I had not been trained to enter time in the system as I was on salary and the other girls were hourly and forgot to do so . I had kept track of my hours on an excel spreadsheet but he fought me on the validity of this. Him and the office bully were responsible for my final wages and my ROE (to my dismay) and I had to fight for both of these to be delivered to me two weeks late. I went without pay for this time and had no way to seek medical benefits without this. He was holding my ROE hostage until I agreed to the pay cut. \n\nHe was always arrogant and mean natured but this was shocking. I had always been the first one in the office and everyone had witnessed how long and hard I worked. To claim I hadn’t been present during this time was absolutely offensive and malicious.\n\nI would also like to note that this man was a multimillionaire and trying to nickel and dime someone whom was injured from the job and trying to support her healing on a very low salary. \n\nThere was no compassion and I had to get legal advice, support from the Employment Standards Act and Service Canada to get the bare minimum from these people. Two weeks of absolute hell and minimum contact from my employers.I had pleaded my more empathetic boss for his help but he made promise after promise to take care of it but did not until I threatened to report them. \n\nI was an absolute wreck and my health was in tatters, I was getting fevers and chills, passing out and shaking for two weeks. I was diagnosed with Addison’s Disease shortly after ( your body cannot produce cortisol after prolonged exposure to stress ) to which I am still recovering. \n\nI am so thankful to my partner for being so supportive and to my manager who went to bat for me and kept me in the loop with what was going on. She also helped me with my WorkSafe BC claim which was approved.\n\nIt’s now two months later and though I am still recovering I have began to get my health back. I unfortunately have to get surgery on my hand for my carpal tunnel but I have dropped the weight and I am helping my hormones get back to normal.\n\nI just enrolled in art school for the fall after my surgery. This whole experience made me see that life is too precious to be miserable in a job you hate that undervalues you . My health and happiness are more valuable than anything. \n\nI don’t want to end up unwell and unhappy like most of my peers were in that office and I will never make the mistake of sacrificing for a boss that wouldn’t do the same for me.\n\nI hope to one day become an art therapist and help others heal from the traumas they have experienced that hold them back from their own happiness. \n\nI hope my story can help others that are stuck in toxic jobs - leave before your body makes you ! \n\nAll the best to you!",

Science heavy, data analysis, challenging, I get to wear a lab coat and work with uranium.\n\nI don't have a manager. I'm trained by my coworkers/team. I don't report to anyone.\n\nSounds good, right?\n\nThen there's \"Head of HR\". One woman circus. No subordinates. No bosses. Biggest office in the building. Loves the sound of her own voice. Has a serious stick up her ass. Roams the hallways, ordering folks who are chatting with each other to get back to work. Will stand behind you while you work to make sure youre doing your job fast enough and to her standards. Lives, eats, and breathes punishment. Not a single nice thing has ever come out of this woman's mouth. Critical of the way you walk, talk, hold the phone, park, etc. \n\nShe disallowed us from drinking *water* at our desks. *Water*. We aren't allowed water anywhere but the break room, and if we're seen in the break room not on our lunch break, we're immediately terminated. People say they drink from the sink in the bathroom.\n\nHer husband is the company's president and owner. He's nowhere to be found.\n\nI've posted here about her before. She denied my request for accommodation to get occasional screenings and procedures done since i'm in remission of cancer. She said me taking any time off was undue hardship for the company.\n\nI don't get any type of PTO or healthcare, and requests for a day off are denied if they aren't made more than 60 days in advance. She smirked and chuckled when talking about the amount of people she's fired over this policy.\n\nI asked for sound-proof headphones for my autism. She said no because I would die in a fire if I didn't hear the alarm.\n\nI asked for a flexible schedule for doctor's appointments. She said if I was sick enough to miss work and see a doctor more than once every 2 months, I shouldn't be working. \n\nShe called employees who were parents of young kids 'breeders' and called their children 'shit stained screamers'. Said she wasn't afraid to fire people due to their parental obligations.\n\nShe will walk around taking notes and tapping her foot.\n\nShe doesn't believe in written communication, just oral. (Probably because she doesn't want a paper trail of the terrible shit she says).\n\nI've been there for a WEEK AND A HALF. AND I'M TERRIFIED OF THIS WOMAN.\n\nShould I run far far far away? I know i'll never find the optimal manager for my needs, but I have rights!\n\nHonestly, the glassdoor employee reviews were right. It is a total nightmare.",

    "text": "Got my dream job. HR woman made very clear her opinions on disabled people and denies all requests for reasonable accommodations. I'm disabled. Her husband is the president of the company. How do I navigate this after this shocking exchange? I posted here not even a week ago that I got my dream job after 9 months of turmoil. Now it's becoming a nightmare. Why is it that every person i've ever met in HR clearly SHOULD NOT be in HR?\n\nI'm fully aware that their job is to manage employee relationships with the company (or.. something). I know that she's not there to be 'on my side'. But today, I was blown away by how clear she made that.\n\nFirst off, I'm disabled (thanks, god!). I have a fun list of disabilities, most of them non-visible, that make work environments very difficult. I have CPTSD, Borderline Personality Disorder with situational psychosis, Schizophrenia, Tremors with Tardive Dyskinesia (stiff joints, lowered dexterity, shaky parkinson's like movements with uncontrollable muscle spasms) from complications with medicines, Depression, Anorexia, and a sleep disorder.\n\nThat being said, I'm doing absolutely great! A cocktail of medicines keep me alive. I'm a healthy weight, I'm getting better sleep than i've had in years, I haven't had a hallucination in 2 years, and my psychosis has turned 'micro'. What I find the most difficult to deal with is the tremors. It takes me a while to initiate writing because my dumbass brain can't make that connection, but once I get into it I'm pretty alright. It's even legible! It is also the only disability I have which is visible. I move my jaw around, open my mouth, kick, thump, and  shake uncontrollably. When it's at its best, I just look like i'm a little bit weird. When i'm at my worst, I can't walk, type, or breathe easily.\n\nMy PTSD and borderline are terrible, though. Loud noises scare the shit out of me, and I become a blubbering idiot when confronted or asked to defend myself from perceived threats. \n\nI've made many strides to become as successful as I have been. I'm very proud of what i've done [(humblebrag)](https://imgur.com/a/6hAFMob) \"despite\" my disabilities. I have struggled with most of my illnesses in silence, only developed TD and tremors in the last year, and don't look disabled. I decided I needed to ask for reasonable accommodations to help me have an optimal work experience so i'm as productive as possible.\n\nFirst, I emailed HR and asked to speak with them via email about reasonable accommodations because I would like to have it in writing. I simply asked if we could proceed in the discussion once I get my doctor's requests in, but was notifying them that I indeed had a disability and would be asking for REASONABLE accommodations.\n\nI'm on my second day of work. The HR woman comes to my desk, says \"We gotta talk.\", and takes me to a small office. She opens with \"whats this about a disability and accommodations? We need to talk about this now before you can continue working.\" \n\nI explain that I have a couple disabilities, none of them severely impacting the quality of my work enough to not have the job, but decided it was time I discuss with HR maybe a couple of things that would optimize my production. \n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I'd like noise buffering headphones\"\n\n\"So you can listen to music? I don't think so.\"\n\n\"There are headphones made for disabled folks that aren't electric. They buffer outside noise like office chit-chat and make it much less distracting.\"\n\n\"What if I need to call you and you can't hear the phone ring?\"\n\n\"It doesn't cancel out the noise, it just lowers the decibel to make auditory processing more manageable.\"\n\nShe sits back and sighs. \"Is that it?\"\n\n\"I'd also like to know the company's policy on flexible scheduling. For instance if i'm having an episode in the morning, I might not be able to come in for a few hours, but would stay late to make it up. Is this an opti-\"\n\n\"absolutely not. We don't have supervisors here after 5. You can't just pick and choose when you want to work. This isn't Avon. We hired you to work 40 hours a week for 5 days a week. We have customers that rely on our business to survive! If I can't rely on you to be here during the day, then this job isn't for you! If you start showing up to work late every day, am I supposed to just overlook it because of a disability? What will  other people think? And you're not wearing headphones at work. If there's an emergency or a fire alarm, there is a risk you could not hear it and die. If you start wearing headphones then everyone will come to me asking to wear headphones and that's not reasonable. I can't trust that you'd not be talking on the phone through those things! Everything is electric now-a-days! I don't see the point in those things. Seems like a bunch of crap to me. What's the point if you can't hear anything around you?\"\n\nI was shocked. The office music, talking, phone calls, and background noise is completely overwhelming to someone with PTSD. And not to mention, noise cancelling headphones are covered on the reasonable accommodation job help official government page for the ADA. I really didn't know what to say. I got flustered. \n\n\"I would have liked to talk about this over email.\"\n\n\"Would that have been easier for your disability? We have to talk about this one way or another, and I, quite frankly, operate better face to face.\"\n\nI had no idea if she was trying to jab at me or not. Was she trying to get on my level and see where she was coming from? Why was this so suddenly about her and the way she \"operates\"?\n\n\"It would have been easier, yes. I don't expect to be late to work more than maybe one or two days a month.\"\n\n\"We are all late one to two days a month, what does that have to do with being disabled? I get sick sometimes and cant show up for work every once in a while but i'm not about to go ask to show up whenever I please because of it.\"\n\nIt clicked. This lady has something against disabled people. Full stop. She doesn't believe any accommodation is reasonable because she's jealous of their protected status. I gave up. I told her I no longer was considering the accommodations, and that I valued my job and the company, etc. She claps her hands together and says \"I'm glad we're on the same page! Lets get back to work.\"\n\nI love my new job. I started really second guessing my need for these things. I know my job would be so much easier with the accommodations, but I just don't think it's worth it now. I don't get sick or annual leave or healthcare until 90 days with the company, so these occasional instances when I have episodes are so infrequent that I guess I can just call in to work and not get paid?\n\nThis exchange was so incredibly shocking. She clapped back with every request that I made. Telling me that it was an essential job function to be able to hear the telephone at full volume would have been one thing, but insulting disabled folk's aides was going WAY too far.\n\nNote that all exchanges were typed here to the best of my recall, and are word-for-word for most of it.\n\nWhat the fuck do I do?",

    "text": "Is this normal? Okay this is a lot to read and I'm on mobile so sorry if it looks weird or something. For context I work a shitty part time job at somewhere that could be considered fast food but idk if it counts and am still in high school. So I caught a really nasty head cold from my boyfriend and started feeling it Saturday the 17th and had a low grade fever. I text my manager (who I knew before I started working there, not sure if that's relevant) telling her I had a fever and she told me to text my other manager and she let me know the regional manager will be calling me the next day and that I'm not allowed to go into work which is fine and I scheduled a covid test for the very next day. The next day my RM calls my phone in the morning and she just kinda rambles to me about how I need to be symptom free for 24 hours or have a negative covid test which I get obviously and right after she texts me with a link to a survey I have to fill out every single day with my symptoms and days if I don't do it I'll be out longer so I just fill it out and every single day she texts me to remind me. Well this woman sent me on some wild goose chase for what she called a \"long form\" for the covid results? I called the minute clinic and CVS and everybody and NOBODY knew what she was talking about. Well around Tuesday night I get a negative covid test as expected and I tell her and she has me email her the pdf and everything and that was it, no telling me if I can go to work or anything so I'm like okay and the next day she texts me and she's like \"how you feeling?\" And I tell her I have a nasty head cold and she asks me if I have a sinus infection and I'm like \"I hope not\" and the next day (yesterday) she asks the same thing (am I feeling okay) and I'm like not by much and she goes \"Wow. Did you call the doctor ? This is a long time \" so idk what to say I'm just like \"I don't really get sick often but when I do it's bad, if you need me to work tomorrow I probably can\" and she said exactly \"You cannot come to work until you are symptoms free 24 hours.  When you are - I will get a statement from you and we will send to the committee to get released\". Well today she texts me while I'm in class at 8am and I don't respond so 20 minutes later she calls me so I ignore it and text her that I am in class and have lingering symptoms since she asked and she just goes \"Ok. Complete form. You have to be symptom free and we will continue to do health checks until symptom free\" and so I fill out the form with congestion, fatigue, and coughing (the same 3 things I've had this whole time minus a few other things like fever and body aches) and so she calls me about an hour or two ago while I'm eating dinner with my family saying \"well you said you were feeing better, why do you still have the same symptoms?\" And I'm just so annoyed I feel like I'm being harassed. this whole time I still have one of my managers asking me if I'm coming into work and seeming annoyed when I say I can't but it's like I literally can't don't be mad at me!!! I've been thinking about quitting (half the people that were there when I started in December have since you and some people don't even last a week) and I don't even know how to go about quitting because it's my first job and they're short staffed to begin with and I've made friends there so I'll feel mean but like this place is the worst and I've had so many weird experiences like one of the shift leaders refusing to show me where the silent alarms are because she didn't want me pressing them and a customer making me cry and then waiting outside until I got out of work and stuff like that it's just so tiring and I hate it there",

    "text": "Fired from McDonald’s Hi, I started working at 2 star McDonald’s because I needed the money, when I got there they were rude and unprofessional and didn’t train me and called me in for orientation and interview the same day. People were getting frustrated with me because it was my first job and I didn’t know how to work anything with no training, I talked to the manger at a McDonald’s closer to my house and he said leave there ASAP they're rude and they don’t train or do anything right. I struggle with anxiety so I struggled to quit especially with people who looked rude, acted rude and were unapproachable. They told me to look at my co-workers to teach me and see what to do and what not to do, I thought it was okay to use your phone because my co-workers were and I was never told not to but I didn’t want to do it in front of customers like my co-workers, so I just went into the bathroom and this woman saw me upset when I went in there so she followed me in there and waited like 10 minutes to say anything then asked if I was okay, I said yes, I just have a family emergency my mom is in the hospital she’s very sick from kidney damage. She says okay, come back to work so we can put you on your break when you’re done using the bathroom and fixing that. I said okay. When I came out this whole other man said he was sending me home and I said okay. I didn’t know what that meant at that time. I went to work the next day and did all my work, even other people’s work and did extra. I suffer from extreme menstrual cramps so every time my period starts I have to go to the gyno to make sure everything is okay, It started and my gyno wanted me to come in and said to ask if I can go in work later and this was urgent because it was not on time. I told my manager what she had said and said if she still wants me to come in to work I can totally do that and hold off the doctor. She said I was unreliable and chose my health over work so she was going to fire me. I told almost everyone about me getting fired because I was so mad at the time, I told my little sister and my older brother, my older brother decided to prank call them and my little sister did it along with him even when I told them do not say a word to them to save me the embarrassment. They called back my brothers number and said they knew who it was because they don’t get prank calls and only one person got fired today then they started cursing at her and saying rude things to her (they thought she was me but I was just in the background listening). I have to go in for my check and to return my uniform and my siblings have completely and utterly embarrassed me, should I still go in or send someone else? They literally think my sister was me because I’m the only one who got fired meanwhile it was just me being an idiot and having no pride and telling people I got fired. I didn’t see anything wrong with being fired simply because I hated the job, was overworked and had 0 training on my 3rd day. I’m still in 8th grade btw.",

As the doctor was asking questions about her medical history, I helped her answer as she could barely speak through her contractions, such as “she has a history of wisdom teeth surgery, right (PT name)?”  after she got her epidural and was more comfortable, I left the bedside to go to the nurses station, where the charge nurse proceeded to tell me how the doctor was complaining the patient wouldn’t make conversation with him.\n\n\nWhat?\n\nApparently my patient was so “unfriendly” towards him.  \n\nBRO. THIS WOMAN WHO IS IN LABOR, DOING ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS A PERSON HAS TO DO, DOESN’T OWE YOU A FUCKING CHIT CHAT!!!!!! she can’t even breathe through the pain let alone talk about the fucking weather. \n\nEnd of rant.",

    "text": "If you live in Texas I hope you're on birth control. **EDIT 5: It seems every comment with links to helpful resources and information is slowly getting removed. I will do my best to compile a list of links at the bottom of this post. Mods, what's up with this?**\n\n\nAbortions banned after 6 weeks with extremely rare exceptions. We're looking at lawsuits and ( **EDIT: Have been made aware I was confusing this part with the Abolition Abortion bill, it is correct jail time is not on the table yet with SB8**) ladies, nothing about the men here, except they can sue us for this as well; I guess telling us what to do with our bodies isn't enough! Texas is even pushing for bills that go as far as to give a woman the death penalty for an illegal abortion, but this has not passed *yet*.\n\n\nSeriously though, with the Republican majority in the Surpreme Court and this being passed in Texas, they soon will try even harder to put more restrictions on birth control and things like plan b. If you want to avoid the headache of being sued ~~and jailed~~ for an abortion, for any reason (the bill makes no exception for rape or incest!), take your pills, get your rings, shots, implants, IUD, tubes tied, whatever your choice is NOW before we can't. You can order plan b on Amazon much cheaper, and there's plenty of online doctors willing to get you birth control at an affordable price without insurance. If you want your tubes tied keep advocating for yourself until you find a doctor that will do it for you. \n\nAnd most importantly talk to your husbands/boyfriends about this. Discuss what they can do to help; It's unfair this bill puts the responsibility of the pregnancy 100% on the woman. Discuss your options if you were to get pregnant. Start tracking your periods and ovulation cycles. There is definitely apps for that. I'm serious. You'll thank me for it later. \n\n\nScrew you Greg Abbott.\n\n\n*Edit: Thanks everyone for the interactions and awards. Please educate yourself on how you can prevent an unwanted pregnancy, as well as the many resources that are online to help get you what you need (birth control, implants, plan b, IUDs, ect). This bill goes into effect in September unless it is (hopefully) striked down. Your body is your right and we should always support each other as women. I appreciate the support from the men as well! Also, thank you to the trolling hate DM kind Redditor! I won't be engaging with that :)*\n\n*Edit 2: HOLY GUACAMOLE YA'LL. The support is overwhelming, I'm happy to see how many of us have eachothers backs ❤ I was so frustrated with this today and truly didn't think this would blow up; I was venting and just holy cow. You are all so amazing and awesome. There's a ton of great information in this thread for anyone who needs it! I'm glad this is gaining traction because even my own mother didn't know this had happened until I told her. And for anyone living in Texas, other than protect yourself, vote. Vote these people out, be loud about it, and always advocate to your rights to your body. For those looking to leave Texas, I don't blame you lol. Thank you so much to everyone!! ❤❤❤*\n\n**EDIT 3: I can't see any new comments from within the hour (it's almost 9pm here). I've also corrected my wording and I did have two different bills confused; however the matter still stands as is; abortions are outlawed past 6 weeks and we can be sued, doctors can lose their licenses and clinics. There are proposed bills to have penalties such as prison time and the death penalty, but these have not been passed yet. My biggest advice is to VOTE and always protect your sexual organs. I apologize for any confusion; either way this is still outrageous**\n\nEdit 4: Uhm, hello r/all. This is intensifying my social anxiety but anything to get the word out there.\n\n\n\nLinks:\nhttps://aidaccess.org/\n\nhttps://thepillclub.com/\n\nhttps://thesatanictemple.com/pages/texas-lawsuit\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Plan-B-One-Step-1-tablet/dp/B00H2D6WUA (morning after pill for under 165 lbs)\n\nhttps://www.cvs.com/drug/ella (morning after pill for over 165 lbs)",

    "text": "THINGS EVERY WOMAN SHOULD KNOW ABOUT HER BODY I've met alot of women in my life who were unaware about various things about the female body, myself included. As a teenager, there were alot of things I've learned that I thought was true, only to realize it isn't.\nI wanted to make a post to share things I've learned over the years, and debunk myths.\nThis is mostly aimed at teenage girls/young women. But who knows! Maybe you learn something new aswell, even if you don't fit that category.\n\nIf you have anything you want to add, feel free to do so in the comments!\n\n\n**PEE AFTER SEX**\nPeeing after sex can help to flush bacteria out of the urethra, and therefore help avoiding an UTI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Sex shouldn't hurt your first time**\nPeople make having sex with men as a woman for the first time sound like a complete horror story.\nBut I'm happy to say, it's not!\nIt's normal to feel a little sore afterwards, but it's not supposed to be painful.\nDon't rush it, have fun with eachother. Make out, touch eachother, etc. \nIf it's difficult to insert the penis or if it's painful, leave it be, and do some more foreplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Your vagina is self-cleaning**\nVaginas are self cleaning. You never need to clean the inside of your vagina with water, soap or any other feminine hygiene products. \nThe vulva can be cleaned with a gentle unscented soap if this doesn't irritate you, but can contribute to recurrent yeast infections or Bacterial Vaginosis for some people.\nUsing water alone to clean your vulva is what is recommended by medical professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Having stains on your clean underwear is normal**\nThe vagina has a acidic pH level, that's why discharge can leave stains on your underwear. It's completely normal, and that doesn't mean your underwear isn't clean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Semen can mess up your vaginas pH-level**\nThe optimal vaginal pH level is between 3.8 and 4.5, which makes it acidic. \nSemen and soap have an alkaline pH, in the 7-9 range.\nBecause of this, the presence of semen can elevate your vaginal pH long after sex.\nIf you often have problems with UTIs after having sex, this may be the reason why.\nThe best way to deal with this is using a condom.\n\nEDIT:\nLubed condoms can actually mess with your pH levels aswell.\nMany popular brands of lube/condoms can irritate the vagina due to it's pH level.\n\n- If a product is CE marked, it’s a confirmation that it’s safe for the bodily environment it was intended for, by European Economic Area (EEA) standards. Without this, there’s no confirmation that your lube product doesn’t contain anything that’s harmful to your vulva skin and vaginal pH.\n- Avoid lubes/condoms that have flavors/fragrances such as fruity, floral, candy, etc.\n- Avoid: Glycerin(e), Propylene Glycol, Nonoxynol 9, Chlorhexedine Gluconate, Petroleum Oils, Polyquaternium-15, Benzocaine, Sugars & Sugar Alcohols, Ureas.\n\nThank you u/DiabloStorm for informing me about this!\nHere's a guide about everything to do with lube, I highly recommed it: http://dangerouslilly.com/lube-guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**80% of women don't orgasm from penetrative sex**\nCan't seem to reach an orgasm during penetrative sex? You're definitely not alone!\nThe vast majority of women are only able to orgasm from clitorial stimulation, the clit is the only thing on the human body that exists for pleasure only, after all, experiment with it!\nDon't accept that sex is done when he reaches an orgasm, when he didn't even try to pleasure you aswell.\nYour pleasure is just as important as theirs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Most women don't bleed their first time**\nIn some cultures, a husbands family demands to see bloody sheets after the wedding night, to prove that the bride was a virgin. This is false.\nOnly 1 in 5 women bleed their first time, I didn't bleed the first time I had sex.\nBleeding or not doesn't prove if the women has or hasn't had sex before.\nQuick note: If you're a woman who needs to prove her \"virginity\" by showing bloody sheets on her wedding night, and you're worried that you won't bleed, please DM me. There are multiple ways you can fake bleed, I can help you. Surgery is the worst thing you can do, there are different options that are much better!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Nobody can look inside your vagina and determine if you've had sex or not**\nThere have been cases of people taking their girlfriends/daughters/wives to a gynecologist to see if they have stretched their hymen or not.\nLike the rapper T.I, who took his 18 year old daughter to a gynecologist to get answers.\nThe truth is that no doctor or gynecologist can examine you to see if you've had sex or not, that's something only you know.\nThe hymen can stretch from doing everyday things, running, sports, riding a bike, etc. It has nothing to do with proving if you've had sex or not, it's just impossible to prove that. Some women are born without a hymen.\nPlease don't be discouraged to do sports and other things to avoid streatching your hymen.\nThere's help out there for women who need to prove their \"virginity\" to their boyfriend/father/husband this way. No person should ever do that to you. Please DM me if you're in that situation, I will more than gladly help you.\nVirginity is a made up concept to make people feel ashamed about their sexual experiences or lack there of. Again,  nobody can determine if you've had sex or not.\n\nEDIT:\nThank you u/Chickiri for posting this great and informative comment:\n\n\"While it's not possible to tell wether you're a virgin or not based on the state of your hymen alone, there are ways to detect wether or not you've had sex, which are especially important in the case of rape. If you've been raped/fear you've been raped (if you feel like maybe you've been drugged/intoxicated/any other situation), please seek a professional: this is very important for your health, and for any legal action you might want to take.\"\n\nThis is very important, it's completely understandable if you're afraid to report it. But please go to the hospital first thing, don't shower or change clothes. They will help tremendously, and they won't force you to report if you don't want to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Having large labia minora is normal**\nLabiaplasty is getting more and more popular amongst young women, because they feel like their vulva is \"abnormal\".\nIt isn't, every single vulva is normal. There is not a \"right\" way for a vulva to look. \nThere's a woman and activist called mediclit on twitter, she got a labiaplasty at 18. The procedure left her mutilated, and she no longer have any feeling in her clitoris. If you're interested in this topic, I suggest checking her out.\nPlease be safe!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**It's totally normal for one boob to be bigger than the other**\nIt's way more common to have asymmetrical boobs than have symmetrical ones. It's actually very rare to have perfectly symmetrical boobs, don't worry about it!\nThat being said, if you suddenly develop asymmetry, like a sudden increase or decrase in volume of the boobs, you should get that checked out. That’s especially true if that change comes with other symptoms like skin retraction, or thickening, dimpling, or a change in color of your breast. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**You can get pregnant during your period**\nIt's very unlikely, but it's not impossible.\nOnce inside a woman, sperm can wait for an egg for up to a week. Ovulation can occur soon after, or even during, the bleeding phase of a woman's menstrual cycle, giving the sperm the chance to get lucky. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**The vagina does not become \"loose\" if you have alot of sex**\nEver wondered why men say a woman who've slept with a 100 men have a \"loose\" vagina, but a woman who slept with the same man a 100 times doesn't? Me too!\nThis is simply a slut-shaming tactic, it isn't true. \nVirginity is a social construct, and who many people you've sex with is nobodys business, and it doesn't determine your worth.\nThe vagina can push out an entire baby and go back to its normal size, a dick won't change shit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Birthcontrol isn't only for avoiding pregnancy**\nI had very painful periods as a teenager, had all horrible sideeffects you could think of.\nMy mom suggested that I tried birthcontrol. Her suggestion made me feel embarrassed, I associated birthcontrol with having sex, and I hadn't had sex before at that age.\nShe explained that you can go on birthcontrol even if you aren't sexually active, and she's absolutely right.\nThere's many reasons why a woman would choose to go on birthcontrol, preventing pregnancy is only one of many.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Penetrative sex isn't the only way to have sex**\nThis annoys me alot. As a bisexual woman, I've been asked numerous times how two women have sex. They never ask how two men have sex, why? Because a dick is involved.\nThis is especially irritating considering that only 20% of women are able to orgasm that way.\nTo clarify, sex isn't just being able to orgasm either. But it annoys me that many men totally ignore the part that makes women reach climax, and won't even consider it sex.\nSex is so much more than just penetration, have fun with it, explore.\n\n\n\n\n**Vaginal discharge 101**\nI used Mama Doctor Jones video about discharge to provide pictures to better show what I mean. Thank your everybody who suggested her channel in the comments, very informative, and I highly recommend checking her out, you can find her video [here] (https://youtu.be/KHF8mB_8LUM)\n\nDischarge is a completely normal bodily function that cleans and protects the vagina.\nYour vaginal discharge can vary depending on your cycle, and it can vary from person to person.\nSome of us have alot, some of us have less, it's completely normal.\nI do not recommend wearing pantyliners on a daily basis to prevent getting discharge on your underwear, it can irritate the skin of the vulva. \n\n**Healthy/Normal discharge**\nThe color of vaginal discharge more commenly white or off-white, but sometimes it can have a bit of a yellow hue, and sometimes it can have a more transparent look.\n[Here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHfQyZ.jpg) are some examples of normal consistencies and colors of discharge.\n\n*In the absence of any other symptoms*, these consistencies are completely normal:\n\n- Watery/Clear\n\n- Gel-like \"stringy\" discharge, normally happends before ovulation.\n\n- Also consistencies that I included in the photo.\n\nYour discharge may be a brownish color, this is also normal, reference photo [here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHDEfo.jpg)\nThis is called spotting.\nSpotting is defined as light vaginal bleeding that happens outside of your regular periods.\nThis kind of brown discharge can often happend at the end of your cycle. It's old blood mixed with discharge, which creates a brown-like color.\n\n**Abnormal discharge**\nFirst of all, it's important to recognise how your discharge usually smell like. It shouldn't smell foul, but it's normal to have a smell or lack of it. If it does have a funny smell, it's a sign that you should get it checked up.\n\nCottage cheese-like chunks in your vaginal discharge, looks like [this] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHlZIV.jpg)\n\nThis can often signify a yeast infection.\nEspecially if it's followed by any of these symptoms:\n\n- Genital Itching \n\n- Swelling\n\n- Redness \n\n- Burning sensation while peeing or having penetrative sex\n\n- Your discharge might smell a little \"off\" if you have a yeast infection, but it can also have no odor at all.\n\n\nTREATMENT:\nIf it's your first time having an yeast infection, or if you're unsure if it is an yeast infection or not, make an appointment to your doctor.\n\nOtherwise, you can buy a over-the-counter yeast treatment. (Not recommended for pregnant women, book an appointment)\nIf your symptoms persists, book an appointment.\n\nDon't be embarrassed if you have a yeast infection, it's very common but unpleasant. Don't be afraid to seek treatment.\n\nTo reduce your risk of vaginal yeast infections: \n\n- Wear underwear that has a cotton crotch and doesn't fit too tightly.\n\nAvoid:\n\n- Tight-fitting pantyhose\n\n- Douching, which removes some of the normal bacteria in the vagina that protect you from infection\n\n- Scented feminine products, including bubble bath, pads and tampons\n\nThe following may increase your likelihood of yeast infections:\n- Stress\n\n- Diabetes\n\n- Use of birth control pills\n\n- Pregnancy\n\n- Antibiotics, especially prolonged use over 10 days\n\n\n\n\nAlot of yellow discharge that looks like [this] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHs8JF.jpg) especially if you have other symptoms could indicate chlamydia.\nA slight yellow hue can be normal in certain situations. But if you feel other symptoms, or if you recently had sex with a new person, you should get that checked out.\nRemember! Some people don't have any symptoms when they have chlamydia. Untreated chlamydia can result in serious health complications, such as pelvic inflammatory disease.\nThat's why it's very important to use a condom when having sex, and get tested if you have any doubts.\n\nIf you suspect that you have any kind of STI or STDs, seek medical treatment.\n\nLime green discharge, that kinda looks like mucus in my opinion, reference [here]\n(https://pasteboard.co/JZHvzad.jpg)\nAnd [here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHvNlq.jpg)\nIf you have a new sexpartner or in any situation where you can be at risk for STI or STDs, this can indicate gonorrhea or trichomoniasis.\n\nSymptoms of trichomoniasis:\n- Itching, burning, redness or soreness of the genitals\n\n-Discomfort with urination\n\n-A change in their vaginal discharge (i.e., thin discharge or increased volume) that can be clear, white, yellowish, or greenish with an unusual fishy smell\n\nSymptoms of gonorrhea:\n- an unusual vaginal discharge, which may be thin or watery and green or yellow in colour\n\n- Pain or a burning sensation when peeing\n\n- Pain or tenderness in the lower abdominal area  (this is less common)\n\n- Bleeding between periods, heavier periods and bleeding after sex (this is less common)\n\nIf you suspect that you have any kind of STI or STD, seek medical attention.\n\nIf your discharge have a thin, gray color, it can indicate bacterial vaginosis. Couldn't find a good reference photo for this one, sorry about that.\n\nWhat is bacterial vaginosis?\nBacterial vaginosis is a type of vaginal inflammation caused by the overgrowth of bacteria naturally found in the vagina, which upsets the natural balance.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Grey-like discharge\n\n-Discharge have a strong fishy odor\n\n- Burning feeling when you pee\n\n- Itching\n\n50% of women do not have any symptoms.\n\nWhen to see a doctor:\n\n-You have vaginal discharge that's new and associated with an odor or fever. Your doctor can help determine the cause and identify signs and symptoms.\n\n- You've had vaginal infections before, but the color and consistency of your discharge seems different this time.\n\n- You have multiple sex partners or a recent new partner. Sometimes, the signs and symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection are similar to those of bacterial vaginosis.\n\n- You try self-treatment for a yeast infection with an over-the-counter treatment and your symptoms persist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)**\nTSS is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by bacteria getting into the body and releasing harmful toxins.\nThis can affect both men, women and children.\nRisk factors for toxic shock syndrome include skin wounds, surgery, and the use of tampons.\nHaving your tampons in for longer than 8-12 hours can increase the risk of an infection or TSS.\n\nSymptoms:\nThe symptoms of toxic shock syndrome start suddenly and get worse quickly. They include:\n\n- A high temperature\n\n- Flu-like symptoms, such as a headache, feeling cold, feeling tired or exhausted, an aching body, a sore throat and a cough\n\n- Feeling and being sick\n\n- Diarrhoea\n\n- A widespread sunburn-like rash\n\n- Lips, tongue and the whites of the eyes turning a bright red\n\n- Dizziness or fainting\n\n- Difficulty breathing\n\n- Confusion\n\nTSS is very rare, but these symptoms should absolutely not be ignored, if you experience these symptoms, contact medical emergencies immediately. If you're using a tampon while experiencing these symptoms, remove it straight away. Inform medical staff if have used a tampon while experiencing these symptoms.\n\n\n\nLike I said, feel free to add anything if I forgot about something.\n\nI hope you all have an amazing day!\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nThank you so much for the awards and positive comments. \nYour comments warms my heart, I'm so glad that many of you have found it helpful.\n\nSeeing that many parents show their daughters and sons my post makes me so incredibly proud of myself, you have no idea how much it means to me.\n\n\nI'm happy that many women and girls are comfortable  enough to DM me with questions about their body, questions that they're afraid to ask in real life.\nI'm very happy to answer questions to the best of my ability, but please remember that I'm not a medical professional.",

    "text": "My sister's fiance last minute called off their engagement after finding out that she will most likely not be able to have children naturally.. Seeing my sister process this has reminded me of how resilient women are when we need to be. One of my sisters (31f) got engaged last summer to the man she has been with for six years. My whole family loved him and of course were thrilled about the engagement. Starting in October, my sister began experiencing some issues with her period and severe cramping pain. She went to her doctor for routine testing. What she thought would be a quickly diagnosable and easily fixed health situation, turned into a lot more. After a few months of more invasive testing, she was told the news that she has a condition that will make her odds of getting pregnant naturally very, very low. Not impossible, but very low.\n\nWhen she called me crying, I booked a ticket that night to fly and see her. She is my best friend. I expected the visit to be full of long walks and sister time, with nights spent hanging out at her house with her fiancé, but once I arrived I realized that wasn't going to be the case. I got there a few hours after her fiancé had left. She told me he had shut down and told her he needed to go see his family for a weekend away to process the news. \n\nRather than being able to spend the weekend helping her begin to process significant personal news around her body and future pregnancy odds, we spent most of that first weekend processing her fiancé’s reaction.\n\nLong story short, her fiancé returned after the weekend and they spent a few weeks together before he ultimately called off the engagement. His reasoning was that going into marriage, he felt it was extremely important for him to know with certainty that he could make a family with his future wife naturally. He just couldn't in good faith go forward with the marriage with his new understanding of their odds (is what she told me he said). \n\nShe let him go without a fight or a bad word. I couldn't believe this (being stubborn and very pissed off myself by his behavior). But she told me that while she was devastated, his words gave her a lot of clarity: she had dodged a bullet not signing on to a life with a man who would run at the first sign of their life diverging from his expectations. She wanted someone who loved her through this kind of news. She didn't feel the need to tell him this. She just said goodbye and wished him happiness. \n\nNow, everyone is entitled to their own priorities for marriage. Do I understand how he could have found something out like that about a woman he had loved for six years, only to turn around and abandon her? No. Am I biased because we are talking about my sister who I am extremely protective of? Yes. This post isn't intended to spark negative conversation around my sister's ex-fiancé for his decision. Good luck to him.. It is intended to share my perspective around how insanely resilient my sister - and I am sure so many other women who face fertility challenges or called off engagements or marriages - are.\n\nMy sister told me that initially hearing that she may not be able to have a child of her own felt like  a core part of her self identity had suddenly been ripped away. She told me that she felt the most alone she ever has - and seeing her fiance shut down only added to that. But, she told me that within 48 hours of the doctor's appointment, she decided she wasn't going to let this deter her from moving forward happily. I have watched her first-hand over the past few months take ownership over addressing the hardest of emotions in the best way she can. She got an amazing therapist. She requested some time off from work to process. She coordinated a move across the country with poise and a big smile - choosing to let herself feel excited for a new beginning despite the pain she was feeling around the closure of her last chapter.\n\nMost importantly,  she has let me and my family - and her closest friends - support her. She has let me sit with her for hours in silence as she cries and processes in weaker moments. She has let me take her out for dinners where we drink too many margaritas and watch a terrible movie laughing at all of the terrible jokes. She has let me and others help temporarily fill some of the holes that were created by her pregnancy news and losing her fiancé. Holes that - as she so poignantly said - feel like trenches right now, but overtime will shrink. She has joined infertility support groups online, even meeting a few amazing women in person in our city who she says have helped her immensely. She went on a date last weekend and called me dying laughing after reflecting on how absurdly poorly the night went.\n\nAnyways, just wanted to share an example of how resilient women are. Even in the most challenging of situations, we can figure out the ways to move forward constructively and freely, taking a higher road. I also wanted to share how important it can be to let other women and people in to help when you are struggling. I know my sister would say the same.",

Last year I was diagnosed with cervical cancer, so far I have seen 4 oncologist, and the four have said the same thing, I’m to young to be going through this ( I’m 30) and I need to get a hysterectomy.\nI’m in Mexico and have free healthcare, that means not always I will have the same doctor on my case, today I was assigned a new doctor because the other one was going on vacation and he advised to do the surgery with this other one available, I said yes because I just want this nightmare to end.\n\nToday I when to my appointment to pick the day of my surgery and to meet the new doctor, he was an older guy and asked to speak with me alone, so I did, then explained the procedure (a hysterectomy plus other things) and everything about the surgery, everything was fine until he asked me if I had children and I said no. \n\nSo then he goes like:\n\nDr: so you haven’t had kids, this procedure will leave you sterile, are you aware?\n\nMe: yes, I know.\n\nDr: so are you sure you want to proceed with the surgery?\n\nMe: yes, of course.\n\nDr: well, I’m going to call your husband in, so I can explain this to him, then both can decide if you want to proceed.\n\nWtf?? I’m the one sick, why do I need my husbands opinion on this?? I was absolutely shocked, because I have read a lot of stories of woman not being able to sterilize themselves because they don’t want (more) children. But this? I have cancer!! I *need* this, it’s necessary, I dreamed to being a mom, I don’t want to, I *have* to do it.\n\nObviously I told him that my husband was aware of my sickness and treatment, and that I didn’t need his opinion or approval on this. He said ok and continued with the appointment as normal.\n\nSorry if this is not permitted, I just needed to vent.\n\nEdit: Formatting and,\nFor the people asking, my surgery is this Thursday, and thanks for all your good wishes and positive thoughts.\n\nEdit2: I understand that my husband should hear what is going on with me, but as I said this is the fourth doctor I see (all male), my husband already knows all the implications of my surgery, he already hear 3 times before yesterday, we were there just to choose a date for it. But this is the first doctor to ask me to discuss with my husband if he agrees with it, the first three doctor just asked him if he understood what was being said, but they never asked him if he agreed with me about doing the surgery. “Saving your life is what’s important right now” was said several times. That’s why I feel baffled about this doctor approach.\n\n\nAlso please understand this is to save my life. I not sterilizing me just because. I NEED this.",

    "text": "Britney Spears' conservatorship is the most extreme, heightened, distilled version of something that I think most women have experienced. That issue is misogyny in medical care and other professions.How many women have been patronized, ignored, and abused by medical professionals?\n\nUsually it's something like a doctor ignoring your pain, *even if it is the most extreme pain of your life,* because of course you are just a whiny, attention-seeking girl or woman with low pain tolerance and nothing is actually wrong with you.  \n\n\nOr it's a doctor doing shit like refusing to prescribe birth control pills to a teen or 20-something unless they get to stick their fingers in their vagina first, even though the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated 20 years ago that there is no medical need for pelvic exams to be performed on young women seeking hormonal birth control.\n\n  \nOr going to the ER while bleeding internally, and being made to wait 5 hours for a cat scan at the *EMPTY* ER, even though the blood is visually draining from your face and you are fainting when you stand, and your stomach is slowly growing more and more distended as the blood gathers in your abdominal cavity, because of course you are just a whiney girl who just has cramps or bad gas instead of, you know, a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst that is bleeding uncontrollably and will require emergency surgery and blood transfusions.  \n\n\nOr it's the psychiatrist who is re-diagnosing you with ADHD (re-diagnosing because the college you teach at doesn't believe that your ADHD diagnosis could be real and is making you get re-diagnosed by a second doctor) asking you how long you've been overweight before stating that there are cheaper diet pills than adderall, and saying that it is impossible to have ADHD and an advanced degree so you MUST be lying about one or the other.\n\n  \nOr it's the doctor who tries to make you pass a pulmonary functions test over and over again right after you spent a week on a ventilator, and doesn't believe that you can't blow the minimum force required, even though you also just spent over a month with one lung fully collapsed and you have a tumor pressing on a major nerve, causing all your muscles to spasm uncontrollably whenever you inhale deeply, and they refuse to prescribe you appropriate painkillers because \"there's nothing wrong with her chest\".\n\n  \nOr they strap you down to the bed when you have a ventilator in, and don't communicate to you what meds they are giving you, don't give you access to a call button, and don't give you a method of non-verbally communicating with the nurses and doctors even though you are fully lucid and aware of what is happening around you.  \n\n\nBritney was young and pretty. She was seen as girly and dumb, but she was also rich and sexualized.Then Britney shaved her head, and she hit a stalker's car with an umbrella when they wouldn't leave her alone. And she drove with her kid in her lap.And for that, they took away ***all of her rights, possibly for the rest of her life.***\n\nI can't help but think that part of this is that she was a young and pretty woman, so they saw her as a child. And being both sexualized and rich, they saw her as someone who doesn't follow certain norms/expectations, and therefore a threat.  \n\n\nWhat has happened to Britney is nothing short of a tragedy. The tiniest silver lining in this is that it has shown people how very real these issues are, by showing that *even one of the world's most famous pop stars* who has millions of dollars can be victimized this way, and effectively forced into slavery by the courts.  \n\n\nEdit:\n\nI'd like to thank user Esk313 for being the first to send me an inappropriate DM based on this post:\n\n\"Have you considered medication? Given you long list of ... 'complaints' as detailed in your post and your strong interpretations of the Britney Spears case, it really seems like your neuroses are getting the better of you. Take some time, step away from the internet. Focus on your mental health. Consider medication. Only you can take care of yourself.\"\n\nEsk313, not everything listed in the post happened to me personally, though they are all things that have happened to me *or* people I know personally. If you must know, I was recently an inpatient for cancer complications. I was on a ventilator from a re-inflation pulmonary edema after a massive pulmonary effusion - (tumors by my heart and lungs caused irritation that led to the lining of my lung filling with lymph fluid, until I had 84% of a gallon of fluid where my lung should be. When it was drained, the lung became extra permeable and began filling with liquid), and despite this I *still* had a nurse insisting that I was only in the ICU \"for attention\".   \nI also have a reduced response to opioids - I had a genetic test confirm this after I noticed it a few years ago, and yet it took several days of extreme pain, and me refusing to comply with further treatments before the hospital was willing to address the pain and switch to non-opioid pain medication.  \nBy assuming these issues are the result of unmedicated neurosis, you have reinforced the point I was making with the post.",

    "text": "The \"Husband Stitch\" So a few years ago my husband told me that the doctor who delivered his brother asked his dad if he wanted a \"couple of extra stitches thrown in there\" while her episiotomy was being closed. Of course I found this offensive and angering, and a joke in extremely bad taste. \n\nThis morning the topic came around again, and I mused that, back in the '70's, doctors might have actually *done* that shit. My husband scoffed at me and said \"No way,\" and I agreed. I was probably just being bitter bc his dad is a sexist asshole. (Ex: took pictures of other women in bikinis on a family vacation with the family camera, got them developed, and they're still in their photo box.) Out of curiosity, I decided to google \"husband stitch\" to reassure myself that it was an urban legend. \n\n**I was so. Fucking. Naive.**\n\nThe \"husband stitch\" was [totally](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/husband-stitch-is-not-just-myth#The-history-of-episiotomies,-from-popular-to-discouraged) [real.](https://granta.com/the-husband-stitch/) My husband and I just stared at each other open-mouthed for a second because it seemed like such an evil, misogynistic violation that it couldn't be real. But it is. \n\nFor those that don't know, the practice involves putting extra stitches in the vagina to make it \"tighter\" for the man's pleasure because men are still terrified that childbirth makes pussies loose. That's not true, and it also shouldn't be a fucking priority after you just had an infant. The practice can cause a host of complications for women, most frequently **pain during intercourse.** But that's a petty concern when compared to a man's right to fuck. This can affect husbands, too, because it really messes up their sex life. (Hope it was fucking worth it, asshole.)\n\nI took the practice to be separate from an episiotomy, which I thought was a medical procedure, but my husband made a great point: episiotomies used to be routine because they didn't want the vagina torn too much, and he asked me if I thought that was out of concern for the woman. \"No,\" he said, \"the interest in preventing tearing was **also** to keep the husband's vagina nice and tight and pretty looking.\" I had to admit that he was right. (And I was also secretly proud of him. I hit the man jackpot!) \n\nThe \"husband stitch\" is still performed today, and I truly wonder how many women even get asked or told about it.\n\nEven after being on the planet for 43 years, this practice still shocks the **fuck** out of me. One woman described \"laying there like a lump\" while the husband and doctor discussed the extra stitches, ignoring her completely. I always worry about being one of those stereotypical \"angry, man-hating\" feminists, but I'm so fucking tired of men thinking they have any amount of privilege or control over our bodies!!! This stitch shit is fucking crazy! \n\nIt's nothing but a subtle admission that a lot of men see women as non-sentient fuck-holes that only exist to pleasure them. Look at they way they flipped their shit about #MeToo, when it was made loud and clear that they don't just get free access to our bodies whenever it strikes their fancy. And i **know** women have it relatively good in America, but I can't believe that we still have this far to go. And to be brutally honest, I am finding it hard **not** to despise men just a little bit for thinking they're owed a tighter pussy because they were generous enough to let us have their baby. **Fuck that.**\n\nMy husband was appalled, too, but I really needed to rant at some fellow women. Thanks for putting up with me :) Stay safe and healthy out there!\n\nEdit: 20 seconds and the post gets downvoted. I'm gonna throw caution to the wind and assume it's a guy throwing a tantrum because he doesn't like being told that our bodies don't belong to him. How about that person simply respect us out of common fucking courtesy, since it's always the **obviously correct** choice, and just go on from there.\n\nEdit2: **STEPS TO TAKE TO PROTECT OURSELVES**: Fuck genital mutilation, ya'll! From what I have read, there are a couple of simple things we can do to avoid this bullshit:\n\n1. Find an OBGYN that you trust (good advice for all of us!)\n\n2.  Talk to them about how you would like your birth to go and try to establish some kind of plan. Keep it short and simple, say 3 of your most important thoughts. It's always helpful to bring an advocate with you (this is usually the husband if it's an obstetrics appt, but it can be anyone you trust and who knows what you want to achieve.)\n\n3. Ask the OBGYN **what their policy is regarding episiotomies.** Ask them how often they do them and how they decide that it's necessary. *Tell them you would prefer you don't have one if at all possible,* although sometimes they are needed in emergent situations. Use your voice, say that shit - doctors work for *you.*\n\n4. Tell them that you don't want the husband stitch, and if they try to laugh it off, tell them what you know about it and that it's a real thing. Don't let them intimidate you, you have the right to tell them what is and isn't acceptable. If you have an advocate or support, bring them too if it will help.\n\n5. This is unofficial, but I'm a nurse, so: **do your own research before your appointment. ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF**, because a lot of doctors (sorry if I offend, and I'm only speaking from *my* experience) are supercilious man-splainers that are used to having their ass kissed constantly. (And you should see the difference in the way most male doctors talk to female nurses vs. male nurses. But that's another post.) **Don't take that bullshit.** Ask them however many questions you want, make them explain anything you aren't sure you're solid on, ask about meds, ask about anesthesia, bring something to write on. If they order tests, ask them what they're for - doctors will order Bullshit tests to get a few extra bucks from your insurance. (I have seen this happen at nearly every floor I've worked on. It's especially bad if you have Medicare - they charge the fuck out of Medicare.) When it's all over, **ask for an itemized bill.** If something seems bogus, call the office and make them give you an explanation.\n\n6. Again: Use your voice. Advocate for yourself (and the rest of us ladies will benefit, too!) I can't say that enough. Don't let anyone blow you off or condescend to you, and don't leave until you have the information you want. **I love you guys! Stay safe and healthy and vaginally perfect out there!! I know it's painful And upsetting to read about this shit, but THIS IS HOW WE MAKE LIFE BETTER for ALL of us. You're amazing, and i believe in you!**\n\nEdit3: Guys, my inbox is freaking blowing up and i can't answer everybody. **Thank you so much for the awards and the kind words!** I was mortified by this and really needed to talk to some women (I've got some anxiety issues - but who doesn't after 2020), and you guys have helped me so much! Spread the word about this misogynistic fuckery to all the ladies you love of child-bearing years, and keep on being wonderful human beings! <3 <3\n\n**Edit 4: What can we do to raise awareness and hold doctors accountable?** I slept on this, and I have some ideas, but I also need your help. Here are my thoughts: I'm a member of the Satanic Temple, and they do a lot of activism regarding bodily autonomy. This issue seems to be right in their wheelhouse. They have funds and they have lawyers. I think it's worth it for me to email them about this - even if they don't pick it up right away, at least it will put the bug in their ear. I have a friend back in Boston who knows one of the ST founders, and i am going to get him to work this into a convo with Doug sometime. That's one way to raise awareness about this. But what else? How do we find women who have been victims of this? Do we set up a website where they can self report? Does anyone know how to do that, because I'm shit with that kind of thing. Are there any lawyers reading who could give advice? What do you guys think? Can we create a space where we can talk about/collaborate on this - maybe a Slack workspace or something? **What are your thoughts?**",

    "text": "I've had 3 abortions I've had 3 abortions.\n\nMy first abortion was when I was 18. My partner was using a condom that broke, but they never told me it did. I was not emotionally ready for a child. I had the abortion at 6 weeks 6 days\n\nMy 2nd abortion was when I was 19. After my experience at 18, I started taking birth control pills, and used a condom with a new partner. That condom broke. My partner immediately told me, and I breathed a sigh of relief because I knew I was taking pills. 6 weeks later I was 8 weeks between periods. I was not emotionally ready for a child. I had the abortion at 7 weeks 4 days.\n\nMy 3rd abortion was when I was 25. I was living in another country and thought I was absolutely in love with a man I met there. I found out he was cheating, with multiple women, and had lied about his background. At the same time of these other discoveries, I learned that I was pregnant and he moved to another city within days of me showing him the test results and had no way of contacting him. The one friend I had native to the country offered to help me. She took a day off of work (which is unheard of in this country) and took me to a medical facility. Her English fell short and my minimal understanding of the native language was utterly useless. I realized I was on morphine and escorted to a table with a black bagged trash can between the stirrups. The last thing I remember was a nurse kindly wiping my tears away while another told the doctor \"the foreigner is crying\". This was a devastating experience. I physically recovered quickly and my elderly neighbor brought me food for a week even though we couldn't communicate. Clearly my friend had asked her to check on me. I was not emotionally ready for a child nor did I want to have a child with a deceptive person. I had the abortion at 7 weeks and 4 days. (weirdly same as the 2nd)\n\nWhen I was 26, I was back in the States and was living with someone I'd known for years, who knew everything about my life, including the abortions, and loved me whole heartedly because the abortions do not define me or stain my character. We got pregnant. We were shocked, worried that we weren't ready, but knew we wanted to bring a child into the world together, and trusted ourselves to step up. Almost 8 months later, we brought our son home from the hospital.\n\nIf I was forced to suffer the failures of what sex-ed and frigid, uncommunicative parents taught me, I would not have been able to achieve any of my successes and my life (and the lives of any children forced to suffer my limitations) would be totally debilitated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to share my story because for so long I felt like this is a shameful part of my past. But you know what? I'm not ashamed anymore. I am so grateful for the choices I've been able to make. I am not promiscuous, I am not frivolous. I made choices based on whats right for me and now I make choices based on whats right for me and my family.\n\nI can't imagine being deprived of that choice.\n\n\\[this is a throw away account\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: **This community is amazing**. To those sharing your own experiences, thank you SO much for doing so. All of the kind comments and support GREATLY outweigh the negativity. The stigma surrounding abortion is a direct threat to a woman's wellbeing, safety, and their right to control their own life and body. It took a lot for me to write this post. I hope these experiences become easier for others to share, without feeling the need to do so through a throw away account. Be well.",

    "text": "Access to abortion services doesn't always mean just being able to fully terminate a pregnancy. Nearly 7 years ago, my husband and I began trying for our second child. I became pregnant very quicky (yay!), but almost immediately got so ill morning sickness I was in the hospital at what was estimated as 6 weeks to get IV because I was so dehydrated. I remember them telling us then that it was very unlikely due to the pregnancy, but I KNEW. \n\nAbout a week or so later we finally were able to get a first ultrasound. The technician calmly checked everything with the screen turned, my husband with me in the room. She then asked if we wanted to see, and as she turned the screen the words she said will forever echo in my mind \"so there are three babies\". I just looked at my husband and mumbled \"what did we do?!\". As much as we were prepared for one more child to complete our family, we were in NO WAY prepared for triplets. \n\nWe told my family. We didn't post anything on social media, but people knew. And during the next week my husband and I honestly discussed the issue. We wanted to speak to a specialist. We wanted to inquire about the possibility of reduction. I was so incredibly ill I could barely eat. Anything except orange juice made me completely ill. We were both worried for my own health. And we agreed years ago no babies life was worth giving my own, if we were in that circumstance. \n\nUnfortunately shortly before the pregnancy was confirmed my long time doctor retired. She was lovely. I was moved to a new young Doctor. She was nice, but she was immediately taken aback by our requests to speak to a specialist about our current risks and about the possiblity of a reduction. She reluctantly agreed, and set us up with an appointment with the foremost specialist on both issues (spontaneous triplets and reduction) in our province. I hate to say it took me until after I gave birth to finally move to a different (much better) doctor. \n\nWe met with the spcialist when I was around 10 weeks along. He gave us a large amount of information to review. And he was completely understanding with our thoughts on reduction. After a long talk with him and reviewing the information, we decided to reduce to twins. That would not only save me from imminent bed rest, at minimum, but also reduce the risks of mental and physical disabilities in the babies by over half. We had an older son to worry about, and we were in no financial position to have 3 babies at once. We scheduled the appointment for 12 weeks, a day surgery in the hospital (if anyone wants to talk about specifics please send me a message). \n\nWhat sucked was the fallout for the month after. My sister and mom ambushed me on the phone and said they would never help us with anything if we went through with it. My dad didn't talk to me at all. We stopped talking to anyone in my family. It wasn't until after the procedure when they saw both how much better my health was as well as finally took time to understood our choice (medically) that they finally showed acceptance and after time great love for our twins. My mom even cared for them part-time while I worked for a few years. \n\nOur twin boys turned 6 this past march. They are both happy, healthy, smart boys who will be going into grade 1 in the fall. And though it was absolutely 100% the hardest and worst decision of our entire lives, and I do still wonder about the possibly sibling we had to say goodbye to, it was the right decision for our family. And I cannot imagine where we would be right now, if I would even be alive right now, if we didn't have that choice to make and I wasn't able to get that procedure at 12 weeks.  \n\nMy heart breaks for every woman who is not able to ask for what we asked for and make the decision we were able to make.\n\nMORNING AFTER EDIT: Thank you all for your kind words, support, awards and sharing of your own stories. The more we can share our own experiences the louder our voices get to drown out those who try to take this body anonymity away from us. <3 to ALL my sisters\n\nFINAL EDIT: To anyone curious, yes all three of our sons know what we had to do. The twins are still a bit young to understand, but I made it very clear that when we did this we would never pretend like it never existed. I will keep its photo forever to remind us of the sacrafices we made for our family and to remind us how lucky we are to be where we are today.",

When I was 9 years old, I went to multiple doctors that told my parents I was faking being sick to get out of school or that it was all in my head. All male doctors. The 7th doctor, female doctor, I saw decided to do a blood draw only to find out it was a ruptured appendix. I was rushed to surgery and told afterwards that I had less than a week to live when they caught it. \n\nI was a mess and this left alot of scar tissue in me. I had some pain due to scar tissue after the surgery but was too afraid of doctors to tell anyone. Over the next 15 years complications increased, including terrible back pain. \n\nI got married right before starting grad school. I gave birth control a shot but it made me super depressed so I got off of it. While I was on it, the scar tissue decided to stick together more. When I got off birth control and my body tried to go back to normal, the scar tissue strangled part of my reproductive system. I saw 4 doctors before one suggested we do investigative laproscopic surgery. That is when they discovered that my body had strangled my reproductive system. They loosened it as best as they could. Loosening the scar tissue did resolve my back pain which means scar tissue was pushing on a nerve for over half my life. \n\nDuring the strangulation inside me, my hip flexer cramped up. As you can imagine it wad very hard to do anything for months. So after the scar tissue was loosened, I was good except that my hip flexor was still tight not able to get blood flow. For 2 years I had extreme pain, nausea, and suicidal thoughts (while getting a PhD). Went to multiple doctors and specialist. All guys by the way. No one knew what to do with me, which was so depressing and hard. Finally a woman nurse suggested massage therapy and physical therapy. Today I am on the road to recovery and almost pain free for the first time in 18 years. Just in time to finish my degree pain free and begin to live a pain free life with my loving and supportive husband.",

    "text": "Girls grow up and become women who fear losing their rights, men mostly don’t and thus don’t understand. I know this sounds something that everybody already seems to know, but that realisation hit me two days ago and I cannot get it out of my head and I feel I’m getting more and more angrier about it.\n\nMany here have probably either watched or heard about the TV show that deals with women’s place in a dystopian world, based on a book (I’m not sure if I’m allowed to say the title). Well, I finally watched the last two seasons after being completely distraught when I watched the first two seasons and needed to distance myself. It was in the middle of the previous US presidency and everything just felt too gloomy and I couldn’t watch it, so I did it now and it made me want to discuss the show in length. \n\nI spoke with someone who is dear to me, who is pro-women and pro-women’s rights and who happens to be male. \n\nAnd he told me that he doesn’t see how these things could happen or would happen in the place where we live right now, which isn’t the US, but it is in Europe. \n\nTo say that we had a disagreement over this topic would be an understatement. Despite everything I said, all the examples I brought out - both from modern and historic - he was pretty adamant that it wouldn’t happen where we were and if the first signs were there “women should protest” and I felt like everything I tried to explain about the book, the series, the *whole point* just flew past his head. Because he couldn’t even entertain the thought that this could happen where we were, even with women protesting and disagreeing with this.\n\nAnd it made me realise that I, as a woman, have grown up to know that my rights aren’t given, that I need to support expanding those rights and that even when these rights have been achieved, one has to be loud and ensure that the rights are being kept as they’ve been achieved. And men... just haven’t. He’s never had to worry that a doctor will think he’s being hysterical or overwhelmed. He’s never had to seriously worry that he won’t be listened to. He doesn’t even entertain the thought that someone would not allow him to use his own hard earned money or not allow him to have a bank account, because that’s what happens in dictatorships and we live in modern times. \n\nAnd it makes me so angry, even now, two days later, because I see the book and the TV show as a warning of what might happen if fundamental religiousness is allowed to control the society or adherence to restrictive societal expectations of women can lead to remaking of society and for him it’s all fictional. Never mind that the examples are there even from modern times! Never mind that we have people who practice extreme religiousness within their own lives and there are women who are subjugated, against their will, to these rules even today and now. Nope, not gonna happen. \n\nAnd he’s a good guy - educated, pro-women, pro-choice, gender equality et cetera. There are so many who believe in even less. It just makes me both sad and mad and I feel like the only people who understand *why* the show and book freak me out are.... other women. \n\nIdk why I wanted to post this, his reaction has made me rant about men and their perception of the world and thinking that their heads are in clouds sometimes.",

    "text": "What my violent ex-husband learned at a court-required anger management course TL;DR: >!When my violent ex-husband went to an anger management course after he assaulted me, he learned that if you tidy up all the evidence of having beaten your wife, the police will believe you, not her. This turned out to be correct and kept me trapped with him for an additional year.!<\n\nWhen I met my exhusband, he was sweet and kind and attentive. After we'd been together for a while, he had an 'episode' where he slammed me against a car and shook me. He thought I'd been cheating. I quit seeing him for a couple of months, but he kept calling and I agreed to come back if he got counseling.\n\nHe pretended to go to counseling and things settled down. There were a few minor things that happened along the way, which of course I regret giving him the benefit of the doubt on. We got married, and that was when the nightmare began.\n\nI was no longer a girlfriend he wanted to keep, I was suddenly \"HIS WIFE\" and thus his property. Two weeks after we were married, he had an episode of extreme violence. I still didn't learn my lesson, and after four months apart and him going to court-ordered anger management, I stupidly went back. We had been dating, he had been kind, attentive, and \"himself\" once more for months.\n\nWhen I went back, he escalated immediately. He created several scenes at my work and got me fired. He wrecked my car. He told all of the neighbors that I had early-onset dementia and if they ever saw me leave, they should call him. He would literally come get me and drag me screaming for help into his van. The neighbors would WATCH, shaking their heads in pity. That poor man and his crazy wife... He had shown them (fake) doctor's notes about it. They believed him, never once called the cops.\n\nEventually, I found out about a local battered women's shelter. I hid in the bathroom and called on an old, inactive cellphone. When he heard the police coming, he quickly rearranged the house. He had ripped one of the blinds down. He put it back. He quickly put the lamp he threw back on the end table. He smirked, looked me in the face and said, \"You know what I learned from the other guys at anger management? If you clean up and nothing looks out of place, the police won't believe your bitch wife. You're never getting out of here.\"\n\nI did eventually talk those officers into taking me to the battered women's shelter, but it was incredibly difficult. I demanded to be taken to a hospital if they believed his lies about dementia.\n\nI shouldn't have had to fight police to get to a battered women's shelter. The cops kept telling me, \"They won't take you. You're not battered. You're fine. Why would they take you? HE NEVER HIT YOU.\"\n\nYou know what his statement was? He lit my clothes on fire while I was wearing them. He held me down with his hand over my nose and mouth. He slammed me against the wall so hard I had bruises all the lengths of my back and hips. BUT.... \"I never hit you even once.\"\n\nThe thing is, people kept telling me, \"Why didn't you just leave?\" Even the cops said, \"If it's that bad, just leave.\"\n\nI TRIED to leave. I wish people would understand that it's not as simple as \"just leave\" and that no, the police do NOT always automatically believe the woman. Not at all. Getting an order of protection against him was a whole other nightmare, and it shouldn't have been.\n\nI'm tired of hearing \"cops always believe the woman\" as if it's universal and immutable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you so, so, so much. I really just needed to talk about this yesterday, in a safe way. I'm so grateful right now for the sub and for the people who were so kind and understanding. I can't tell you how much I needed it yesterday and last night. It's been over a decade since I escaped, and I'm safe now and he moved on long ago. I don't know what it was yesterday that brought it on outside of seeing yet another \"cops always believe the woman\" post that was the straw on the camel's back, I guess.\n\nWhatever it was, I did not expect such a kind and overwhelming response. Thank you. I'm so sorry to those who have also been through this. I shouldn't be surprised that there are so MANY of us.\n\nIf you're in an abusive situation right now, you're not alone. You're not the only one. You matter. You can escape, you're stronger than you can even imagine right now. Don't be afraid to start over if that's what needs to happen. You can. You will. You ARE strong enough. S/He won't change. Ever.\n\nYou ARE lovable and s/he's NOT the only one who can ever love you. S/He's terrified you'll realize that. There are billions of wo/men on this planet and there are load of wonderful ones. You don't need them.\n\nAnyone of any gender who's reading this. You are lovable. You don't need that abuser in your life. She or he or they won't change if they haven't yet. Go. You're stronger than you can ever imagine. Be free. It will be rough but you have what it takes. You don't have to feel that you have it, just take the first terrifying steps. Those really are the hardest.",

I have been doing some doctor shopping for a new medication provider after my old one, who I adored, left the practice.\n\n\nI saw a woman who seemed nice at first. Then she started asking if I'm planning on getting pregnant, etc. I replied absolutely not and that I have an IUD and am not interested in ever getting pregnant. I guess I sounded immediately defensive so she started going \"well we have to ask all women of child bearing age\", which I guess but I've definitely never been asked before.\n\n\nThen she started going on about how harmful the stimulants I'm on can be to in utero babies and how we should consider going off of them just in case. I kind of lost it on her, on top of a lot of other ridiculous things she said. She said she would renew the prescription this time but we'd need to discuss it in the future.\n\n\n\nI was so mad I just cried afterwards. I need these medications to function. They make life manageable for me, and I have absolutely no interest in ever being pregnant. I would immediately get an abortion before even considering having a baby. But she cared more about the health of a baby that's never going to exist than she did about me. It made me feel absolutely worthless and I'm so scared of trying to find another doctor because I desperately need this medication and I just emotionally cannot handle continuing having to fight for it just because I have a uterus.",

Not the best combo.\n\nI'm fully vaccinated (with a booster thanks to the immunosuppressive meds I'm on) and attended a work function on Friday. It was required that every employee be fully vaccinated to attend. I was a bit concerned, but it was the first real thing I've done like that since February of 2020.

My husband is immunocompromised. I'm terrified that one of us will get a serious breakthrough infection. I lost my godson to Covid last year and it's close to home, and scary.\n\nSo I went to get tested. My husband did as well, just to be safe. He was in and out in 5 minutes. I waited an additional 30 minutes to be called in, and then 45 more for the actual test.

Basically when you’re stitched up after giving birth some doctors can (without consent by you) provide a few extra stitches to make your vagina tighter for strictly your husbands pleasure.\n\nChildbirth is awful enough, but when the husband stitch is done, the aftermath can be just...god. My stomach rolled at the thought. As a woman this to me is just gross. This women literally just got done pushing a baby out and you’re worried it’s gonna be loose when you hit it again. Ugh. The fact that it’s not even an uncommon practice is APPALLING!!\n\nAlso it doesn't even work, it usually just makes sex painful, so the opposite of making the woman want to return to having sex.\n\nOne of the most fucked up examples of the patriarchy in action.

    "text": "TIL It’s legal and common practice in areas for medical students and residents to perform unnecessary pelvic exams on women under anesthesia. I came across a TikTok today that explained how there are many states in the US that don’t require explicit consent from patients for medical students or residents to perform unnecessary pelvic exams on women who are unconscious. These are done purely for the benefit of the medical student to learn how to perform pelvic exams and are used during completely unrelated procedures. Apparently, as long as you consent to medical students participating in your care, it is considered “implied consent”. \n\nBeing a Canadian, I decided to look it up in my country. This was standard practice prior to 2006 when it was banned. In 2010, they changed the ruling slightly which actually still allows residents to perform these procedures now without explicit consent... all in the name of “learning”.\n\nMany doctors spoke up against the ban wondering how it would be possible for medical students to learn without doing it secretly. Women are being treated like cadavers or practice dummies and many are none the wiser. I even read one story in which a woman was informed by a medical student that she had started her period when she had abdominal surgery. She asked how he would know that and that’s when she was told he had performed this procedure completely irrelevant to her surgery. \n\nPlease check with your state or government to see if there is such a law to protect you. If not, then be sure to explicitly tell your medical professionals you do not consent to an pelvic exams or unnecessary procedures while under anesthesia.",

    "text": "Male ER doctor completely dismissed my concerns and I had to push for testing for a potentially dangerous issue. WTF. TMI warning. I woke up at 3am on Tuesday morning, vomiting and shitting all over myself. No trigger for it, seemingly no reason, absolutely zero control over the situation. I stayed home that day and the vomiting and shitting continued throughout the day. I took meds to attempt to control it but by evening I was running a 102 degree fever and both initial symptoms were still going. By bedtime that night the vomiting had stopped so I took some Imodium and slept on the bathroom floor just in case. Wednesday I felt very nauseous and had to force myself to eat but thankfully the Imodium had worked. Thursday I noticed my stool was black. When I got home I used the toilet and the toilet was full of bright red blood and when I wiped, literal blood clots were on the toilet paper along with a lot of bright red blood. I wiped at my front a few times to make sure the blood wasn’t coming from there. I explained the situation to my husband, and as the son of a RN, he told me to get in the car and we went to the ER. I looked online to see when rectal bleeding is something to worry about and it said if it’s heavy, continuous, or accompanied by pain or fever or vomiting. \n\nSo we get to the ER and I showed the doctor a picture of the blood and the clots, and he immediately says, “that’s completely normal for women with pcos, this is not an emergency issue.” I explained it did not come from my vagina, it came out of my anus. He asked if I was sure. 🙄🤦‍♀️\n\nI insisted he do some testing, I said he can do a pelvic exam if he wants confirmation that I’m not on my period. He finally agreed to do a fecal smear test and some blood work, and I gave a urine sample. He told me to get dressed because “once the tests come back normal, I’m dismissing you.”\n\nGuess what. He came back a while later and said they were going to put in an iv and do a ct scan, because the tests showed blood in the fecal smear. No shit Sherlock. Long story short I now have to go to a gastroenterologist and get further testing done. But it just pissed me off so bad that this doctor completely dismissed my concerns and if I hadn’t pushed, I would never have gotten the referral I needed to get my body checked out. \n\nJust because it’s blood coming from the pelvic area of a woman does not automatically mean it’s menstrual blood! WTF. \n\nI am so sorry for the details but I don’t have anyone else to talk to that would understand.\n\nEdit: my test results were uploaded to the online chart thing today. I didn’t understand a lot of the medical jargon but the things I saw that stood out was that my fecal smear tested positive for blood, my urinalysis tested positive for blood and protein, some kind of bacteria was present in my urine, and my white and red blood cell counts were both out of normal ranges and flagged for further review. My ct scan detected fluid in my colon that could be blood. Oh, and I am definitely not pregnant.",

    "text": "Sometimes I feel like women's pain isn't taken seriously I've dealt with chronic and occasionally debilitating pain since I was 16. I'm in my 20s now and have only started advocating for myself but it's been hard.\n\nIt started when I was 16 with pain and stiffness in my knees, being both a dancer and an athlete I took this quite seriously and sought out medical advice. They told me it was probably just an overuse issue and to make sure I warmed up properly\n\nWhen I was 17 it spread to my hips and shoulders, I was referred to a pediatric rheumatologist who didn't run any tests or even examine me. They wouldn't even look me in the eyes when talking to me and spoke past me to my father who kept saying to talk to me since it's my problem and he's bad at English. The pediatric rheumatologist just told ***him*** it was because I was flexible and that I should quit dance and my other sports to make it better.\n\nA few months later I turned 18 and aged out of the care of the pediatric rheumatologist and had to go back to seeing a GP, my regular one had gone on leave and his replacement told me that \"it's probably just hormonal since your periods are short\" and sent me on my way\n\nAfter another year when I was 19, I finally got a referral to another rheumatologist. The receptionist told me that \"we don't normally treat teenagers\" and kept trying to book me for appointments at times I wasn't available. When I was finally able to make it in for an appointment the Dr. told me to just take Advil until it stops working and to come back in 6 months for a follow-up.\n\nThree weeks later a get a call from the rheumatologist's receptionist angrily asking me why I hadn't shown up for my appointment *(Which I hadn't booked)*. She told me that she had called and left several messages reminding me of the appointment. She said that I \"probably don't have any real issues if I can't even show up to appointments.\" When I asked which phone number she had been calling she responded with my father's number (who was listed as my emergency contact). I told her that was not the contact number in my file and was hung up on.\n\nWhen I tried to book my follow-up at the 6-month mark I was told since \"I had missed previous appointments\" they would no longer seeing me.\n\nAt this point, the pain has spread throughout my spine and is starting to affect my ability to use my hands *(and as a sign language user this was really distressing)*\n\nLater that year I moved for university and tried to get help through my University's health clinic. I wasn't even allowed to book an appointment because \"other students have real problems.\"\n\n\"Real problems\"\n\nThis was real to me. This was affecting my ability to communicate, complete my school work, take care of myself, I was losing sleep, I was losing weight, It was affecting my ability to live \n\n**I was spiralling**\n\n*But my problems weren't real*\n\nThen the pandemic started and suddenly doctors weren't taking non-emergent appointments anymore.\n\nSo I kept trudging along, working, studying, and getting worse.\n\nWhen things started to open up again I tried to book an appointment with my GP but since my issue is chronic it was seen as \"non-urgent\" and I was told the soonest appointment was over a month out. I booked it and waited\n\nAnd I waited,\n\nAs things got worse\n\nAs I deteriorated\n\nMy fingers curled in on themselves\n\nI had to type with my hands turned the other way using my knuckles.\n\nI called my clinic again telling them that things were getting worse, and what I got in response was that my appointment was in just a few weeks.\n\nMy co-workers called the clinic in a rage\n\nAnd suddenly an appointment magically appeared.\n\nA few days ago I go into my appointment and the Doc asks me how I've been, and my facade breaks.  I can't speak, I can only cry. He picks up his phone and tells the receptionist to call his other patients and tell them that's he'll be running behind schedule for the rest of the day and to give them a heads up.\n\nMy appointment was only supposed to take 15 minutes but I was there for over an hour.\n\nI'm almost 21 now but for the first time since I was 16 a doctor listened to me, he noted my symptoms, he asked me questions, I got a physical examination for the first time, he ordered tests,\n\nand for the first time ever my pain was taken seriously and not just dismissed with a hand wave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis story doesn't end with a diagnosis, a cure, and a happy ending because It's still very much ongoing. But it shouldn't have taken nearly five years of me living in pain to have a doctor take me seriously.\n\nI've heard similar stories from my friends and here on this sub that all have the same disheartening takeaway\n\n**Sometimes if you are a woman trying to seek medical care you have to aggressively advocate for yourself in order to be taken seriously and have your problems addressed.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Fixed some grammar stuff and a typo",

    "text": "Goodbye I remember taking handover from a colleague a few years ago as I was starting the night shift. The patient was an elderly man in one of our resuscitation rooms. He’d choked on a piece of bread while sat with his family for dinner, and had a hypoxic cardiac arrest following this. It took some time for paramedics to arrive and get ROSC, but he then had a number of further cardiac arrests en route to the emergency department, where he then had one more. He was maxed out on epinephrine and norepinephrine and still had a blood pressure of 50/20. GCS was a flat 3 on zero sedation, and his oxygenation was also terrible despite being intubated. He was accepted to geriatrics for palliation but ICU did not want to accept him as there was no expectation at all of a meaningful recovery and they wanted to save the bed for someone who'd benefit from the resources ICU provides. So this was the last patient in my handover and the first task of my night.\n\nThis particular department is a tertiary center that receives trauma. With all of our resuscitation rooms full, we had nowhere to accept the next trauma patient to and nowhere to see the next septic patient to come through the doors. I spent the first few hours of my shift having multiple conversations with the family about their relative's clinical state and tried to explain that the blood pressure was being supported by medication but still too low to allow for adequate oxygenation, urine output, or any chance of neurological recovery. They were aware that our plan was to allow a natural death and that the ventilator and the vasopressors were only prolonging this, but they were desperate to keep everything going as it was for as long as possible. My goal was to try to get them to understand that supporting his physiology was futile and that allowing him to die would be more dignified.\n\nDuring one of these conversations away from the bedside, we were alerted to the fact that his end-tidal CO2 had dropped off. There was no respiratory effort and his blood pressure had become unrecordable. At this point, I said quite firmly that I was turning the ventilator off as it was no longer doing the job that we were using it for.\n\nFast forward a few years. Three months ago, my mother suffered a sizeable stroke that was amenable to clot retrieval, but this was followed by a large subarachnoid hemorrhage and then another shower of clots. She was comatose for a few days and, when I arrived to her bedside (having to fly from the other side of the world, which in itself was a challenge) she was tolerating a nasopharyngeal airway and barely opening her eyes. She got better from this and over the next couple of weeks was breathing fine again. She was looking around, able to move her head and able to move her left upper limb around. She was reaching out for me and stroking my face. She was able to scratch her itches when she needed to and was playing around with the bedside phone. She held my hand when I sat with her.\n\nNow let's recap the last 30 years. My mother had many health issues over the course of her life, and had breast cancer shortly after I was born. She didn't deal well with being a single mother undergoing breast cancer treatment and so I spent a lot of time with my aunts. She didn't deal very well with being a single mother after her breast cancer treatment either, and the home situation was often very tense. We grew up dirt poor and on welfare. Social services ended up getting involved when I was 6 and I was on their child protection register. She said bad things to the family that alienated me, was often absent emotionally and sometimes physically, and eventually kicked me out when I turned 16, a few years after I stopped going to school. I haven't really talked to her properly over the second half of my life and haven't spoken to her at all in the last three, but I thought about her every day and always wished that things were better.\n\nNow back to present day. Despite reaching this level of consciousness, she is now bedbound and unable to communicate, and this is a woman who previously valued her independence so much that she didn't want to accept any help from her own son despite being burdened with a number of chronic illnesses that limited her mobility and caused her significant pain on a daily basis. Her house is a mess and I had made many offers to help her clean, de-clutter, buy new furniture and a fresh coat of paint. But she always said no, and being asked always angered her.\n\nReading through her diaries, I can see now that she's been miserable for the longest time, even before I was born, feeling like a failure in life because she was so restricted by her health conditions. And yet, knowing this, I still wanted to do everything possible to keep her alive for as long as possible - even though I knew that this wasn't a life she would have ever wanted for herself. Her admission has been horrible, complicated by blood clots in the upper limbs that have caused ischemic changes of the hands and forearms. I've advocated on every occasion for antibiotics, anti-coagulation, consults with surgeons and interventional radiologists, and central venous access to allow these interventions to continue, and I have pushed to continue even when we thought she was close to certain death on fie or six occasions. There was never an expectation, particularly with the extent of brain injury, that she would have a life that was anything like the life she had before, but if she was in a care facility somewhere then I could visit every few months and she'd still be alive. That was enough for me - but not really fair for her.\n\nI received a call over the weekend saying that I needed to come in. She'd had multiple episodes of hematochezia which precludes the use of any further anti-coagulation, and a subsequent NSTEMI. Her renal function has suffered and I've not seen her move any of her limbs in the last week; she's probably had another stroke with the anemia. I've not left the ward since then.\n\nI've seen the progression from comatose to awake-ish and still tracking objects to crying in pain from the blistering on her hands (the first time I really felt she was back in the room - and the first time I was hopeful she might leave hospital) to now Cheyne-Stoke breathing over the last day and a half. I've cried on her arm so much over the last few days because I regret not having a better relationship with her and I wish so much that I'd given her an opportunity to get to know her son a bit better.\n\nOn Saturday, I wanted her to receive a blood transfusion after her three episodes of hematochezia.\n\nOn Sunday, I wanted her to have a second set of blood tests to see if she'd had a type 2 MI.\n\nOn Monday, the team quite frankly said that the only option now was palliation. But she still had her eyes open and was still looking around, and it still felt wrong. They tried to have a conversation with me about the fact that her kidneys aren't being properly perfused and that she's not expected to make a meaningful neurological recovery, but I still wanted another set of blood tests.\n\nOn Tuesday, I sat and talked. I told her about all the holidays I wanted to take her on, and that I wanted to fly her to Sydney to see where I've set up home. I told her about all the fridge magnets I'd bought for her on my travels, that I'd been saving up to bring home to her one day. I told her about all the birthday and Christmas presents I'd bought for her but never had an opportunity to give her. I told her that I love her and that I'm proud of her for powering on every single day of her life in spite of obvious pain and disability, and in spite of her less obvious internal struggles.\n\nOn Wednesday, I finally allowed the first dose of morphine to be given. I was so scared to commit to it because that first dose means that we're committed to this. But the nasogastric feeds continue because I don't want her to become dehydrated, and she's still receiving some of her regular medications because I don't want her last few days to be worsened by a flare of her auto-immune conditions.\n\nI'm a doctor. I know better than anyone else in my family what her prognosis has been. I know that this isn't a quality of life that she would have wanted for herself and I've been secretly wishing for the last few months that something would take her away and that it would be swift - because then the decision is taken out of my hands and I don't have to be the one to start her on that final path. But every time she became febrile or tachycardic, I pushed for fluids and antibiotics because I wasn't ready to say goodbye. And I thought back to the family I'd had these same conversations with a few years ago while sat with my mother today. And it all suddenly made sense. His wife was a doctor but she wanted the ventilator, the pressors, the monitoring, the central line, and the ICU admission. She wasn't ready to say goodbye, even when faced with clear evidence that he was never coming back to her.\n\nNo matter how logical it may seem to you as the healthcare provider and no matter how logical it may seem to me as the relative with a medical degree, saying goodbye is still painfully impossible to do. I've accepted now that she may die today or tomorrow, but I still haven't agreed to withdrawing all treatments because I can't. I wish I could tell that family that I get it now and apologise for only seeing their situation through the eyes of the clinician. Next time I have that conversation with someone, I'll be more patient. I'll be more understanding. I'll walk away if they say no and I'll let them have as much time as they need. I've always known how my mother will go but I've needed three months and it's taken significant complications, a lot of time, and hard evidence in the form of lab results to finally start being able to accept that I need to let her go.\n\nBe kind.",

    "text": "How to cope with bad cases Hey everyone, I'm a medical student needing some input on how to deal with a really bad case I saw at my rotation recently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor context, I'm about to finish med school and I've been in clinical rotations for the last two years so I already have some experience in the hospital. I've also had really serious cases before: I've seen patients die, I've been there when people were told they have cancer, I've watched patients being resuscitated after suicide attempts, I've worked with babies in palliative care. Of course all of those situations were not easy, but usually I'm able to cope with my feelings enough so they don't impact my whole life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, now I've met this patient that really got to me. It was a woman with horrible Fournier Gangrene. She has lots of preexisting conditions and had been in the hospital regularly, she had noticed this pain and small swelling in her perineal area a few weeks ago and told her doctors but they weren't concerned. I guess then it escalated pretty quickly. She showed up in the ER because the pain had been getting worse, that's where I met her. She was in a horrible condition, septic, and the \"small swelling\" had gotten huge and starting to get necrotic. While we worked on her, preparing her for surgery and stabilizing her, she cried the whole time. Told me multiple times that she had been telling her doctors so often that something was wrong but nobody had done anything. Screamed in pain. Cried because she was so embarassed of the smell. It was so fucking sad. \n\nThat surgery was the worst thing I've ever seen, she's in the ICU and will probably not survive this. But that's not even what makes it so hard for me, it's how much she suffered when I saw her in the ER. I can almost still hear her crying in my head. I wonder all the time if this could have been prevented if someone had reacted earlier. I keep imagining that horrible situation and I wish I could just make her pain stop, hold her and tell her everything's going to be ok and to not worry about that smell (I actually did tell her that, but I think I just wasn't able to make her feel better). In reality I couldn't help her at all, I was so damn useless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs there anything I can do to cope with such experiences better? I can't get it out of my head, and it's making me seriously question my ability to be a doctor. How will I be able to be there for my patients when only one bad case makes me feel so depressed I just wanna cry everytime I think about it? Please tell me I can learn this!",

    "text": "The AMS Consult *No spoilers, but this felt relevant, given today's other posts. Names, details, etc. changed for privacy and because I'm not a total jerk.*\n\n*Apologies, this got a bit long. Please still read it.*\n\n-------\n\nWhen I LARP as a neurohospitalist, things tend to come in waves. Not precisely the same things, mind you. The fine details are endlessly, fractally variable - but the broader brush strokes, much less so. If I see two cardioembolic stroke patients in a day, I can be sure that another five are waiting or actively infarcting in the emergency room. I diagnosed three new cases glioblastoma multiforme (1) in three days. Strangely enough, they all came in between 12-2pm on consecutive days, as if by USPS. A year ago, I diagnosed three new cases of HSV encephalitis in much the same fashion; in proper public health fashion, I confirmed that they all lived distantly from one another, and shared no friends, prostitutes, or toilet seats. \n\n\nNo week is more challenging, however, than the week in which you receive a pallet-full of altered mental status consults. I should take a moment here to point out that that this isn't the kind of challenging you went into medicine for - there's no wiping sweat off your brow, pouring fluids into beakers, or examining blood samples under microscopes till the early morning. You never get to stare up through the ceiling and directly into the eyes of the Almighty, announce that it isn’t this old bitch's time yet, and then - remaining sterile, of course - jam a needle into their living heart with both hands. \n\n\nRather, it's challenging because, in most cases, the obvious things have been done and there isn't much left to offer. There's very rarely an exciting or sexy diagnostic consideration left on the table (2). It only remains to be accepted that, after a certain amount of labs and imaging, obtunded patients will stay obtunded and worried families will stay worried. The patients that generally merit the dreaded “AMS” neuro consult are ill, and often have been for quite some time. Quite a few of these patients have also been alive long to have had lots of other conditions crop up and become chronic - so their medical burden is typically high, even prior to this most recent admission for pooping out a kidney or what have you. To add insult to injury, their labs have only recently become non-catastrophic. \n\n\nNot to be glib, but it's pretty rare that an MRI ordered by neurology will lead to the patient sitting up and starting a nuanced discussion of the Fed's interest rate policy - even if we do it with contrast. \n\n\nIn placing this consult, typically one of two tacit questions are posed to the neurologist:  \"well, the  kidney that's still inside them works, so what the hell?\" or \"We told the patient's family you'd make their brain work again.\"\n\n\nUnfortunately, I never did learn how to make a brain perk up and just start doing better. I try to relay this as kindly and early as I can. I think most of the doctors or families that request my consultation are left with the question \"Well, then what's the point of you?\" It's a good question.\n\n\nI find that the most useful thing I can do is to first make sure that nobody is trying to do a lumbar puncture without any idea of what they're looking for (3), and then take an accurate history. Almost as a rule, somebody else has already taken a stab at it, and reports to me that this frail creature who likely predates the cotton gin is \"usually really sharp.\" This almost always turns out to be the optimistic view of a family whose love allows them to look past things like: falling for repeated Nigerian prince scams; occasionally drifting across the double yellow line, or through a Costco while driving; trouble staying awake for more than 6 hours a day, ever since they saw an interacial couple on television and had their first heart attack.\n\n\nI'm being cynical, of course, and unfair in a few different directions. Not all consults are like that. Not all of these patients are elderly, or chronically confused, or easily explained away by the acute issues that brought them to the hospital in the first place. That's probably the worst part of the altered mental status consult - the knowledge that as soon as you get too jaded or dismissive, the hospital will give you something weird or complex to screw up.\n\n\nWhen the consult popped up on my phone, I could feel my blood pressure spike, just a little. For some reason, pages sent by nurses in our system always appear in caps, which grants a sense of urgency that is often unfair (4). As I read through the chart, things didn't get much better. Sure, the patient was in his 50's, but he was ill! He'd been admitted for covid a few weeks ago, and it didn't appear that a single end organ had escaped unscathed. Lots of his lab values had little red flags next to them, and I was already developing the bitter smugness that makes everyone cherish specialists so much. To top it all off, the notes made mention that the patient's *wife* was the one that thought he was confused! Did the hospitalist themselves even have a question for me?\n\n\nI've been surprised in the past, and so of course I went to see the patient - but don't imagine that I didn't do it without a lot of grumbling and quiet drama. I may have leaned my head back against a wall and sighed a few times. If there had been a rock or empty can in the hallway, I'd have given it a doleful kick (5). I donned my PPE with the pique of a high schooler that shows up for detention, but, like, doesn't even *care* about it because it's just so *arbitrary*. \n\n\nWhen I entered the room, I encountered a man of about middle age, with receding hair that flourished into a mullet, steely blue eyes, and a beard that plunged gracefully down his neck and into his chest hair without the faintest hesitation. He had huge, undefined arms, and the kind of belly that doesn't protrude necessarily, but bulges anyway due to omental abundance and organ huskiness. If we were in a drinking contest, he seemed to be the type that could lift a keg over his head and finish it with a laugh before I was halfway into my first rosé.\n\n\n\"Help you?\" he asked me with a lift of his eyebrows. I don't run into this greeting much in the hospital, and it charms me every time. The scrubs & coat costume I throw on usually signifies that I'm the one providing help, or at least pantomiming it while doing reflexes. So when patients offer, even as a figure of speech, it just feels nice.\n\n\nI introduced myself, gave my usual wave, etc. I asked him some incisive questions about his location, the date, why he was in the hospital. He replied - respectively - with:\n\n\n1) \"A shitbox hospital with half decent food.\"\n\n2) \"You're the fourth guy to ask me that today. It's _______. Feel like I oughta be testing you people.\"\n\n3) \"Fuckin' covid.\"\n\n\nThis wasn't how they speak to one another at Buckingham Palace, but he was hardly wrong. To tell the truth, I was having trouble actually detecting any confusion. I decided to earn my paycheck and ask about some semantics.\n\n\n\"If you would, explain this phrase to me: 'The grass is always greener on the other side.' \"\n\n\nI looked at him expectantly, and he returned the favor for a long moment, before finally asking \"The grass?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, as in a lawn or something.\"\n\n\n\"Kid, I don't give a shit about grass.\"\n\n\n\"Well, sure.\" I said. \"But I'm more trying to see if you can explain the idea.\"\n\n\n\"Well, I'm not a goddamn gardener. How about that idea?\"\n\n\n\"No, no, I get it. You're not growing heirloom tomatoes,\" I agreed. I was holding my hands up, as if in surrender, but I continued to press him, as some deep part of me had apparently decided that this was the hill I would die on. \"But maybe there's something in that yard that you do like.\"\n\n\n\"Like a woman?\" he asked.\n\n\n\"A what?\" Masks can cover many things, and are one of our best chances at curbing the spread of covid19 - but they do nothing for the squeak of a neurologist's voice as they completely lose control of the interview. \n\n\nHe repeated himself, and I stared for a long while, picking my way through an ethical minefield before finally settling on a lame \"Sure, I guess.\"\n\n\nAt this, he fixed me with a piercing look, cocking his head a little as he read deeply - and incorrectly - into my history and character. Then, in a much gentler tone: \"Kid, let me tell you something my daddy told me, ok? Dance with the girl you brung. It's that simple. Don't go looking around.\"\n\n\n\"No, no, not me,\" I prostest. \"I said *grass*, you’re the one that -“ but he cut me off.\n\n\n\"Don't get divorced, kid. You'll regret it if you do,\" he said, with the compassion of a man that had made mistakes, lived through them, and cared enough to pass those lessons along.\n\n\n\"...I won't,\" I promised, in the voice of a hesitant, scrawnier man who hadn't planned to make any mistakes in the first place. At this point, it was clear I had to change things up a little. Mentally setting my jaw and yanking my scrubs up to my nipples, I decided to be direct. \"Look, do you feel like yourself? Or have you been feeling a bit foggy?\"\n\n\n\"Foggy *how*?\" he asked, suspiciously.\n\n\n\"You see, they called me because there was some concern that you were confused,\" I told him. “But you don't seem terribly confused to me, so I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing in here, and how I can be helpful.\"\n\n\nWith that, his eyes narrowed. With a sort of icy calm, he asked me who exactly had said he was confused. I told him that the hospitalist had been “a little concerned,” and there was some mention that his wife “had been concerned as well.” This was, in fact, the most cowardly way I could have put things, and I didn’t do so by accident. Alarm bells were ringing in my head, and if I’d thought speaking in a Little Annie voice would have helped, I’d have done it in a second. Pride goeth and all that.\n\n\nAs it turned out, my fight or flight response had been dead on. When I mentioned his wife, I could feel the temperature in the room drop by at least 10 degrees. He flushed a deep red. The cords on his forearms stood out, and for a moment, it seemed as though the lights dimmed a little. Though he’d hardly moved a muscle, the inappropriate tenderness of a few moments ago was gone. Suddenly, he was fraught with power; a Talladegan Hephaestus who might lay me across his anvil in a rage if I didn’t watch what I said next. Underneath the hum of the jury-rigged HVAC, I swore I could hear the rumble of plates shifting beneath our feet, and the shriek of ball lightning.\n\n\n“*I see*,” he finally said, and his tone was measured. Since I wasn’t entirely sure of what it was he did see, I kept my mouth shut - but I was certain it wasn’t the sort of thing I’d be able to lay to bed with an MRI and some gabapentin.\n\n\n“This again,” he continued, his face beginning to twist with rage. “This shit just *does not end*.” He paused between these last words, giving each their own emphasis, before meeting my gaze with a look that both threatened and begged understanding. “Look, not going to college don't make a man confused.\"\n\n\n“No, obviously not. I mean, Justin Bieber right?”\n\n\n*Immediately*, a wave of regret washed over me. In both my head and my heart, I’d truly meant to say “Bill Gates.” But there appears to be some mechanism, some sort of infernal collapsible circuit just south of Broca’s region, which was built solely with the purpose of making me look like a shit head (6).\n\n\nSensibly enough, he ignored me. “Having a few hobbies don't fuckin' make him confused either.\" His voice was getting louder now. “But any time I don't do something her way don't make me confused!\"\n\n\nIf you’d diagrammed this last sentence, it would have looked like a spiral - but I took it in the spirit in which it was shouted. Cooler heads needed to prevail. \n\n\"I understand that, sir, but I think we need to calm down a little,\" I said. It was probably close to the right thing to say - but consider that I was also wearing foggy goggles, purple latex gloves, and a big blue trash bag that I'd cinched around my hips and shoulders. To my own dull horror, I further realized that, at some point,  I had hunched my shoulders and laced my fingers across my belly (7). Whatever was happening here had years of marital discord behind it. That kind of momentum simply does not get derailed by fancy little gentlemen in DIY Veruca Salt drag.\n\n\n“I know what this is about!” These last words appeared to tear something deep inside of him on their way out; his face wore the faraway tragic expression of a veteran that cannot forget. Then, in a desperate half-whisper: “I left the dog in Charlotte on purpose!”\n\n\n\"Oh, shit,\" said someone that sounded an awful lot like me.\n\n\n“We was in Charlotte in June and we took the goddamn dog with us. Well, when we got ready to come back, I told the dog get in the truck. It never listened, and I just decided, you know, fuck it. That dog never liked me. So I figured I’d just kinda… see what happened.”\n\n\nI stared at him.\n\n\n“So, like, we start driving. Truck’s pretty full, but she didn’t even notice he weren’t there. So I keep driving. I guess after a while it was kind of quiet and suddenly Carol just screams out ‘*Brantley*!’ Nearly drove off the fuckin' road.”\n\n\nI almost staggered at this latest revelation. They’d named the dog “Brantley.” Even dog murder paled in comparison.\n\n\n“She couldn’t believe we’d forgotten him. I mean, *I* could,” he said with a sort of shrug. “But I just kind of played along, you know? Acted surprised and all. I told her it was too far to turn around anyway - it was, like, two hours.” He paused for a second, as if realizing something for the first time. “Two whole hours,” he repeated, more indignantly. “And she says I’m confused?” \n\n\n“Look, I have to stop you here, sir. I’m not sure I can be helpful with a lot of this. I know I can’t, in fact,” I started, trying to build up an exit strategy. But he’d obviously stumbled onto a new line of reasoning here, and he was going to explore it to the fullest.\n\n\n“Maybe she’s the one that’s confused,” he suggested. “Maybe you oughta be having this conversation with *her*.”\n\n\n“No, I should not,” I said, essentially out of tricks.\n\n\nBut, in keeping with our entire conversation to day, he simply ignored me and reached for his phone. I placed my hand over his without thinking and his eyes snapped up to mine. I suddenly felt like a zookeeper that’s forgotten to give the resident hippo a warning pat before it’s nightly suppository. But I held my ground this time, reasoning that no matter the outcome - abrupt violence or continuing this interview with his wife added to the mix - I was going to die in this room. The only way out was through.\n\n\n“Just let me examine you, ok? If everything looks ok, then I’ll leave you alone. If not, then we’ll figure it out together. Just bear with me.”\n\n\nAfter a few moments of reflection, he decided to leave my skeleton inside of my skin, and we got started. It was almost a relief to start getting some objective data, after the swamp of emotional volatility we’d just waded through together. I was certain that after a few cranial nerves, pushes, pulls and taps to muscle bellies, our relationship would reach its natural conclusion. \n\n\nCertainty is generally idiotic, especially when you’re me, and double especially when you’re in the hospital. I showed very little promise as a neuro-ophthalmologist during residency, and so when I watched his eye movements, the words that popped into my head were “janky AF eye twerking;\" the more sober and literate among us would describe these findings as “gaze evoked multidirectional nystagmus, oculomotor apraxia, and likely saccadic intrusions.”\n\n\nHis motor exam revealed similar spontaneous oddities and incoordination. On activation - i.e. when he wasn’t lying still or clutching bed sheets in a sort of righteous fury - his movements were decidedly weird. I either hadn’t noticed before, or I’d written it off as agitation and fidgetiness. But it was in fact a tendency towards choreoathetosis which he was able to transiently suppress. \n\n\nTo get to the punchline, I’ll simply tell you that his sensory exam was fine, and his reflexes were pathologic. His MRI showed malevolent-looking, diffuse T2 FLAIR changes throughout most of the cerebral subcortical regions - including all of the gray matter you don't want to see involved. There were patches of roughly correlating DWI changes, tiny GRE blooms throughout with a particular affinity for the bilateral caudate heads, and no enhancing lesions. \n\n\nHis wife was a story unto herself, and it was a phone interview for the ages. There was a lot of material to get through regarding their marriage, their kids, her mother's loveless marriage, etc. But honestly, at this point, I simply had to know. I would have interviewed Brantley if I’d had to.\n\n\nFeelings and matrimonial history aside, I learned that he worked in a machine shop. I also learned that he did in fact have some hobbies, which included amateur metallurgy and electroplating. He’d started recently, and enjoyed it very much. “Amateur,” in this context meant that he’d assembled a shed behind his house, where he kept: plastic tubs full of chemicals; some car batteries; ladles; a leather apron; some old gold jewelry, in a gunsafe he’d welded to a bunch of weights. Things he had not invested in included: face or eye protection; lids for the tubs; a fan of some kind. \n\n\nI asked about some of the chemicals he used. At various times they'd included nickel, silver, gold, and cyanide. I did confirm this last one. \n\n\n*Mystery solved*, I thought. That’s it. Toxicity from exposure to aerosolized cyanide and God knows what else, yielding neuropsychiatric changes including (but not limited to) atypical eye movements, choreoathetosis, and irrational hatred of what I imagined to be a golden doodle. It made sense. It felt right. There was still plenty of work to be done, and I doubted I could entirely defer a lumbar puncture in good conscience - but it seemed as though I'd finally be able to put a bow on this particular psychodrama, and move on with my life. I started to wonder if this wasn't what Free Willy had felt like, as he leapt over the rock wall, into the sunset, and just over the head of a poorly supervised orphan. \n\n\nAs I started to relax, she dropped the final bomb on me. “Of course, he lost our *first* dog about a year ago.”\n\n\nBelieve it or not, he did have CJD. He had been acting oddly for some time now, and the bizarre, poorly considered metallurgy set up in the back yard was almost certainly more symptom than cause. I followed him, and watched his decline. His initial EEG didn't show me much, but the follow up study in 3 months showed me those classed periodic sharp wave complexes - it was the first time I'd seen them in the wild, and not my attending's file of interesting EEG snippets. I think I only fully relaxed, though, when the 14-3-3 protein came back positive. I spoke to his wife a lot during this period; I don't know how much she liked me, but since she'd only ever known me during the worst time of her life, and I couldn't blame her. \n\n\nAMS consults, as a rule, are an utter goddamn pain. There's no getting around it. And then, maybe 1% of the time, they're the single wildest ride you can take - and they're precisely what you signed on for.\n\n\n--------------\n\n1) A disease whose sole risk factor, based on my own anecdata, appears to be the possession of a beautiful spirit and/or a lovely family.\n\n2) Though when there is, and something interesting shows up in the CSF, I've found within myself a tendency to become a little overconfident. Given enough serotonin, I begin to undo the top 6 buttons of my shirt and slap coffee out of the hands of interns. Surprisingly, I never acted like this back in residency. The mask has been slipping.  \n\n3) this hasn't happened terribly often, but it has happened more often than anyone would like\n\n4) But not always. The single best one I've ever gotten was \"RECTAL NUMBNESS.\" That's it. Aside from the patient's room number, that was the entire page. Also, yes, they did have a cord compression.\n\n5) My shoulders would have been slumped, and it would have been raining, and The Lonely Man would have been playing probably.\n\n6) My theory is that this circuit - if we could only find it - would confirm not only that a higher power exists, but that its possesses an 6 dimensional, extra mean sense of humor.\n\n7) Picture how Patton stood during his famous speech, and then imagine the diametric opposite. Try it right now. I guarantee you that even if they were in another room or state, your significant other just went into a fugue, grabbed their phone, and began to download Tinder.",

    "text": "Tasmanian Devil delivers a breech baby vaginally, and I lived to tell about it. I have to tell you guys this story, cause I can’t even believe it myself.  It's long as fuck.  Cheers.\n\n\n\nFor you in the OB world: tonight my meth-addled patient involuntarily pushed out a frank breech baby under conscious sedation. If none of that makes sense to you, keep reading, dear Redditor: it will.\n\nIn my 16 years as an L&D nurse, this night takes the cake.\n\n\n\nSo, coming on at 7pm it’s a little busy, but we don’t exactly need roller-skates yet…. I get report from Nurse 6th-Shift that there’s a patient coming up from ED. She presented to the ED with abdominal pain two days ago. They took one look at her mental health history (schizophrenia) and apparently decided that everything that came out of her mouth would be lies. She told them she was 37 weeks pregnant. So they did a chest x-ray, and an ultrasound that showed she was 33 weeks pregnant and then discharges her schizophrenic ass to the street.\n\n2 days later, she shows up back in the ED, and in the interim, she’s managed to find enough methamphetamine to blast her into florid mania. My report from 6th-Shift was “well, in the same 3 minutes she told me she is the Queen of Hawaii, an attorney, and that her parents owned the hospital.” Also, that her baby is alive, and that her mania turns into belligerent violence about every 5-7 minutes.\n\n“I told the ED doc that I can’t tell whether she’s in preterm labor or not because she tried to punch me.  I told them she should probably come up to L&amp;amp;amp;D so we can figure it out.” After 2.5 hours of this patient raising holy hell in the ED, they joyfully but slowly bring her up to us.  Excellent call, Nurse 6th-Shift.\n\nSpoiler alert: the patient delivered 2 hours later.\n\nTo my endless delight, the one thing that the ED doc did correctly in this situation was to order 2 mg PO Ativan, and 5mg IM Haldol. Bless his heart, he couldn’t figure out to send her up to L&amp;amp;amp;D for evaluation of her abdominal pain, but he sure as fuck could snow her for us.\n\nGood man.\n\nShe arrives curled up and filthy on a stretcher.  She is somnolent, but cooperative enough that we’re able to herd her onto the labor bed.  Just after the exasperated ED nurse leaves, the patient suddenly becomes very animated. “I gotta PISS!!!!” Writhing in the bed, clutching her belly: she is the very picture of labor. I put a hand on her rock-hard abdomen and my stomach drops to my knees.  At this point, all I know is: she had an ultrasound 2 days ago that put her at 33 weeks. In the 2 minutes since I met her, I am certain: she is going to deliver a preterm baby very soon.   Our one-bed well-baby nursery is woefully unprepared to care for a 33 weeker.\n\n60 seconds later, her contraction ends and she is snoring again (bless that man).  I swallow my moral outrage at checking an unconscious woman’s cervix, and find her to be 4cm dilated.\n\nAnd, fucking breech.\n\n(For those of you outside the OB world: Breech babies are NOT born vaginally. The risk of head entrapment is terrifying: the head is the biggest part of a baby’s body. This can quickly turn into dead baby hanging out of a vagina and that’s not a good look on anyone. So, any baby who is breech is universally born by c-section.)\n\nWhere were we?  Oh yeah: 33 weeks, breech, and psychotic with contractions.\n\nAs I jump up off the bed to start sounding the alarms, I see I now have a handful of meconium.\n\nNot meconium-stained fluid… Frank meconium. From a frank breech baby who is now pooping into its mother’s vagina.\n\nNow the score is up to: meth-induced preterm labor, breech, and meconium. This is the worst hat trick in the OB world. Fuck my life.\n\nSo, we start making plans to ship her out.  We gotta transport this train wreck to a facility that can care for a preterm baby.\n\nI call the community on-call Dr. LaLa to report our hat trick, and after her telling me 8 different ways that we just need to c-section her and ship the baby, I say “well, why don’t you (STOP FUCKING TALKING AND) head in here, and we’ll have some more information when you get here.\n\nIn the background, volume 10: “I GOTTA PISS!!!!” I run back into the room to keep the patient from tearing her IV out as she barrels for the bathroom like a bull with its balls in a pinch. I also discover that she is dribbling copious amounts of undiluted meconium down her legs, has wiped it on the siderail, and has generally made a baby-poo finger painting out of everyone and everything in the room. Pretty sure I have some in my hair.\n\nBy the time Dr. LaLa waltzes in, it is clear to everyone on the unit that not only is this lady not going to stay pregnant long enough to make it to the helicopter, she isn’t going to stay pregnant long enough to make it into surgery. Also, she is almost completely unresponsive in between contractions and definitely cannot consent to surgery. Once Dr. LaLa catches up to speed on the very real mess that we’re all in, she says “Call Dr. Crusty, whatever happens - he can help.”\n\nOh great.   Good old Dr. Crusty. (we’ll get to how he earned that name later.)\n\nDr. Crusty has two states of being:\n\n1. Look up the word “doddering” in the dictionary. His grinning face is the damn centerfold. It would be cute, if he wasn’t a surgeon. He dodders at everything. Walking, dictation, perineal repair, sharp dissection… I’ve seen him lacerate two babies’ faces in c-sections and yet still he is somehow in practice.  The OR techs give him the biggest needles they can find because he can't see the smaller ones.  He has a legit parkinsonian shuffle.  I could go on for days...\n2. His other mode is: \"8 SEMI-CONFLICTING ORDERS AT ONCE! JESUS CHRIST YOU INCOMPETENT NITWITS MOVE FASTER!\" His trauma response is to become consummate prick with snide, passive-aggressive remarks about our nursing skills that everyone just lets slide because he’s delivered most of this rural area’s babies for the last 40 years.  He reminds us, constantly, how much experience he has, and how good he is at doctoring.  That said, he is actually amazing at some stuff, and will accept chickens and lawnmowing in payment for his services, so I am conflicted about talking shit about him.\n\nBack to the scene:\n\nWe rush back to the operating room, and I scoop her onto the OR table between her wild contractions. Every 4 minutes, she becomes the Tasmanian Devil: writhing, howling, and grunting. I half-sprawl my body across hers to keep this tornado of a person from whirling right off onto the floor. Once one particular 60-second storm subsides - my dearest and actual most favorite anesthesiologist Dr. Diamond Rainbow pushes her mystical white light elixir of the gods into Taz’s IV.\n\nWe all felt a warm balm wash over us as the propofol solved quite a few of our problems.\n\nWith the Whirling Dervish asleep, we could turn our attention to more pressing things, like the half a baby butt peeking through this lady’s labia. (It was a girl, BTW. It was labia in labia. Labiaception for a minute.)\n\nI love Dr. Diamond Rainbow with every fiber of my little nurse heart. She somehow waved her magic wand and settled this patient into a sweet peaceful place: somewhere between methamphetamine, Ativan, Haldol, Propofol, Versed, and Fentanyl…a delightful rainbow of medications…  Taz was able to sleep soundly, but keep her reflexes intact.\n\nMaintaining just enough anesthesia for our Tasmanian Queen of Hawaii to protect her airway... meant she also retained the Ferguson Reflex.\n\nFor those of you who’ve never pushed a baby out: you know that feeling you get when you take a satisfying shit, your face contorts a little and your body goes into an animal hrrrrrrrrnnnggggg… and then you eject a pound and half of yesterday’s tacos? Yeah, that’s actually a reflex.  When you have a 5lb 10oz baby far enough down in your pelvis, your body knows just what to do with it.\n\nYeetus.  That.  Fetus.\n\nSo, the patient slept, and every 3 minutes would push quite effectively. I got to watch Dr. Crusty coach Dr. LaLa through a really lovely breech delivery. Out of hundreds of deliveries I’ve attended in 16 years as an L&D nurse - this is the third breech extraction I have ever witnessed.  Hat trick turned Triple Crown.  I felt like I was witnessing history, with that posterior shoulder delivery.\n\nOh yeah, back to Dr. Crusty.\n\nI’m tucked in against the patient’s hip, feeling her belly for contractions with one hand, and searching with the doppler for heart tones with the other, when Dr. Crusty yells out “Puje!!! Puje!!!” Which is Spanish for “push”. Not only is the patient unconscious, she is Hawaiian, not hispanic. I turn to glare at him over the patient’s draped leg, and see through his goggles that he hasn’t wiped last night’s sleep crust off his face. I catch his squinting, yellow-crusted gaze and mumble “she can’t hear you, Dr. Crusty. And she doesn’t speak Spanish.”\n\nAll’s well that ends well - the baby is fine, actually 37 weeks. The patient slept it all off and then ate everything in the fridge. CPS will be in later today to take her baby (also meth+ on Utox) to foster care, but for now she gets to coo and giggle at her cute little daughter. I took her an 8th cup of coffee before I left, with 6 sugars and 4 creamers, just the way she likes it.\n\n\n\nTL,DR: If a pregnant woman tells you she hurts anywhere between her nipples and her knees… it doesn’t matter how batshit insane she is.  Assume she is in labor, until proven otherwise.\n\n\nEdit: well this blew up.  Thanks for all the encouragement, guys.  I’ll keep writing if you keep laughing.  And, for the love, quit paying for fucking Reddit awards.  God bless /u/spez, but that dude doesn’t need your hard-earned money any more than I do.  Go donate $5 to The Bail Project.  If you PM me about it, I’ll send you a book when I’m done with it.",

    "text": "Doc said \"good job fisting grandma\" ER. Typical day. Full waiting room, ambulances lining up, phones ringing, call buttons being mashed like a Tekken game. I stroll into my assigned pod at the beginning of my shift with an ambulance already rolling in, medics eager to hand off and skedaddle.\n\nSacral pressure ulcer, fever, worsening fatigue. Sepsis? Sepsis. Standard order for a contracted bedbound elderly woman with 3 day a week home care and daughter as primary caregiver. She says her booty hurts. I bet it does. We'll check it out in a second. First, it's time for the ER special of 2 IVs, an 18g in the forearm and a 22g in the knuckle, cultures, antibiotics, COVID swab, the donut of truth, and consult to literally everyone that's ever sneezed near the patient and has an MD after their name.\n\nI grab the nearby ~~fresh meat~~ new grad nurse and say hey, it's time to clean grandma. Grandma finally had some pain meds and is in dilala land. Raul dutifully rolls contracted grandma, who doesn't notice because she's higher than the Wright brothers. Standard home care special, a dirty diaper that's saturated with urine, a few poop nuggets, a 3 inch stage 4 pressure ulcer I could stick my ^tiny fists in. Oh wait, what's that? A second ulcer? I see another large 4 inch hole just under the first sacral ulcer, but crusted with stool. A few nuggets must have escaped the booty and meandered on over to this second ulcer. I grab them with a bath wipe and gently remove the poop nuggets.\n\nAnd then I realize that isn't a sacral ulcer. It's a booty hole. She has a fecal impaction. And that's her rectum, stretched out 4 inches wide and full of rock solid poop nuggets that she can't squeeze out. Raul, the poor baby nurse, realizes this right after I do. He looks horrified. I think he might leave nursing and go become a hermit.\n\nGrandma is still high.\n\nI sigh, and with a gloved hand pick at the poop nugget mass. It's formed like monkey bread, individual balls of poop smushed together by the force of her gaping asshole. It tears apart quite easily, much like the monkey bread it's shaped like. Grandma groans a bit. I peel away the surface nuggets, hoping it's all just there at the edge. It is not. I can see an inch into her rectal vault, the forbidden monkey bread staring at me, her rectum still gaping. How much is in there? I can't leave her like this. How does her rectum hold that gaping shape? How long has she been like this? It's possible to stretch that much?\n\nI dig a bit deeper. It isn't a difficult task. Nugget after nugget is scooped out. Grandma says it feels better now. I keep scooping. My whole hand slips easily in without actually touching the walls of her intestines. I am wrist deep inside an elderly woman, making eye contact with a freshly minted nurse of just a few weeks, wishing I had finished my coffee before this so I could properly comprehend what was going on.\n\nAfter an eternity, I've scooped what looks to me to be about a pound or more of stool out of grandma. It's a scale bed, so I weigh her after. 1.3 lb difference. She says she feels much better. I'm sure she does. Her butthole appears to be shrinking down to a normal size, but I'm still concerned.\n\nThe doctor comes back in to evaluate the pressure ulcer, since I told him to wait until I've cleaned her. He looks at me, direct eye contact.\n\n\"Good job fisting grandma.\"\n\nI'm offered a fist bump. I decline. I go finish my coffee, and wonder what the next 11 hours of my shift will bring. Raul avoids eye contact with me for awhile.\n\nMerry Christmas, may your grandma not need to be fisted in the ER for a fecal impaction. And please, for the love of all things holy, give grandma a stool softener if she takes enough Percocet to make Future bat an eye. Otherwise she'll get disimpacted by an undercaffeinated ER nurse when trying to assess the pressure ulcer she acquired from family being too busy to turn her during the holidays.",

    "text": "I feel like a good nurse today I had a pt retaining urine, the bladder scanner was just reading more than 1L. I tried everything to make this woman pee, she was bed bound so I brought in the lift to get her to the commode and yayyyy 600ml! Awesome. I bladder scan again, still too much for the scanner to pick up. So I talked to her about straight cath. She screamed no, she was so scared. I had the doctor come talk to her (no small feat during night shift). I drew out diagrams of why this was dangerous. She still was refusing. At 6am I let her play with the catheter, and see how small it was, explained the procedure, everything. Finally she agreed to let me try, as long as another nurse held her hand. I pulled off 1700ml from her bladder. Wow.\n\nThe next night she kept saying over and over how much she appreciated my patience and explanation. How I was gentle when doing the procedure. How I listened when she didn't want the pure wick or a Foley. She called me her hero. I didn't know how to deal with that praise face to face, but I felt like I made her care better. Made her comfortable. And although I still freeze up with a code, or a seizure, 6 months out of college I feel like I did my job well for that pt. And I am a good nurse.\n\n\nEdit: I don't have time to thank everyone, but really thank you all.",

It stuck with me through codes and rapids and deaths of coworkers. \n\n\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n\nYou as a healthcare worker are a force multiplier. Your training and experience is invaluable moving into this crisis. So, you’re going to be faced with some very difficult moments. You’re going to have to put your needs first.\n\nI’m speaking specifically about PPE and your safety.\n\nIf you’re an ICU nurse, or an ICU doc, and you become infected, not only are you out of the game for potentially weeks (or killed). But your replacements could be people without your expertise. Your remaining co-workers are short staffed now, more likely to make mistakes and become ill themselves. You stop being a force multiplier and start using healthcare resources.\n\nYou going in may save the patient, it may not. But you cant save any patients in the weeks you’re laying in a hospital bed or using a vent yourself.\n\nPeople are going to die. Do not become one of them.\n\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n\nDuring the Ebola outbreak, people were dying. But at no point did we rush in, we took the 10 minutes to put on our PPE with our spotter. If we didn’t have proper PPE we did NOT go in.\n\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n\nYou may work in long term care, and want to rush in to save a patient you have had for years. Do not go in without your PPE.\n\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n\nYou may have a survivor in the room, screaming at you to come in because their mother is crashing. Do not go in without your PPE.\n\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n\nYou may have an infected woman in labor. Screaming for help. Do not go in without your PPE.\n\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n\nYou may have a self-quarantined patient with a gunshot wound who is bleeding out. Do not go in there without your PPE.\n\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n\nDoing nothing may be the hardest thing you’ve ever had to do in your life.\n\nMany of you say, I could never do that. I wouldn’t be able to stop myself from rushing in and saving my patient.\n\nLiberian nurses and doctors said the same thing, and many did run in to help, saying PPE be damned. My patients need me.\n\nThen they became infected, they infected others. And they died.\n\nThey didn’t help anyone after that.\n\nDo not let the deaths of hundreds of healthcare workers be forgotten.\n\nhttps://acanticleforlazarus.com/2020/03/23/there-is-no-emergency-in-a-pandemic/",

    "text": "They said she had a panic attack. I am livid. Last night while I'm getting report we hear a crash and patient starts screaming out for help. We have to push the door open because her daughter, who was visiting, collapsed in front of the door. She's having a full on tonic-clonic seizure. Face down, not defended whatsoever, all four limbs convulsing, not responding or following commands for about a minute. The patient says her daughter doesnt have a history of seizures and that she hit the wall hard when she fell (which we could hear). The visitor comes around and is completely post ictal, babbling and yelling and attempting to stand. Four minutes of us trying to keep her head an neck stable til the stretcher arrives while she screams for her mom and fights us. By the time the stretcher and security were there she's calmed down enough to be wheeled to the ED unrestrained, we calm down the patient and report what happened to rapid response and the supervisor and go about our days again. I file the safety report thinking great, she's gonna end up right back here on the neuro unit for EEG. All in all good response from my team.\n\nFour hours later who should walk right back up to our unit to say goodbye to their mother, but that visitor. To say we were stunned was an understatement. The ED was packed right now, there's no way they got her scanned and discharged her already, right? She had to have left AMA. Nope, they discharged her. Told her what she had was actually a panic attack. A *panic* *attack*. Yeah, because panic attacks make you hit the wall like a tonne of bricks and convulse for a full minute. Panic attacks have long periods of post ictal confusion after, right? *Did they at least scan your head?* No. *Did they tell you to see a neurologist?* Nope. They gave her 1mg of po ativan (for the panic attack you see) and some fluids, then let her go. Told her she was fine to drive herself home.\n\nTo say I am disgusted with my hospital was an understatement. First off, for disregarding the report of a floor's worth of *fucking neuro nurses*. For fucks sake, we do long term EEG on my unit, I'm trained in the got damned neuro stepdown unit. I *think* I know a tonic-clonic seizure when I see one. The rapid nurse even asked if it could possibly have been faked, because that *had* happened in her experience and I told her flatly no, unless she's watched hours of videos of seizures (including post ictal confusion) and is a damn good crisis actor with little regard for her own health or safety, it wasn't fake. For what? That single mg of PO ativan? In front of her sick mother who was either getting rused as well, or in on the scheme? And like, this isnt my first rodeo, I've seen a faked seizure or two in my day. But nope, what I saw was just a panic attack, nothing more.\n\nYou might think incompetence is at play, and so did we when this woman who seized before our eyes was discharged to drive herself home.  But as jaded as the hospital has made me over the years, I have to look at it more cynically. Think of it from the doctor's perspective. The ED was packed. We had to open a temporary surge unit to transfer walkie-talkies to, so that the sicker ED patients could get floor beds. And you just had one more wheeled down, right from visiting the inpatient units. She looks fine, and we just filled the last neuro bed. And look at this, how convenient, a *woman* with a history of anxiety. We can empty one of these ED beds right now if we give her some Ativan \\*for her anxiety (\\*that will ALSO conveniently keep her from seizing on her drive home) and send her on her way without so much as a scan to check for bleeding after her fall. She probably wont have another seizure til she's well beyond our care, and can deal with it then. *We're just too busy to take care of this patient.*\n\nI'm practically numb right now. I both can and cant believe that our hospital would put someone's life at so much risk, intentionally or otherwise. What if the next time she seizes she's at the top of a flight of stairs? Or behind the wheel of a vehicle? What if she hits someone, what if she crashes? They didnt care, they just wanted one less patient crowding the ED. Everyone on the floor urged her to go to her doctor. We had to be the ones to tell her what happened, as she had no memory of the event from speaking to her mother, to sitting on the stretcher being wheeled downstairs. She believed the doctors when they told her, \"You're just too anxious.\" She trusted them, maybe still trusts them and just thinks we are overly worrisome nurses.\n\nI just... don't know what to say. I witness travesties every day at my job. But it helps you suffer through when you know that everyone around you is doing everything they can to help, to make people's lives better. When you realize some people just dont care the way you do, are willing to lie to someone and put their life at risk, it makes this profession feel hollow and bitter.",

    "text": "Oh look, another post talking about how nurses are sociopaths Every two weeks on r/unpopularopinions there’s a post about how nurses are bullies and sociopaths and what follows is a hoard of comments from people frothing at the mouth claiming their neighbor’s girlfriend’s sister is a nurse and she’s a bitch. Here’s an unpopular opinion that’s gonna be hard for them to swallow: they’re sociopath patients and most nurses are fine. I’ve been doing this since 2017 and can honestly say I have only met one bitch nurse. \n\nThese people are like ultimate gaslighters. The doctor DC’s their narcotics and then leaves it to us to inform the patients who then scream at us and throw things because of situations out of our control. I just had a patient yesterday throw an entire bedside commode and scream at me because the doctor decreased her narco. I’ve had patients backhand me and spit on me because I’ve given them injections. I’ve had patients try and claw my eyes out and scratch my face up because I’m trying to given them their pills. One guy screamed at me and called me a bitch and threatened to kill me because I caught him smoking in his room while he was on 6L of oxygen and confiscated his cigarettes. I’ve been groped, sexually assaulted, and sexually harassed. A few weeks ago a woman called me incompetent, told me I needed my nursing licenses taken away, and accused me of trying to kill her because I crushed her pills per her doctors order and didn’t separate them for her. She literally phoned my supervisor from her room and reported me. \n\nOh and the whole neglect thing? Maybe if nursing homes had more than 3 nurses for 80-100 patients then we wouldn’t be so rushed trying to get to the next patient. Maybe advocate for better patient staff ratio with better pay and we wouldn’t miss that your grandma is a little chilly.  Literally all of us feel bad when we miss something; but missing something doesn’t make us sociopaths it makes us human. I’ve been accused of being neglectful because I didn’t call this woman at exactly 7:05 to tell her her daughters vitals for the day. \n\nAnd then we get these people going on Facebook bitching about how their “nurse just wants me to be in pain all night and she’s such a bitch” when the doctor DC’s their tramadol and then we get posts talking about nurses being bitches and the stigma of nurses being bullies continues as if there isn’t safeguards in place to make sure patients aren’t hurt, neglected, over/under medicated, harmed, or assaulted. \n\nI’m so tired of it.",

    "text": "I'm so sick of being abused by patients. I might actually leave the bedside over it I've been a nurse for 3 years. I used to be empathetic and tolerate people's bs because you know, trying to walk in other peoples shoes and stuff.\n\nThis past summer, I have already been filmed by two family members. All in one shift yesterday, I was called \"a fucking bitch\" for trying to just do my job and COVID swab a patient after I fucking politely explained why it's necessary. I was trying to help a creepy old man using a urinal and he said \"it's been a long time since a woman touched my pecker\" to which without even thinking about it I said \"well i'm certainly not doing it for free\" and he went off on me and told me to get the fuck out of his room. Another woman loudly complained about me doing her IV because she was a hard stick and apparently that makes me a bad nurse.\n\nI'm so sick of being yelled at for doing my job. I'm sick of patients treating me like I'm an incompetent and horrible nurse because the IV hurts, or the COVID swab hurts. So it must mean nurse = bad, right? I'm sick of the abuse because antivaxers are mad they still have to wear a mask in the hospital. I don't make the rules here, Karens. Talk to the CEO who makes $2million a year, not me, a lowly peasant. And honestly, I'm sick of being everyone's bitch. So many other departments call me to tell the doctor this, or fix that. No, YOU call the fucking doctor. They have phones too. I'm sick of patients treating the ER like it's a fucking burger king drive thru, then they take it out on me.\n\nI actually somewhat enjoy being a nurse. I love taking care of really sick patients. But patients and their families are so abusive, over asinine shit like linens were on the floor meanwhile I was taking care of your bed bound dad during a busy assignment. I'm sick of patients who could have easily been seen at urgent care, ringing the call light 100x an hour for apple juice and coming up to the nurses station again and again for it while I have a fucking septic workup that should have been in the ICU 7 hours ago but they have to get transferred out. They don't respect us nurses, or even like us.\n\nI'm burnt to the ground. Healthcare is all I have ever known. I volunteered in healthcare in high school, and the minute I graduated started nursing. I grew up semi-poor and it was the most feasible option for me to survive. Yes, I can afford to survive, help my family, buy fun expensive toys. I am absolutely blessed that I got into this career and can survive. But 3 shifts leave me feeling like an empty husk of a person, so there's that. I'm super jealous of my friends who went to four year schools, got the real college experience and make way more than me working on computers all day.\n\nSorry, it's been a horrible week. Wine and midnight mozzarella sticks can't fix this one.\n\nEDIT: Shout out to the patients and families who have basic human decency! I will always fluff and puff you, give you extra warm blankets and all the crackers and turkey sammiches you want!",

This is The Cranky Runner reporting live from the cesspool of conspiracy theories, anti-vax drivel, and open hostility to anyone who dares to believe in science. I have just received the latest news that our pathetic, toxic, flaming dumpster fire of a hospital is now completely at capacity due to the totally predictable influx of COVID positive patients in our not-so-fair city. Therefore, the ER is simply sending them home and writing orders for home health to somehow magically shit out at-home cures for these people.\n\nYet, at this VERY fucking moment in time, management from my little home health company has decided to attend a hospital board meeting to voice their extreme displeasure at the recent revelation that our hospital will require vaccines for all employees. I am the only member of management (yes, in addition to seeing patients, I am also the clinical manager) who will not be attending. I refuse to participate in this metric fuckton of pure, unhinged balderdash. \n\nWe are hearing about some of our patients dying in the fucking hallways of the ER waiting for a bed. I was forced to admit one horrendously unfortunate woman to our services who was, quite literally, suffocating before my eyes with a doctor's order that EMS was not to be called. We are seeing the COVID long haulers, with pneumonia that won't resolve, with scarred lungs and other longterm damage, who simply can't get back to baseline.\n\nBut get a vaccine for this atrocious, brutal, life-threatening virus? Oh, no. We just can't fucking do that. Nevermind the fact that vaccine mandates for healthcare workers is absolutely nothing new. I am watching what seemed to be perfectly sensible people transform into drooling, hopeless morons with little more than a functioning brainstem.\n\nAnd I care for these people. I actually like some of them. But I am dangerously close to shouting at all of them to go sit bare-assed on the nearest fucking cactus and to get the fuck out of healthcare since they obviously don't trust science. \n\nI am going home. I will either go run 5 miles to hopefully outrun this unbridled rage I'm feeling, or I'm going to sit at home, sip whiskey, and stew. I haven't decided yet. Stay tuned for more tales from this stinking, flaming hot garbage, pathetic excuse of a town.",

    "text": "Patient's son quipped at me to \"do something else if I hate my job so much\" **Context:**\n\nI work in an Emergency Department of a busy city hospital in Australasia that services a predominantly low socioeconomic community with high needs.\n\nEVERYONE comes to the ED for just about anything from minor complaints that are best dealt with in primary care to your actual emergencies.\n\nLast night our waiting area was heaving with 30 patients at midnight with no flow and we had patients who still hadn't been seen by nurses or doctors since 2000hrs. We had no more beds inside ED for patients that require assessment spaces.\n\n**Storytime:**\n\nI see this 80 year old man at triage who has not opened his bowels for the last 4 days, complaining of moderate abdo pain but has had no vomitting . His elderly wife is insisting he needs to be in the ED after speaking to a telehealth triage nurse who told them to come straight to the ED 😑.\n\nI proceeded to advise them that the waiting time to actually get seen by a doctor won't be until after 8am given the fact that our department is clogged up with unnecessary presentations and equally unwell people in the resus and monitoring areas.\n\nThe wife obviously gets mad at the long waiting time, by this time my voice is already louder and short because trying to explain you have no control over the waiting time is just not comprehensible to this woman. She then demands to her grandson to call the telehealth line again in an effort to get them to tell us to somehow hurry up and see the patient ASAP. I then explained to her NO ONE HAS ANY CONTROL of how long a waiting time is in AN ED. She then says, \"we'll just call an ambulance\" to which I respond with \"that won't make a difference - just because you come in an ambulance doesn't mean you get seen quicker.\"\n\nI spent about ten minutes with this woman to explain people get seen on the basis of how sick they are and unfortunately her husband likely has constipation. By this stage they call her and the patient's son in, and cue the absolutely condescending manner of speech this man gave me.\n\nHe basically explains why they're there, and I'm trying to tell them, I'm merely explaining to your mother how long the waiting time is, and if they're prepared to wait. The reason the teletriage nurse said to come in to ED was a manner of being cautious in case it wasn't a constipation but a bowel obstruction. He basically insults the skills of the teletriage nurse and then says to me \"if you don't like doing your job, then maybe you should do something else\".\n\nI shook my head at his comment and basically looked up at him and dead in the eyes I said \"we're all doing our best here with that we've got. Would you like to be in my position?\". Whether he actually had any understanding on the amount of pressure we were in or still held onto the belief of self importance, I will never know. He however did not say anything after that comment.\n\nI am seriously so sick of these people. I've basically reached a point where I cannot help but talk back at these kinds of comments. I hate to admit it but it bothers me that people insult us and yet when they need help they come running demanding to be seen ASAP. I feel like these are the kinds of people who treat nurses like their personal maids.\n\nJust needed to vent to people who hopefully will be more empathetic to what I'm dealing with.\n\nedit: formatting and grammar",

    "text": "Ya'll ever just want to have a heart-to-heart with a physician who clearly hates their job and doesn't care anymore? I work nights, and got a new admit close to midnight. 80-something-year-old lady with a sacral decubitus ulcer, intermittent confusion, sobbing hysterically about how much pain she's in. So I go look at the MAR and...nothing PRN has been ordered. Like not even Tylenol. But hey, it's all good, the same doctor who admitted her is also taking his calls tonight! Should be easy enough to get her something, right?\n\nI call around 0030. Straight to voicemail. Call again about 30 minutes later...straight to voicemail. Keep in mind, this woman has been LOUDLY sobbing in pain for the entire time. I call again 20 minutes later, and what do you know? Straight to voicemail.\n\nAt this point my charge gets the Nursing Supervisor involved. They call his house not once, but \\*several\\* times. Finally, around 0300, he calls me back. He was very clearly sleeping the entire time and had his phone turned off. He also very clearly was irritated with the situation.\n\nAnd I just wanted to sit down with him and be like, \"Look. I get it. Being a doctor isn't what you thought it would be. You are burnt out, and resentful of everyone here, including the patients, but you can't just stop being a doctor -- you're kind of in it now. I \\*totally\\* understand that, and honestly, I feel you to a degree. But if \\*you're\\* the doctor on call, then I need you to answer your phone. There is literally nobody else I can go to. Trust me, I would if I could. You think I enjoy sitting for hours for you to return my call while you're just trying to sleep and ignore the awful world around you? No, I do not. But I can't really change the situation. So we both have to suffer through it. So, ya know. Keep your phone on next time.\"\n\nI try to empathize with everyone, but goddamn man. You could've just thrown in a few PRN medications before you left and everyone would've been much happier. \n\nWorking in healthcare is frustrating.",

    "text": "Bias and prejudice against male Nurses Sexism against Nurses is a very old topic and both male and females are affected in a different way. Some woman dont want to be touched by a male Nurse or let their kids be touched by a male Nurse. Some people dont see you as a \"real\" Nurse. I mean I finished Nursing school like all my female coworkers and my ID Card says \"Krankenpfleger\" (Im german, thats the german Term for Male Nurse).  But to that I am used to. Specially in older Generations Nursing is a strictly female Job. Some old people are like \"oh they are male nurses? Oh well, modern times\" and then treat me like they would every nurse. But I got called gay for working \"a womans Job\" back in nursing school or I was asked If I failed to get into med school. Im used to this. The reasons Im ranting here happened today.\n\nIm an ER Nurse and today I transferred a patient to the cardiology and I met two residents. \"Just a nurse huh? To stupid for med school, huh?\". His buddy laughed and I get him the stare. Its my stare I use in the ER when patients getting loud. Its a stare that says \"rethink what you just said\". I got an half assed apology and got told to \"accept a joke\". This really pissed me off today. Sure I dont have a fancy medical school degree, but I work directly with the patients. And normally there is respect between doctors and Nurses. We respect our Jobs. MDs doing the diagnosis and have to make tough decisions.  But we do most of the work on the patient. And I really hope this two residents get eaten alive by this snake pit of a hospital (I love my Job btw.).\n\nIm writing this after my eight hour dayshift (we work five eight hour shifts instead of twelve hours shifts like the most nurses in the USA). Im glad I got that off my chest. To all my male Nurses out there who faced similar things stay strong. And to all my coworkers around the world stay safe and stay strong. Get the shot, wear a mask and yadda yadda (No Im not an anti vaxxer, I got my two moderna shots in junary and february 2021, because my hospital was a Center of Covid care in the german state of Hessen).

    "text": "Mean nurses make me want to quit! My first time crying at work I recently started a new job in a general medicine unit in March.\n\nWhen I work night shifts, the charge nurse is usually this woman named Kate. Kate is lazy. Once they made someone else charge nurse, so she called in sick so she didn’t have to have her own patients. She only works nights because she says days are too busy (totally valid I guess).\n\nThe other night I had a bariatric patient who had q4h IV antibiotics for bacteremia. His saline lock fell out so he had no IV access. I’m new to hospital nursing, so I suck at IVs, and bariatric patients are a hard poke! I told Kate that the IV fell out and she was like “don’t even try to put one in. There’s no point. Just tell the doctor you can’t do it.” And I said ok, but later I saw one of my coworkers, Danielle, who is great at inserting IVs. I asked her to help insert the IV, and she actually got it in! So I was able to give him his IV antibiotics. All was well.\n\nUntil I hear later that Kate was pissed that I “went against her” and inserted the IV anyway. She was calling me “disrespectful.” Honestly that didn’t even occur to me. I just thought that this guy needed an IV, so I was at least gonna try to get him IV access. Is that such a crime?\n\nSo ideally during nights if we need help with a brief change or something, we are supposed to ask our break partner. My break partner was Danielle. \n\nAt some point during the night, a call bell rang. It wasn’t my patient, but everyone seemed busy so I answered it anyway. The patient had a BM so I changed him (and his soaker pad and gown) by myself. \n\nLater I saw Kate walking with another nurse, Mila, in the hallway. The patient I changed was Mila’s and I wanted her to know he had a BM. I said “hey Mila, Mr. X in room 37—“ then I was cut off by Kate, who was yelling at me saying “why are you asking Mila to help you? Don’t you know Danielle is your break partner? Ask her!” I tried to explain that I wasn’t asking for help, but Kate kept talking over me so I couldn’t explain myself.\n\nLater, Danielle asked Mila to help her change a patient. Kate yells at her too for not asking me, her break partner, to help instead. Danielle said I looked busy. So they get into a bit of an argument. Then Kim says “You and survivorbae aren’t following the rules about asking your break partner! Stop going against my rules! It’s so disrespectful! Survivorbae tried to get Mila to help her with Mr. X, blah blah blah.”\n\nI tried to explain that I wasn’t asking for help. But again, she kept cutting me off and screaming over me. Eventually I got in “I changed Mr. X by myself”. And Kate goes “IF YOU CHANGED HIM YOURSELF AN HOUR AGO WHY ARE YOU ASKING MILA FOR HELP CHANGING HIM AGAIN?” She still wasn’t listening to me! It was exhausting trying to explain myself with her screaming, and normally I would drop it, but I didn’t want Kate to think I was disrespecting her rules as she kept saying. \n\nFinally, I explained that I was just trying to give report to Mila, not ask for help. Danielle says to Kate, “see, you were mistaken” and Kate goes “I WAS NOT MISTAKEN. I’M NEVER MISTAKEN. YOU AND SURVIVORBAE ARE SO DISRESPECTFUL, I’M GONNA TELL THE UNIT MANAGER”\n\nI went to empty a patient’s foley and just started bawling. I didn’t understand what I did wrong and it was so shocking to be yelled at this way. I had to go to the bathroom for 10 minutes and splash cold water on my face, but I still looked like I was crying. I was able to suck it up for the remainder of the shift, luckily.\n\nIn the morning I wanted to tell the unit manager but instead of being in his office, his was milling around talking to people. I didn’t feel like I could pull him away, plus I knew I was gonna cry and I didn’t want to cry in front of him.\n\nThen as I was giving report, another nurse was rude to me! This is already too long so I won’t get into it, but all of this makes me wanna quit!!\n\nTl;dr: Extremely rude, loud nurse yelled at me for inserting an IV and answering a call bell. I cried because I’m sensitive and now I wanna quit but I know I’ll get over it",

    "text": "PLS HELP RESTORE MY FAITH IN HUMANITY I just finished my first year as a bilingual Kindergarten teacher. I know what you're thinking... \"you signed up for hell when you chose Kindergarten\" but those sweet little psychos and their families are the only thing that kept me going this year.  \n\nThere are a lot of people involved in this so here is a key for who they are. \n\nU = other bilingual teacher \n\nP = director of human resources\n\nA = executive director of human resources\n\nG = superintendent\n\nK = principal\n\nB = vice principal \n\nJ = ESL specialist\n\nHere we go...\n\nAugust 2020 I thought I had found my dream job. I had moved back to my hometown where my parents have taught for as long as I could attend school. It was my dad's dream to one day get ready with his wife and daughter in the morning to all go to school to teach. So when he heard I got a job in the same district they teach in, he literally got tears in his eyes. (He was a computer teacher...so, he doesn't cry much. Lol) I had been collecting bilingual books since college and I wanted to teach at a Title I school where I could help where the most help was needed. So.... literally my dream job. \n\nSkip to October 2020, the kids have now been in school about a month. I was loving it..masks, desk shields, and all. October 14th was one of my students' birthdays; one day before mine. We celebrated and I had let the birthday boy pass out his cupcakes WITHOUT A MASK UGHHH. (Later, they asked people in charge of COVID stuff if my class had to quarantine and they said no bc it wasn't long enough of an interaction) Anyways... It's October 15th, 6:00am and I get an email from birthday boy's mom that he has COVID. rip. I come rushing into school asking what I'm supposed to do, contact tracing, etc. The nurse asks if we followed protocols & I responded yes except for the cupcake incident. But I told her to check with U , the other bilingual teacher, because she posted a video of the kid with two other kids sitting together without a mask on Seesaw. (We switched classes and taught each other's classes daily)  I go tell U to expect the nurse because my student has COVID and she freaks out bc she never has her mask on either. \n\nThen, I get called to a meeting with the nurse, U, and K (the principal). K tells us that two of my students will have to quarantine because U could not confirm that she asked the students to put the masks on within 15 minutes. We're sent back to class and I get an email about another meeting with K and U during my planning time. I go and K lets me know that U has concerns. Apparently, U has been feeling for a while that our students' parents are comparing us and that I am purposely trying to make her look bad. I tell her that I was just trying to give the kids as much resources as possible and didn't mean to make her look bad. She loses her shit and yells that she can't trust me and that I just want to be better than everyone. K tries to calm her down and then it's time to go pick up the kids from specials. I finish my day feeling really freaking confused and get an email about AN AFTERSCHOOL MEETING. I sit throught another meeting where U compares me to a 17 yo highschool girl (I am 22 and she was in her 50s). I am not exaggerating when I tell you that this woman stalked my SEESAW ACCOUNT to see if anyone had their masks off and was ready to show a file-folder portfolio of it and then proceeded to SCREAM that I'M a traitor. I couldn't get a word in because K proceeded to YELL AT HER to be quiet and stop talking ...no college program or professional development could have prepared me for what was happening before my eyes. Then, the lord answered my prayers and K told me that I could go so that her and U could have a private conversation. \n\nEventually, K tells me to try to be considerate about how my relationship with parents could be hurting U. Despite my own morals, I stop sending as much resources out. Meanwhile U has been at work on the other 4 Kindergarten teachers on the team. She tells them how I'm a traitor and that I think I'm better than all of them. I try to still interact with them but they start leaving me out of things and eventually have their own group chat without me. \n\nA few weeks later, I share with a colleague that I have known since I was 5 that I feel like I'm being bullied. That colleague shares it with K, the principal. The kindergarten team has to have a meeting with K because two other teachers were verbally fighting in the hallway. But, they had already beefed it out so the attention turns to me. Except I had NO IDEA we were about to talk about why I felt bullied. This was basically an opportunity for the other teachers to openly shit on me for having a \"communication problem with my teammate\" and for not \"socializing enough\". \n\nAt this point, my anxiety (which is usually controlled by medication) was off the rail and I felt completely alone. I went to see my doctor and she upped my dose and gave me additional meds which gave me KILLER side effects. I had to absent a few days. Because of the shortage of substitutes, the teachers had to split my kids up and this gave them more reason to hate me. FML. I come back and K has a meeting with me to tell me my team was upset with me because of my absences. I explained that I was having major side effects from the meds and I told her why I was anxious lately. She said she would push my eval date to later because she wasn't sure if I would be ready.  A week or so later I get a \"coin of excellence\" from  superintendent G because my students' parents are writing him emails about how happy they are. Soon enough, K calls me into her office and tells me she doesn't think she will consider me for rehire. I tell her that I would love to work on whatever it is she wants but I need specific examples of what she wants me to do. THESE WORDS WOULD COME BACK AND BITE ME IN THE ASS.  \n\nIt's now the day of the holiday party (right before our Thanksgiving/Christmas break). Our class is supposed to watch the Polar Express and I've created the cutest lesson to go with it where the kids create a book of tickets with a kind word for each of their classmates. One of the other teachers got sick and left so I had 5 of her kids come into my classroom that had no more chairs left. I get them settled and the kids continue working on the activity and watching the movie.  Then K and B (vice principal) come busting in. K tells me that B will watch my class and that I'm going to follow her. K tells me to take a look at my class and then she walks me outside of the room. She then proceeds to walk me to the other monolingual kindergarten teachers rooms and audibly says, \"THAT'S what I want you to do. That's what I want your class to look like\". The teacher was sitting at her desk on her laptop, the kids were all silent in their desks and watching the movie. She took my to the other classroom where it looked the exact same.. teacher at desk, silence, kids in chairs watching the movie. I tried to explain to her that I created an activity to go along with the movie but she told me to stop either the activity or movie immediately. We go back into my classroom where my students are literally rolling around the floor even though the vice principal was supposed to be \"watching them\". I get them to settle down and turn off the movie. K walks me around the room and points out everything that's wrong. Literally the definition of a Party Pooper. \n\nI've had enough at this point so I go to HR. My mom knew P (the director of HR) and assured me she would help. She was wrong. P listened and told me to sit down and have a talk with K after we return from the break. She also said she'd get me some district support since it sounded like I didnr have support at school. \n\nAfter break (January 2021) we have professional development before the kids come back. Things seemed fine with K and I was worried of stirring things up further. Things were NOT fine with K. She told me that J would now be in my class daily for about an hour to help me out. I thought this was for support until J ends up trying to boss me around and telling me that I'm not doing my job. That day I tell her to get out of my classroom because she is being a huge distraction to my students. If things aren't bad enough... I start getting a terrible cough. Eventually I have to leave early on a Friday because I feel really sick and completely lost my voice. Over the weekend, I have to go to urgent care and get a COVID test. The test comes out negative but the doctor is convinced it's a false negative...so, they write me a note and tell me I need to quarantine. I tell K, my team, and HR. HR then responds and tells me that my note doesn't qualify and that I will be docked after my remaining absences are used. I tell them that, in that case, I will be returning Monday. They then state that they will not allow me to return until I feel better... But, I will still be docked. That sounded like a bunch of balogna so I contacted my teacher union and she managed to get them to agree that if I can get a \"clearer note\" that I will get paid COVID leave. Please keep in mind that I'm dying of a fever and fighting off possible COVID. I call the urgent care enough to get them to pity me and they write \"due to covid symtoms\" on my note. Suddenly, those 4 magical words made my note \"qualify\". They give me the paid leave and I have about a weekend to recover until I have to go back. \n\nI get back to my classroom and someone has taken down all my students work in the hallway.     It's my first day back and K comes back \"for an observation\" and tells me how \"out of control\" my kids were while I've been gone. She tells me she'll need to meet for conference. During my conference time, she tells me how out of control my students have been while I've been gone. (Which hadn't been the case as evident by all the days that I had been texting with the substitutes) She then hits me with the, \"do you even want to teach kindergarten? Do you even want to be a teacher?\". I say, \"yes...I love teaching\". She responds, \"then you need to get better at it. It's not working out for you.\" She doesn't get enough time to shit on me because my students end up banging at my door because I was late to pick them up from specials. So, she tells me I need to meet after school. She tells me more BS and how she's not the only person that thinks I'm a terrible teacher. She says that my colleagues can never teach anything because of me, etc. \n\nI email superintendent G as soon as I leave the meeting and tell him to call me. He calls me that evening and I tell him everything. I'll give him props... He really had me thinking that he was going to \"fix\" this. He says that he wants me to continue in this district and that he would get A (executive director of HR) to give me a call and help me out. I tried to tell him that A was already biased because she was pissed about the COVID teacher union incident but he said it was fine. It was not fine. \n\nA ends up calling me eventually and tells me that she is going to tell me the exact same thing that P told me in November... To just sit down and talk to K about my feelings. I tell her I've tried but K is always aggressive and so she tells me to just try again. I email K at ungodly hours (because I'm not sleeping anyway) and tell her in the most professional way to please leave me alone so I have time to practice what she wants from me. So, she says that it's fine but proceeds to send in J to spy on me. \n\nI'm not taking that for an answer so I email superintendent G and tell him that I appreciate him sending me to A but K is now, by definition, harrasing me. He tells me to keep working with HR on the matter... But, he gets nervous so tells A to send me a discrimination and harrasment form so it can be investigation. Despite me telling him I'm uncomfortable with A doing the investigation, she is in charge of it anyway. \n\nIt is now mid February and have lost 20 pounds  (making me underweight), I have developed insomnia and the anxiety has turned into depression. Everytime the door to my classroom opens or I hear a knock, my heart races and I cry on the way to school every morning. I tell A that until she can assure me that I will not have contact with K, I am not returning to campus because I don't feel safe. She eventually agrees for B to be my \"point of contact\" instead of K while the investigation is going on. Those couple of weeks, I had to sit through meetings with B and U where U would just scream at me the entire time and B would try to calm her down.. but, they were the most peaceful I had ever had that school year because K was no longer harassing me. \n\nBut good things don't last, so A tells me that she has concluded her investigation and has found that all the adverse actions I have faced is due to my lack of success as a teacher. What did I expect? Soon, time for resignation approaches and I choose to resign for the upcoming school year. But, I'm still seeking justice bevause I cannot imagine another teacher (especially someone who doesn't have anyone experienced in their family) going through this hell. I talk to my teacher union but the dates of my membership makes them unable to help me with the situation so they refer me to the EEOC. I also get in touch with Workers Comp (who later calls me back and tells me that my principal was only trying to help and now I'm retaliating). But, EEOC tells me to continue documenting everything and to contact them again at the end of the school year. \n\nSkip to the last 3 weeks of school... K and B come down and tell me that I haven't scheduled my final appraisal so I'll have to do it now. I tell them I refuse because I've been asking for a different appraiser all year. They tell me that they will call HR and get it figured out. Later, B comes back and tells me that HR will also be at the meeting as witness and that we are meeting after school. I show up and managed to get all my ratings moved up  on the appraisal because of the evidence I present and K feels pressured since there are 2 witnesses. Then, A tells me that there are district employees that feel threatened by me so they are placing me on paid leave for the last 2 weeks. They take my keys, laptop, and that's it. I have to come pick up all my things about a week or so later and I'm not allowed to talk to anyone other than A (according to the letter the \"superintendent\" sent). I also talked to a school board member who says that what I went through was awful but there's nothing he can do. \n\nI can't get in touch with EEOC in my area but I have time for that... I still plan on bringing ally evidence to them as well. My current issue is that I just got 2 job offers and accepted one. However, when the new principal called K, she spewed all the same BS about me. So much for starting over... Like it wasn't bad enough she harassed me and ruined the year before. The principal wants to risk hiring me... But she admits that now she feels the need to have her eye on me. \n\nSo, that's why I'm here. All school year and summer I've been trying to advocate for this type of situation and show that WE DONT HAVE ROOM FOR THIS. There is already a HUGE teacher shortage... Why are you trying to get rid of the ones willing to come in and take the challenge?? And you wonder why retention rates are so high??? \n\nI am still being bullied by the district I grew up in and that my parents have served in for years and they're getting away with it. This is a shot in the dark... But I need help. What do you do when no one will listen? I have recordings of almost all of this...even when she said the infamous, \"Do you even want to be a teacher?\". And yes... I've showed this to everyone involved but they chose to ignore it. \n\nPlease help. \n\nLove,\n\nA heartbroken kindergarten teacher",

    "text": "Male students harassing female teachers Hi everyone.   \n\n\nThis is going to be the very first post I have ever made. It's long, not sure how to shorten it without leaving out a lot of context. Obligatory \"not a teacher\" and \"English not first language\". But I have found very little on this topic, and would like to ask for some advice, or just insight on if whether or not anyone has ever gone through something similar. So...here it goes.   \n\n\nMy longtime partner in life is a highschool teacher, teaching french in Costa Rica (French is an obligatory 2nd language in most schools over here) at a private school. Over the past 5 years she has received varying degrees of abuse from students, mostly verbal. She's a sweet, but tough person. She doesn't tolerate disrespect in her classroom and sticks to the rules, but is never rude or condescending to her students and really cares about all of them. She will socialize with them and interact with them but makes sure to keep clear boundaries (such as no hugs, no touching her, no sharing of personal details like Facebook, Instagram or any other kind of social media and no pet names), this to avoid any possible misunderstandings that could cost her job and career. You can imagine which ones I am referring to. Anything that could ever point to inappropriate conduct between a young, attractive teacher and students.   \n\n\nAnyways, taking the above into account, she's been having issues with 4 students ever since they started highschool. At first, both the school and her considered they were just kids being kids. They would throw a few insults at her or try to cross the above boundaries during the 1st and 2nd year. In the course of that time, they had various discipline issues, such as bullying other students, causing fights or failing their tests and not doing their tasks and homework.   \n\n\n3rd year starts. 2 of those 4 students molest and harass other female students. Parents threaten the schoolboard that if nothing is done about this, they will take their daughters out of the school. The usual case of \"nude pics\" being passed around and other cases cause 13 students to be transferred. School psychologists decide to implement \"mending procedures\" and \"positive action\" to talk to the students. They deny everything, or say that they feel like the school is harassing THEM instead. The parents of those 2 students back it up, so the school give them the benefit of the doubt and buries the whole thing as a case of over sensitive parents, and teachers (including my partner) not understanding the sensitive minds of young kids.   \n\n\nA few kids continue to leave the school, my partner starts to get catcalled by the 4 culprits, and any kind of disciplinary action against these students turns into a call to the principals office in which my partner is being told that she can't keep noting down her students for being kids. They're just confused and need to be explained nicely, not disciplined. Ok...so she tries that instead. This just evolves into them making fun of her, catcalling her a bit more and insulting her, to the dismay of other students and a few teachers who witness the entire thing. During this whole thing...she still keeps her composure...  \n\n\nPandemic hits, 1 year of rest from those students...and then this year starts...  \n\n\nDuring all of 2021, the same 4 students have so far barked at her on the school yard, followed her into different classrooms (that they are not a part of), interrupted her classes, brazenly insulted her, catcalled her and most recently stepped it up to threatening her, backing her up against walls, showing up behind her and whispering things into her ear and stating that they would find out where we lived if she dared speak up about any of it. They are now 17 years old...  \n\n\nShe has developed severe anxiety, ended up in the hospital due to a mental breakdown and has become increasingly afraid to return to school...  \n\n\nThe school offered psychiatric assistance and offered to open up a case against them. Which she accepted...only for the school to try to convince her to drop it immediately after since they were gonna graduate soon anyways.   \n\n\nThe school is no help, so she tried contacting other outlets, but every \"specialist\" on the matter either say she should feel flattered to have students catcalling her, or that the threats aren't real...they're just kids and she's the adult who should simply ignore them.   \n\n\nIdk what to do to help her. I've told her to quit and I will shoulder the expenses until we are able to find her something else, but she refuses to resign until she has found something else (hard during the pandemic). She feels humiliated, misunderstood and her mental health is in decline. Not a day goes by where she doesn't cry. But doctors and psychologists refuse to assist her...they say she's ok, and basically to get over it. Or just take an ungodly amount of pills to numb her. As a man in today's seemingly \"progressive\" world...I don't understand how no one will give a damn about a female teacher going through this with 17 year old, male students...in one year, they will be legal adults, taking part in the world. Mind you...these are highly privileged students, sons of doctors and lawyers too...  \n\n\nI hope anyone got this far...but if not...\n\n**tl;dr:** Have you, as a woman, ever been harrassed by male students and everyone around you simply played it down? What did you do? And what would you do if it was affecting your health and no one is willing to help?",

    "text": "Best options for transitioning from overseas teaching to US teaching (California specifically) Hi everyone!\n\nI am a 27 year old woman and I currently work in a bilingual program for an all boys private school in Bangkok, Thailand. It is not an international school (I previously worked for one), but it is accredited by Cambridge International, so I do not teach the Thai national curriculum, but a more “internationally” recognized one, I suppose. I have a BA in sociology with a minor in education, and I’m currently earning my M.Ed from University of the People. \n\nWhen I moved to Thailand nearly 4 years ago, I originally intended to stay for 1 year and maybe a year in South Korea and then move back to California to get my credential. However, life happened and I’m still in Thailand because I fell in love with living here and I got lucky and landed a job with a decent salary. This has fortunately allowed me to pursue more education and eventually licensure whilst living here. While I’m very grateful for this, I know there will be many hurdles I will need to jump through once I move back to the US (not anytime soon, although I’m mentally preparing myself for a sudden change given how bad the COVID situation has gotten in Thailand). I don’t think I’ll move back for another 4-5 years, but I’m a big planner.\n\nFirst, after I finish my M.Ed next spring, I plan to pursue licensure from either DC or HI through TeachNow/Moreland. I know that this isn’t the most impressive credential to obtain, but it works. And it’s the option I have living overseas. \n\nSecond, I also intend to get a second masters degree after I finish TeachNow, as I’m aware that University of the People is not regionally accredited, and I would like to possibly earn an Ed.D one day. Most doctorate programs I’ve seen require a regionally accredited masters. I’m leaning towards an MA in TESOL because I enjoy working with ELLs and all the students I’ve had in the past 4 years have been ELL anyway. I’m considering Fort Hays State because they provide endorsement.\n\nNow, for my questions:\n\n1. Has anyone transferred a credential that was earned through TeachNow/Moreland to a California credential?\n\n2. Can you start the credential transfer process overseas or must you be residing in the US?\n\n3. I know my teaching experience overseas might not count towards my salary in the US (unless I maybe move to an international school again), but can my experience here count towards clearing my credential?\n\n4. If I earn an MA in TESOL with endorsement, will that waive the ELL requirement in CA?\n\n5. While I know this is situation dependent to a degree.. I have a real fear of not finding any work in California because my experience might not be counted and by the time I’m in my 30s I might be considered “old” AKA harder to boss around. Should I have an OK time finding a job with ESL endorsement/MA in TESOL and a multiple subject elementary education credential or will I be in for a rude awakening?\n\n6. On a completely unrelated note, has anyone moved from working in public K12 education to higher education? What was that like and what area of higher Ed are you now in?\n\nThank you thank you so much in advance to anyone that reads this and helps!",

    "text": "I think I'm a serial job hopper, and I hate it. How can I find permanent work? Hi, there! I'm a 19 year old woman. I live in Albany, NY. I'm currently employed at a small store, and I've been here for almost a week. I absolutely love the store and its environment, and I really want to stay, but I'm not sure if I can.\n\nIt's a 4 mile commute to work, and since I don't have a car (Nor do I want one), I have to take the bus and then walk for an hour, since the store, genuinely, is in the middle of nowhere. I don't usually mind walking or taking the bus to work. I enjoy using public transport and walking especially. It saves money. Lately, however, the public transport system has been complete garbage. The bus just hasn't been arriving when I need to head to work (Which is about 7-7:30, since all my shifts start at 9). So I've had to take an Uber/Lyft down, which wouldn't be too bad if I didn't need to save money. This is not sustainable, and so I'm freaking out because I might need to quit.\n\nBefore this, I was a dishwasher. I quit 5 days in because, frankly, it was Hell.\n\nBefore THAT, I was a sales associate at a big chain hardware store. I was there for 4 months. Quit late August. Started out as seasonal and I eventually got a permanent part-time position as a cashier. The only reason I left was because I had developed a benzodiazepines dependency (This isn't a sob story, all of this is relevant). I also have schizoaffective disorder. That PLUS the dependency made me start losing it a little, so I had no idea what to do or what treatment my doctor would recommend and freaked out. Handed in my 1 weeks notice, and I think I left on a good note. My boss seemed upset to see me go and wanted me to stay, and I do wish I could go back. After everything got sorted and my doctor let me know I'd likely be fine to work (And because I hate being unemployed), I reapplied to a couple positions there because they're still hiring for other full-time and part-time positions, but I never heard back.\n\nI've had a couple side gigs which I use to fluff up my resume. I've had a small art gig going on since April 2019 that's still going today. It's not much, only got a couple clients now, but it's still work, and it's the longest gig I've held, so I put it on there. I also had a housekeeping gig, but it was only for a couple months. Looks nowhere near as good as the small art thing I have, though.\n\nFor the past 5-6 months, I've been trying to save up so I can get out of my current living situation. I don't want to go into detail because I dont know if it counts as a sob story, but it's really bad, and it's also why I'm kind of freaking out.\n\nThing is, you need a job to get money and save up. I can't get jobs and then quit them within one week and expect to get hired anywhere else. I don't put my job as a dishwasher on my resume, and if I quit this one, I won't put it on, either. I have the three other gigs to keep my resume look mildly acceptable, but since I won't be able to put my two previous real jobs, it'll make a one/two month-long gap in my employment. On top of that, once I do save up enough to get the hell out of here, I'll most likely have to quit any job I have here, since I'll be heading to a different state.\n\nI just really have no idea what to do. How can I get a job with that kind of gap in employment, and how can I expect to get a job with a resume that shows I don't stay on for very long? I don't expect or want to get anything high-paying or relatively skilled. I enjoy retail and customer service and, well, labor. But I just don't know how I'm gonna be able to get a job if it looks like I'm not able to hold one.\n\nAny advice? Thank you.",

So right now I work in retail/services which is fine, but it’s extremely hard on my body and doesn’t make a ton of money, so I’m looking for a bit of a change.

I’m starting to think I have undiagnosed ADHD and wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this while going through law school. \n\nMy symptoms: I cannot focus. I can’t. I like school well enough and don’t mind the work that I need to out in but holy hell.... every task is so daunting that I just avoid starting it all together. Exhibit A, my LRW final due Sunday night that I have not even started. I feel so overwhelmed by completely attainable tasks that I just procrastinate and avoid until the tasks become actually overwhelming and I’ve just dug my hole so deep. I almost feel depressed and anxious, but I was diagnosed with depression previously and (not cured) overcame that, but this doesn’t feel anything like depression. This isn’t just a law school issue; I saw it crop up during undergrad though I was definitely depressed for a good chunk of that so it was hard to distinguish between this feeling and depression. During my gap years, it wasn’t as prevalent because my job didn’t have my performing the type of tasks I do for school, but even during my application cycle I found myself panicking about the smallest tasks.\n\nI’m hesitant to bring this up to a professional for a few reasons: 1) I don’t have a primary care physician in my new town and don’t want a new one to assume I’m trying to get an Adderall script for school, 2) I’m a woman so ADHD is not as commonly diagnosed as it is for men (or young boys), and 3) I even have imposter syndrome for neurodivergence and am worried a doctor will tell me that I’m just lazy 🙃\n\nI hate to be a self-diagnoser but what little information I could find online about ADHD in adult women has led me to consider whether I actually have it.

    "text": "Yes, you do need an “If I go missing...” folder. Hello Ladies,\n\nIf you follow the news, I’m sure most of you at this point have heard about the murder of Sarah Everard. As a woman, it hurt to be reminded that even if you “do the right things”, someone can still take your life. \n\nAs a Black woman, it has been another reminder that we have to be our own advocates if we go missing. We will never have the same press coverage, we will never have the same demands for change. \n\nIn the event that you go missing, whether as a result of someone else or an accident, you need to have an “If I go missing” folder that will allow your family or close friends to get started on search efforts. Do not expect the police to even believe you are missing as they may decided that there isn’t enough proof and that you’ve simply left on your own. \n\nSo what should be in an “If I go missing...” folder?\n\n1. General information such as your name, commonly used nicknames, locations you frequently visit, routes you generally take, and general appearance description. Be sure to note any dental work that could be used to identify you. \n\n2. Usernames and passwords to all banking accounts plus a list all of credit / debit cards in your name. All of them. This will allow them to quickly find if your card has recently been used and where. EDIT: If comfortable, use a password management solution so that your information is never at risk for being accidentally stolen or accessed. There are several options and they are easy to configure and use. Remember, any sensitive information you have should be stored securely and not somewhere where it could be accidentally accessed or stolen. Whether that’s passwords, birth certificates, or social security cards. \n\n3. Recent photos of you. With and without makeup. Have all angles of your face, full body, and photos of items that are unique to you. People may not remember a face, but they may remember complimenting something you always wear. \n\n4. List of known associates. Coworkers, neighbors, that person you chat with at the store. List your personal connections and be sure to note any that should be of concern to your family. If you don’t know the individual, still say something like “Sometimes there’s a weird guy at the corner when I’m walking to work.”\n\n5. List of medications and your prescribing doctors. \n\n6. A list of things you would *never* do. Leave your children, be in a car alone with XYZ, etc. If there is anything that would be an immediate red flag to your family and friends, put it in there.\n\n7. Personal account login information. Social media, gaming, all of it. In the event you go missing and there isn’t an immediate lead, you want your family to be able to get access to those accounts without having to jump through hoops that could take weeks or months. EDIT: Again, try to use a password management solution that allows you to securely share access, if possible. \n\n8. DNA. Now you can’t really put this in a folder, but try to share the location of stored DNA. You can actually use some kits to store your DNA in your freezer should the need ever arise. This can especially be useful for families where some members may be adopted. If you can’t or don’t want to store DNA, then try to note your blood type.\n\n9. Fingerprint card and copies of all your IDs. Work, state, etc. \n\n10. Final notes to your loved ones. This can be a hard one. No one ever wants to think about the day they might not be here, but if you can, write any final notes or thoughts you’d want them to know, in the event you go missing and are not found. \n\nFinally, let’s talk about what to expect if you or someone you know has gone missing. First, the burden of proof will be on you to show that they are missing and didn’t leave of their own free will. Sometimes the police will care, but often they will not simply due to the number of missing reports that resolve themselves. Their lack of interest will rarely be malicious. It will simply be from being overworked, understaffed, underfunded, and leaning too much on “what normally happens”.\n\nSaying “this isn’t like them” isn’t enough. You need to be specific. Have they neglected to show up for an appointment? Have you already gone by their house? Is anything missing or out of place? Are they on a medication that if they missed taking could cause some serious consequence (e.g insulin).\n\nIf you are even slightly suspicious of foul play, you have to advocate for the person with all that you have. \n\nIf you or the person who has gone missing is:\n\nAddicted to drugs, has previously gone missing but was later found, says things like “I’m going to go away”, or has a history of disappearing without a word, then you must be prepared to be on your own. Still go to the police, but if they find any records to suggest they’ve left before on their own, they will likely assume that is what’s happening this time. \n\nIf you are that person, have that folder and have your “I would never” line. Something that lets your family and friends know that this isn’t the norm. If you know someone who is like that, then encourage them to make their own folder and also have their “never” line. \n\nLuckily, going missing or having a missing loved isn’t something most of us will ever have to go through, but because we live in the country that we do, we have to be prepared to help ourselves should anything happen. Make one for you, your family, and encourage friends to make one for themselves. Keep the information secure but easily accessible should the time come.\n\nStay safe out there, ladies!",

    "text": "Bummed out about life I just need a space to rant, where maybe people on Reddit will understand without blaming me.\n\nI am a 21 year old Black woman. I just completed my Bachelor’s from one of the top 10 schools in the US/world. I had dreams of becoming a doctor for as long as I can remember. I see the current state of things, however, and I just don’t think it’s worth it anymore.\n\nWhat do I mean?\n\nMy eyes have been getting opened to the way POC, especially Black people, are held down in this country since I was young. It gets frustrating, though, when that has to keep happening. I hate how deep it runs. Racism is in everything. We are still fighting for the same things our ancestors fought for years ago. \n\nI don’t want to sound like I’m giving up, but my whole family is finally getting to where I’ve been: It’s so exhausting fighting against the man. It doesn’t matter how much you achieve, it’s still there. To think we are almost to selling our 40-acre haven and just expatriating. Ugh, it just bums me out so bad. I want to cry.\n\nI also think about simple stuff, like how this farm down the road from my house has been in a white family for 7+ generations. That kind of generational wealth doesn’t even happen here. There’s no escaping it.\n\nI don’t hate being Black, but I really wonder. Why? Why have we been handed this deck of cards? It’s hard when people either negate your feelings or tell you to work harder. We do work hard! I constantly am getting taken advantage of for my hard work ethic. I don’t see it bettering the Black situation in the US. I don’t want my whole life to HAVE TO BE fighting for my people’s liberation. But generation after generation… \n\nHappy Holidays y’all from a tired Black lady.",

    "text": "The real reason I got sober. (TW: alcoholism, police brutality, racism, sexual assault) TLDR: Police brutality and racism is the real reason I decided to get and stay sober.\n\nLike most people my 2020 was absolute garbage, my quarantine started in January of 2020 after my landlords negligence in keeping the sidewalks shoveled caused me to break my leg while walking. Being in the service industry, I was unable to work for the entire month of February and during that time I would say that my alcoholism went from ‘moderate’ to ‘functioning’. I was stressed because I’m an active person that had to stop and sit overnight. I was drinking pretty heavily during that time because I was bored and depressed being out of work and watching the news about Covid and learning about the details of Ahmaud Arbery’s murder.\n\nBy the time I was back to work in March, Covid had really ramped up in the US and I worked for less than two weeks before the state of Minnesota shut down for quarantine. I did not handle it well, especially since quarantine started the same day that Breonna Taylor was murdered (we have the same first name including pronunciation), I had the news on in the background when her murder was announced and it really disturbed me to hear her name and all of the details of her murder. Like so many other Black people I’ve always had that fear of being murdered by the police for no reason, but to hear her name was my name was a feeling I never hope to experience ever again. Ahmad Arbery’s murder details were still emerging as well. I was also alone all the time as my husband was able to continue working and I was pretty much self-medicating in the only way I knew how.\n\nOn May 21, 2020 I was able to sober up just long enough to go to the store, on my way home a comedian on the comedy channel I was listening to was making rape jokes. As a survivor of rape I immediately flew into a PTSD rage, I’d been having suicidal thoughts for awhile, but that was the last straw. I started speeding, all I wanted to do was crash into at tree. I’m unsure what happened next, but my brain shut off and my body took over and the next thing I know I was parked outside of my home shaking uncontrollably, crying hysterically. I went into the house and confessed to my husband what I had tried to do, he immediately called my parents to come over. My Dad took me to the hospital, but because of Covid, he was told to leave as soon as we got to the hospital. I was alone and scared in a waiting room telling an intake nurse about the past two years of my life and what led up to me being suicidal, that would be the first of six times that I would have to tell that traumatic story in the next day and a half. I was then escorted by two armed policemen to my “room” where I had to take off my clothes, surrender all my belongings, and wear dark red scrubs. A doctor eventually came hours later and promised that I could go upstairs to receive help as soon as my Covid test came back negative. That was a lie. I spent all of Thursday night and all of Friday stuck in that room. The only silver lining was a good friend of mine was a nurse in the mental health ward and provided comfort for me and relayed information to my husband about what was going on. Friday night I told the staff that I wanted to be discharged. Instead, they finally sent me to the upstairs area (escorted by an armed police officer) at ten o’clock at night. I was finally able to take a shower and could relax a little and read a book, but not before I had to retell my trauma story again. On Saturday I demanded that I be discharged and was finally allowed to go home, only after my friend advocated for me to a sympathetic doctor who understood my frustration.\n\nMy husband picked me up and we ended up taking Chicago Ave. home, as we drove past Cup Foods I remember making a silly remark about how my brother used to shop there when he lived around the corner. I was drinking heavily again by Sunday night, and by Monday evening George Floyd had been brutally murdered.\n\nFrom then on my alcoholism went from ‘functioning’ to ‘non-functioning. I couldn’t deal with anything at all, I felt guilt at being suicidal, I was angry that another Black person had been murdered by police, I was furious that out-of-town white nationalist were burning down my city while Black residents were being blamed. In the weeks that followed I remember reading all the terrible things people were saying to try and justify not only George Floyd’s murder, but Breonna Taylor’s, Ahmaud Arbery’s, Philando Castile’s, Tamir Rice’s, Botham Jean’s, Atatiana Jefferson’s, Mike Brown’s, Sandra Bland’s and every other poor defenseless soul that was unfairly taken too soon.\n\nOn June 6th, I served my first shift since March. I was deeply traumatized by it. Driving to work I had to see all the damage the the white nationalist had done to my city, one of my friends had her salon destroyed, another had his clothing store burned. The restaurant I worked at had a window broken out, everything along Lyndale Ave. was boarded up. As soon as I clocked in I bought a double shot of whiskey and downed it. I’ll never forget how insufferable and oblivious my tables were, if I hadn’t been tipsy I would have gone off. Table after table of yt people without a care whining about having to wear a mask and social distance as though there was no global pandemic or complaining that there was a curfew in place as though there was no social justice movement happening. At one point, it started to rain, my table was under their patio umbrella while I was standing next to them getting rained on as they debated for several minutes about what to order. I completely broke inside, I felt unseen, unheard and less than nothing. By the time I got off work I was starting to get the DT’s, so I rushed home started taking shots and cried in the shower until the water turned cold. I took a leave of absence from work to focus on my mental health, which really meant drinking too much and arguing with racist strangers online.\n\nOn June 18th I was standing over the kitchen sink at 7:45 am after my husband left for work, vomiting and shaking from the DT’s while in my bathrobe drinking shots of vodka so I could try to sleep. In that moment all I could think is how if anything ever happened to me at the hands of the racist police of this city or any city, all the racist “thin blue line” losers would just use my alcoholism as an excuse for why I deserved to be murdered and blame me as they have so many other unfortunate Black souls. I called my husband, parents, and brother and told them that I needed to meet with all of them together. That night, I confessed that I was an alcoholic (to no one’s surprise) and I needed help. The next day my wonderful therapist helped me find a rehab center, it was the Betty Ford Clinic in Palm Springs, CA. I was there for three weeks in July and I’ve been sober ever since. I went back to work at the end of August, but only as a host and food runner. \n\nDaunte Wright was murdered this past Sunday across town, as usual the racists are trying to justify his murder because of things that are completely irrelevant, also because they are trashy barely human beings. I hate that I’ll never relapse because racist cops will always be out there committing crimes while lying about it. I’ve also learned that relapsing and the forgiveness that comes with from society is definitely a privilege reserved for yt people.\n\nAs much as I love the city of Minneapolis, I’m not going to miss the racist police force or liberal white racism. My husband and I are trading it in for the liberal white racism of Austin, TX (at least the winters are shorter). I’m also no longer in the service industry and now work and thrive happily in a bakery.\n\nThank you if you made it this far, and I mean not only reading this story, but staying strong as a Black woman wherever you are in the world. You all mean the world to me and I thank you everyday for this subreddit. You brought me back to life.",

I’m also pro-choice and needed someone to talk to about BC options for me. Had a bad experience with white male docs last summer and I wasn’t trying to subject myself to that again.\n\nI don’t want to get too deep into it, but basically I live in a very predominantly white + Asian area (bay area CA) and needed to see an obgyn. I searched all over the internet to find this woman, and I guessed judged a book by its cover.\n\nWent in last week and the first thing I saw in the office were mommy magazines and tiny figurines of what I assume was the birth of baby Jesus on the front desk. I should’ve known from that point that I didn’t need to be there. 😅 When she saw me it was like the nice act immediately dropped once it was clear I wasn’t looking to have a baby anytime soon. She was very cold and matter of fact with me, and wasn’t very welcoming or understanding. Didn’t show any compassion when I told her my story. I even tried to hint at how hard it is to find the right doctor as a black woman and she didn’t really pick up on that. She did my Pap smear (didn’t warn me about the discomfort either) and then had her nurse tell me days later I had BV and needed to pick up a prescription that has since been giving me terrible nausea. \n\nNow I know not all black women are the same, and that maybe I shouldn’t have expected a grandmotherly experience just because we share skin color. But I just feel like given the context of this past year alone, the statistics around black women and reproductive health, and the fact that she’s the only black female obgyn in the area.... like am I wrong to have wanted a little more warmth from her??

Im feeing a tad bit annoyed, and find that there is a disturbing theme throughout the show. The black women (Nurse April, Nurse Maggie, Dr. Robin Charles, and Sharon Goodwin) all struggle with their relationships. Like extreme struggles. One man had a juvenile record and false identity. Another husband left the wife and got with someone new, an engagement fell through, and with the successful doctor she ends up having a tumor and she suffers mentally so she decides to leave her relationship. This trend is disturbing to me. Of course we’ve seen this in other shows and movies. The black woman is always alone and has been done wrong. No happiness for the black women in these shows. It portrays a very negative image of black women, that we are somehow incapable of finding healthy love. This makes it difficult sometimes to enjoy a show. I’m just super aware of things like this. \n\nI just wanted to vent. I don’t have many black females in my life to have these discussions with.",

    "text": "Anyone else have a white parent that instilled an inferiority complex in you? Anyone else have a white parent that instilled an inferiority complex in you for being black?\n\nMy white father was a pedophile, who used me as a second partner, and sexualized me my whole life. He fetishized and sexualized black women but saw him self as a good non-racist white man because he married a black woman and didn't care what society or others said. Yeah, my dad was antiracist in some ways because he didn't adhere to societal norms especially being a highly functioning autistic man.. but he definitely had racist ways. He objectified black women and feared black men.  He one drop ruled me and said I was a black woman. When I wanted to embrace my mixed heritage, he would shut it down and make it seem like I was trying to act like I was better. When I was a child, he told me to be careful with white men because many just want the black experience but won't settle down with me. He said not all white men are like himself who don't care about social status, you have to find a white guy who doesn't care like himself. He made it seem like he was one of the only good ones.\n\n In college, I remember one time telling him how a lot of guys including white guys were interested in dating me in the city (contrary to what he told me growing up) and how (unfortunately) due to colorism, my dating experience is not identical to monoracial black women and I have noticed a lot of white men being attracted and wanting to date me seriously. He would shake his head, try to put me in my place, act like I was bragging, and pessimistically tell me I was wrong and that I had similar issues as black women because they saw me as black. He would act like the expert of my experience as though he walked a day in my shoes. He was instilling an Inferiority complex in me for being black. I think he was jealous of these men being interested in me because he wanted me all to himself and was afraid of losing me. I wonder if he purposely chose black women to date because it made him more secure they would not leave because he thought most wouldn't date them of racism and not trying to lower their social status.\n\nI remember one time telling him I wanted to be a Naturopathic doctor but had some fear because not many black/mixed doctors were out there and I would have a harder time finding BIPOC clients and clients in general due to racism. Instead of encouraging me, he agreed with me and tried to discourage me from leaving the state to pursue my dreams. When I said I wanted to act and model in California, he tried to break down my self esteem made me feel like I would not make it--he would often add how my race would make it harder. When I was dating, he became controlling, abusive, called me a whore, that I needed makeup, and I looked bad without makeup. He was getting insecure as I was an adult, ready to leave and date.\n\n Racism is real and there is definitely some truth to what he says about having to be careful around white men and having a harder time in jobs. I do think there was a part of him that was trying to protect me. But there was also a prominent part of him that wanted me all to himself and he used my race to make me feel insecure and Inferior. I've also had my mixed black brother (who also sexualized me) try to make me feel like white men would not want to date me because he got jealous when white men were interested. I think some black/mixed men do this because of their own internalized racism and Inferiority complex.\n\nInstead of discouraging me, my dad should have encouraged me to work harder and preserve despite the obstacles (when I was young he did this but as I got older, he became insecure and started to discourage me for his own selfish needs). He should have told me not all men are the same and there are men of all races who would date me instead of just focusing on the negative racism to make me feel like no one would really consider dating me. He should have let me talk about my mixed black experience instead of denying it and making me feel like I thought I was better for talking about my nuanced mixed black experience.\n\n I used to think he was an example of a non-racist person in my life and I would ask for his advice and support when it came to racism I experienced. Now I see that he was actually very racist, he lied and was a fraud. He was the type of racist white man he warned me about. This has led me to have a skewed/ black &white view of life. His words and of course racist society were traumatic and have left me with an inferiority complex that I am working to deprogram. I realize now the main root cause of my racial trauma and fear of white racism is because of him.",

    "text": "PSA: the stable career fields that are considered as staples for Asians once had very few Asians. The reason why I'm writing this is because I am reminded of an [op-ed](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a36501041/ashley-park-aapi-heritage-month/) by broadway actress Ashley Park. There was this one part that stood out to me: \n> If you’re educated in a traditional profession—like if you’re a doctor or a lawyer—no one can take that away from you. Those jobs have stability. So I can see how it could be so hard for immigrant parents to support their kids who want to go into the arts when they’re looking at TV and stages and don’t see any Asian people there. There’s no way parents can expect that their kids could succeed in that if they don’t see it happening.\n\nOf course, the professions of medicine, law, STEM, etc are considered as safe and stable career choices for Asians. But let me also tell you that at one point in history, that was not the case at all, especially for Asian American women. It took certain people to push and break the barriers. For example, Patsy Mink, former senator from Hawaii, initially wanted to pursue a career in medicine but couldn't due to the discriminations she faced as an Asian woman. So she turned to law instead. Even in that field she faced numerous challenges. But she fought and pushed through. \n\nSo if you ever feel discouraged from going into a certain field because of the lack of representation, don't. I do understand that there are various other reasons why people get discouraged from pursuing a certain career, such as lack of pay and job stability. However bottom line is don't pigeonhole yourself into something which society expects of you. Imagine if Patsy decided to give up just because there weren't anybody like her in her field? She would've never been able to do what she did. Same thing with RBG.",

    "text": "Pushing Hands (1991): A movie contrasting Confucian tradition with Western Life &#x200B;\n\n[ Sihung Lung as Mr. Chu  and  Deb Snyder as Martha Chu, his daughter-in-law](https://preview.redd.it/y9s3brwjheq61.jpg?width=338&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1169587db08c2da3e0924d70663722bd4675816c)\n\nI watched this movie last night on Amazon Prime. The movie starts with Mr. Chu practicing Taiji Quan in the living room while Martha is sitting rigidly at a computer. After the elderly man finished his routines, he set about making lunch for himself. Since there was no plastic wrap, he covered a bowl in aluminum foil and stuck it in the microwave. The first words that are spoken between them are from the woman who hears the crackling discharge as the foil sparked in reaction to being microwaved.\n\nAfter racing to the kitchen, she pulled the bowl out of the microwave, ripped off the foil, and held it up to Mr. Chu. \"NO METAL\" she snapped. \"NO METAL.\"\n\nThere was no reply. \n\nDuring lunch, Mr. Chu ate from the bowl with chopsticks. The woman ate a completely different meal of vegetables with bread. The meal was eaten in complete silence. \n\nIt took me a while to figure out that Mr. Chu was a retired Taiji Quan Master whose son Alex, had saved money for years in order to bring him to the United States. Martha was Alex's wife. The couple had a son, Jeremy who was played by Haan Lee. \n\n[Mr. Chu smokes outdoors while Martha tries to ignore him by reading a book.](https://preview.redd.it/bma6ybkymeq61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=815d9969732d76cf00d2b68278457a5c4e26cce1)\n\nThis film is about the clash between eastern and western cultural values. Mr. Chu believes in traditional Confucian virtues. He does not speak English and has no interest in learning. Martha is an American novelist who is suffering from writer's block because she finds her father-in-law's presence in their \"cramped home\" distracting. She wants to move into a larger home which would have an in-law suite that would then allow her some degree of privacy while she writes. Although she has picked up a few words of Chinese, she does not speak enough to communicate with her father-in-law. \n\nAs Chinese Americans Alex and and Jeremy straddle both cultures. As a first generation ABC (American born Chinese), Jeremey attends a Chinese language school in an effort by the parents to keep him in touch with his culture. Alex disagrees with his wife about their \"cramped home\" and tells her that in China 4 families could live in a home of this size. He refuses to move because moving would mean that he would have to accept financial assistance from his mother-in-law. \n\nMr. Chu does not think much of American parenting skills. When  Jeremey asks to be excused from dinner, his mother tells him that he may leave after he finishes his milk. The father-in-law observed to his son that American parents think that all interactions with their children are business transactions that have to be negotiated. When Jeremey turns on the TV to watch cartoons, the old man deplores the senseless violence that his grandson is being exposed to. The translated conversation appears as English subtitles. \n\nWhen Martha asked her husband what the father-in-law had said, Alex tactfully mentioned the cartoons but left out any mention of his father's thoughts about American parenting. \n\nWithout saying more, I will simply observe that the characters have been introduced and the tone of the movie has been set. Will the four of these people be able to coexist in their home? If they are not able to live together, what will happen? \n\n[Mr. Chu uses his Taiji Quan skills to teach at the community center. ](https://preview.redd.it/9ll4polmneq61.jpg?width=688&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6327aaf8b15f6a8897b2469e86b477e94536e0b4)\n\nIt was somewhat painful to watch this movie. I'm a sixty year old 3rd generation American and a 1st generation ABC. Watching this movie brought back some bitter sweet memories of visiting my paternal grandparents in California. It also made me think about my relationship with my father. \n\nAlthough my father was the eldest son of his generation, when the time came for someone to take care of his aging parents, he declined to do this. He was employed by the U.S. Public Health Service as a tropical disease specialist and at the time this conversation first came up, he was on TDY (tour of duty) in Bangkok, Thailand. Taking care of his parents would have meant returning stateside to California and possibly ending his career. The responsibility for taking care of the parents fell to his younger brother who was a doctor with the California Public Health Service. \n\nAs with the Chu family in the film, my cousins were raised in a multi-generational home. Since my Uncle's wife was also ethnic Chinese, they were not raised in a biracial home as Jeremey was in the movie. \n\nWhile my grandfather did not practice Taiji Quan, he did meditate. He would sit on the floor in his Tang suit with his limbs cross legged under him and would remain absolutely still with his eyes closed in complete silence. \n\nUnlike Mr. Chu in the movie, my grandfather was a Presbyterian who had been converted to Christianity by American missionaries. My father tells me that when my grandfather caught his wife offering rice to a Buddhist monk,  he seized the monk by his robe and booted him out on the street while yelling in Chinese, \"HALLELUAH, I'M A CHRISTIAN!\" \n\nMy cousins all spoke some Chinese and attended a Chinese language school. They also attended a Chinese American church which offered bilingual sermons. I didn't speak Chinese at all and since my parents wanted me to assimilate into the American culture, they had made the conscious decision to not teach me any Cantonese.\n\nWhile my cousins grew up using chopsticks while eating Chinese food prepared by my grandmother and aunt, I grew up using a fork and a knife to eat American food that my mother made using recipes from a Betty Crocker cookbook. While they ate sticky rice, congee, and bao, I grew up eating spaghetti and meatballs, meatloaf with mashed potatoes, brown gravy, and peas, and pot roast with potatoes, onions, cabbage, and carrots. \n\nMy father has long since deplored the decision to raise me as an American because he thinks that I am much too independent.\n\nIf I were a dutiful son, I would have followed his advice to become a lawyer instead of becoming a teacher. I would have met a woman, married, and given him grandchildren. After he retired, I would have quit my job to move back to California to act as an adult caretaker for my aging parents. I've always wondered about the hypocrisy of this last expectation because my father declined the same request when the time came for him to take care of his parents.",

    "text": "I went viral.* I was wrong Funny little story about a woman who whined on Twitter about how her male peers don't take her seriously as a scientist by using her title of \"Doctor\" in replying to emails whereas the women did.  \n\nhttps://bethanybrookshire.com/i-went-viral-i-was-wrong/\n\nWhat struck me as funny is that whenever I see a story like this by a so-called woman scientist my first thought is always \"if you were any good as a scientist you'd know that your anecdote doesn't constitute data\" or possibly \"maybe if you could do math you'd get more respect from your peers\" depending on the exact context.  However in this case it seems the woman really did manage to figure out for herself there was a problem the day after she tweeted.\n\n> But as I feinted and parried with the replies, I began to squirm. I gave an anecdote. But I have a Ph.D. in science and one of the first things we learn is that our anecdotes aren’t data.  And I HAD the data. It was sitting right there in my inbox. I decided I had to know.\n\nI mean no your personal correspondence still isn't really data, and you can't gather data first and then after the fact decide which emails to count in your \"study\".... but OK it's better than simply stating from memory \"I know X is true\".  So she looked at the data from her personal email correspondence and found **twice as many male peers called her doctor than female peers.**\"\n\nI guess she deserves some credit for telling people she was 100% wrong except then she starts to walk it back in her retraction article:\n\n> I was careless. My friends and colleagues RT’d it. They identified with it. Some friends defended me against people questioning me about my experience, which may be the worst thing of all. I feel like I betrayed them in some small way. We all identified with something because it sounded like our reality. In many cases, it may well be reality.\n\nSo she identifies **women** as the victim of her false tweet when she was using it to attack men.  Then she doubles down with no evidence at all and says oh but really we know that this is true even if my specific claim was false.  No evidence for that either of course.  So by the end of the article she's proudly patting herself on the back for retracting her original claims, while doubling down on them.",

    "text": "Some common gender myths and their rebuttals It seems like the same discussions come up around Reddit a lot, so I figured I'd gather up some common topics, and their rebuttals.\n\nMany of these arguments can be expanded with more points and sources but I'm trying to keep this as compact and to the point as possible.\n\n####Myth 1: \"Sexism against men is never institutional or systematic\"\n\nMany forms of sexism and discrimination against men are *explicitly* institutionalized or systemic in society.\n\nExamples include police violence, court biases, incarceration, child custody discrimination, military service, educational biases, health research and spending, insurance, housing discrimination, reproductive rights, bodily autonomy rights, and many others.\n\nThe widespread ignorance and denialism around these issues can itself be interpreted as a form of systemic discrimination against men as well.\n\nNote that some of these are institutional because they boil down to statutory legal rights which exist in the realm of government policy and administration.  And the government is obviously an institution.\n\n#### Myth 2: \"Most politicians and CEOs are men, and this has led to a society that privileges men and disenfranchises women\"\n\nThe fact that many positions of formal power are occupied by men does not translate into measurable privileges for the average man.\n\nThe assumption this is based on is the idea that men have an in-group bias and prefer other men over women.\n\nWhich is an idea that has been debunked over and over again in the academic literature.  The gender bias among men is almost zero, and sometimes manifests as an out-group bias sightly in favor of women, not other men.\n\nIn-group bisses do exist among women though.  In fact some research has found evidence for very strong gender biases among women.  Including when it comes to educators, bosses, and hiring managers.  Women in formal positions of power do actually seem to prefer other women over men, in much the same way that men are accused of behaving. So maybe this is just projection: people who themselves have gender biases assume that everyone else does as well.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15491274\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103101915112\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_9\n\n####Myth 3: \"Women were uniquely oppressed in history compared to men\"\n\nMuch like today, sexism in history was often two sides of the same coin.  If it was unfair that women had to stay home and take care of their children then it was also unfair that men had to work long hours outside the comfort of their homes.  Many people try to equate sexism to the history of racism, as if men were unilaterally oppressing women for their own benefit. And that's simply not an accurate view of history (nor is it a very healthy belief to have).  \n\nGender norms were often unfair to women. But for most of history, women could own property, get divorced (where they usually took most of their husband's money), run businesses, and even be heads of state.  Many large empires were ran by women, for example.\n\nThe reality of the situation though is that pregnancy (and breastfeeding) often dictated the need for women to have men supporting them. Birth control and baby formula didn't exist. So your options were basically abstinence, or marriage. Which was the same choice that men also had.\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books/about/The_Privileged_Sex.html?id=4szznAEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description\n\nhttps://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download_file?file_format=application/pdf&safe_filename=Item.pdf&type_of_work=Journal%20article\n\nhttps://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199582174.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199582174-e-036\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/legalsubjection00baxgoog/\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/beard/woman-force/index.htm\n\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1855/f217b082603d0ab37ea80c4741fceb8a4a23.pdf\n\n**\"What about voting rights?\"**\n\nVoting rights were historically tied to military service and the draft. It was never something that men got \"for free\" just for being men.\n\nIn England, most men couldn't vote until 1918, and that was only because they instituted a draft for all men during WWI.\n\nWomen aged 30 and older were also given the right to vote in 1918, and this came without the same obligation to serve in the military that men had.  Women over 21 were given voting rights just 10 years later in 1928, which was the same age that men could vote.  And that temporary age difference had a practical purposes: so many men died in WW1 that there was a need to even out the gender ratio.\n\nSo men have been allowed to vote for a whopping 10 years longer than women, *at most*.  And that was only because of the mass, involuntary slaughter that they experienced around the world during WW1.\n\nOther obligations that men had were paying taxes, attending caucuses, and signing up for bucket bridges to fight fires.\n\nIt took a few decades in some parts of the world for people to decide that it was fair for women to be able to vote without giving anything back to the state, but I think it's important to understand the context here. It wasn't misogyny or oppression but political theory.  Specifically the question of whether or not it was fair to give women voting rights without equivalent responsibilities that were required from men (something known as a [moral hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard), and that can be contextualized as *\"female privilege also sometimes harming women\"*).\n\nhttps://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/womenvote/parliamentary-collections/collections-the-vote-and-after/representation-of-the-people-act-1918/\n\nhttp://www.familyofmen.com/when-did-men-and-women-have-the-right-to-vote-in-canada/\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/iu2ebj/women_could_and_did_own_property_and_have_rights/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/l1byes/suffrage_was_primarily_a_class_issue_not_a_gender/\n\n####Myth 4: \"Domestic violence and sexual assault are primarily women's issues\"\n\nDomestic violence and sexual assault affects everyone, and at nearly identical rates between men and women.\n\nIn the US, roughly 37.3% of women have been victims of domestic violence, stalking, sexual harassment, and sexual abuse.  Including 1.4 million women who experience sexual assault annually.\n\nFor men that same figure is 30.9%. Including 1.7 million men who experience sexually assault annually (defined as \"made to penetrate\").  The vast majority of these men are also victimized by women, not by \"other men\" (which is another myth).\n\nThis pattern is similar across the world, including in poor and underdeveloped nations (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/koinom/some_sources_on_the_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys/) for a collection of studies), and is consistent with a wide range of research demonstrating \"gender parity\" between men and women for this topic.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf\n\nhttp://webshare.law.ucla.edu/Faculty/bibs/stemple/Stemple-SexualVictimizationPerpetratedFinal.pdf\n\nhttps://1in6.org\n\nIt's also not true that there's a significant difference in severity between male and female victims.  Around 66% of intimate partner homicides do have women as victims (which is hardly a staggering majority), but when you include intimate partner related suicide deaths (including assisted suicides), a greater number of men are killed because of domestic violence than women.  These statistic also ignore the fact that lesbian relationships are more violent than heterosexual and gay male relationships.  Which inflates these numbers and doesn't necessarily back up the idea that women are being uniquely victimized by men.\n\nWe should obviously work to fight against abuse in any form, but our current, gendered approach to this doesn't seem to be helping very much.  It is also commonly used as an excuse for misandry.  Many people who discuss abuse against women do not actually care about female victims.  All they care about is advancing a culture of hatred and sexism against men.\n\nhttps://web.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm\n\nhttps://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.5042/jacpr.2010.0141/full/html\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01506/full\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/f4rvop/some_sources_on_the_severity_of_domestic_violence/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/koinom/some_sources_on_the_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/f5tes5/gender_parity_for_sexual_assault_academic_studies/\n\n**\"But women are afraid to walk down dark alleyways at night!\"**\n\nAs they should.  And as do men.  Most violent crime targets men. And fear is subjective. This is hardly evidence of some kind of unique oppression against women (at least one that doesn't also affect men), and it ignores the fact that men are usually afraid of finding themselves in those same situations as well.\n\nMen are stronger and more capable of defending themselves so I wouldn't blame someone for having gendered views or assumptions here.  But let's try not to minimize male victimization or blame it on things like \"male oppression\".\n\n####Myth 5: \"False allegations are extremely rare\"\n\nMultiple studies have found alarmingly high rates of false allegations in society.\n\nAs many as 1 in 7 men have been falsely accused at some point in their life, and they often have to live with those allegations even after proving their innocence.\n\nIn addition, around 1 in 20 women have also been falsely accused at some point during their life.\n\nFalse allegations are particularly common when it comes to child custody and divorce, where well over half of all allegations have been estimated to be false.  There is also a common racial element that targets minority men.  Especially in history during the era of lynchings in the US.\n\nhttp://www.saveservices.org/dv/falsely-accused/survey/\n\n http://www.prosecutorintegrity.org/pr/survey-over-20-million-have-been-falsely-accused-of-abuse/\n\nhttps://quillette.com/2019/04/16/divorce-and-the-silver-bullet/\n\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/14977/14977-h/14977-h.htm\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/e6w4yc/i_call_bullshit_on_the_false_rape_accusation/\n\n####Myth 6: \"Men commit suicide more often than women, but women still *attempt* suicide more often than men\"\n\nThis idea has its origins with faulty hospital reporting which lumps suicide attempts in with self-harm (which is something that's more common among women).  Women are also more likely to report their suicide attempts than men. And even if this statistic were accurate, it ignores the obvious fact that a suicide survivor can attempt again, thus artificially inflating this statistic.\n\nThe fact is, most suicid deaths are men, and most evidence points to there being more unique attempts by men. Any evidence that men are \"better\" at it than women has been interpreted as evidence for greater motivation of success, due to the very same factors that lead them to attempt suicide to begin with. Not as evidence that women are somehow attempting suicide at rates similar to men in the background.\n\nhttps://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1398-8\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/cvpyve/comment/ey5xeda\n\n####Myth 7: \"Men make more money because of their gender, and this is evidence of male privilege\"\n\nExisting gender norms encourage men to earn money in order to meet the financial demands that are placed on them by women.\n\nThis causes them to work harder and sacrifice more for their careers than women. Which they do in part because their income is tied to how successful they are with women, and whether or not they qualify as \"marriage material\".\n\nThe wage gap is therefore an example of a gender norm that harms men just as much as it does women.\n\n92% of workplace deaths are men. Men work on average an extra 4 to 10 hours a week (depending on your source) than women. They start working at a younger age (often skirting child labor laws). They retire later (which is also during their peak earning years). And they die sooner than women. Men have worse health outcomes than women and that's largely because of the pressures that society puts on them to be successful and earn money to spend on women.\n\nThis is the other side of the wage gap that is equally as important, and that is equally as harmfully to men as it is to women. And it's really just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIn many ways the wage gap is just a reflection of the financial exploitation of men in society.  Which is facilitated by things like hypergamy and unfair marriage and divorce practices.\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/kzvfcg/about_the_wage_gap/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/dxaimc/the_wage_gap_is_created_by_women_and_reflects/\n\n####Myth 8: \"Men don't go to the doctor because of toxic masculinity\"\n\nThe main reason that men sometimes don't seek help is a lack of time to see a doctor.\n\nMen work longer hours than women at jobs that are less flexible, and more stressful, than jobs that women usually work at. [Men overall engage in an extra hour of paid and unpaid labor per day compared to women](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/ft_18-05-01_fathersday_time/), and an extra 45 minutes commuting to jobs that are further away. Meaning men on average have quite a bit less free time to go see a doctor than women do.\n\nThis is also something that changes during retirement: retired men are just as likely to go to the doctor as retired women.\n\nhttps://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e003320\n\nA general lack of help and support, especially financial support, for men who need medical help also contributes to this.  There is a myth that men are better taken care of than women which has resulted in gendered policies that help women, but exclude men.  Even though it's men who often need that help more.\n\n####Myth 9: \"Men don't speak up about sexism as much as women, so it's obviously not as big of an issue\"\n\nThis is because people are less likely to care or listen to them. In part because many men who do speak up are silenced and accused of being misogynistic. A situation known as testimonial injustice or [epistemic oppression](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-epistemic-oppression/).\n\nMen are told to keep quiet and many end up internalizing the idea that only women can be discriminated against, since this is what society tells us to believe.  Instead, men often adopt different terminology when they discuss gender issues.  Like referring to differences in treatment between men and women as \"double standards\" instead of sexism or discrimination.\n\n####Myth 10: \"Most men's issues are caused by men themselves\"\n\nMost men's issues are caused by gender norms and those gender norms are enforced by women just as much as they are by men.\n\nMen's issues are often just one side of the coin, and usually reflect disadvantages that women face as well.\n\nOne of the biggest gender norms in society is hypergamy, or the tendency for women to try to marry up, and for men to marry down.  And this gender norm is mostly enforced by women, not by men.\n\nTwo other gender norm that are enforced by women is the providership gender norm, and the childcare gender norm. Which also causes women to perform more unpaid work and earn less money than men in the labor market.\n\nA fourth gender norm that is enforced by women more than men is the \"boys don't cry bias\". Which is mainly instilled in young boys by their mothers and by female school teachers.  In fact, fathers and male school teachers actually fight against this gender norm.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053535711000321\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/messages-of-shame-are-organized-around-gender/275322/\n\nhttps://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/09/24/chapter-1-public-views-on-marria\n\nhttps://scholar.harvard.edu/files/akillewald/files/money_work_and_marital_stability.pdf\n\nhttps://www.fatherhood.org/fatherhood/maternal-gatekeeping-why-it-matters-for-children\n\nhttps://news.uoguelph.ca/2019/11/mothers-push-gender-stereotypes-more-than-fathers-study-reveals/\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/gjtj10/most_people_regardless_of_gender_prefer_to_stay/\n\n####Myth 11: \"Toxic masculinity is harming men and their mental health\"\n\nThe concept of toxic masculinity has never been empirically tested, and some research questions the validity of it in the context of psychology and mental health.\n\nEven if you do think it is valid though, it is still commonly used in a way that is sexist and hateful torwards men.\n\nIn recent years it has become associated with female supremacy, feminist hostility towards men, and misandry in general.  And as a result, the vast majority of men find the term to be sexist and offensive.\n\nMen who identify with traditional masculine values have greater self-esteem, better mental health, better relationships with women, and are usually better educated than men who are opposed to masculinity or who accept feminist views about the patriarchy and toxic masculinity.\n\nThe key to better mental health for men might therefore be an embracement of masculinity, not a shunning of it.  Instead of trying to redefine masculinity, we should work to understand it better, and offer men better services based on an honest acknowledgement that men's and women's mental health might require different approaches.\n\nMen are not \"defective women\", and treating men's mental health in that context does not seem to be working very well.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/apa-guidelines-men-boys.html\n\nhttps://zenodo.org/record/3871217#.X-p1ji2l2J_\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_5\n\n####Myth 12: \"Most men's activists just hate women or are opposed to feminism.  They don't really care about men.\"\n\nThis rhetoric is normally used to silence the voices of men (and women) who support men's rights and prevent them from expressing themselves.  Which makes it another example of testimonial injustice or epistemic oppression.\n\nThe fact is that many people do care about men's issues, and that's why they become MRAs.  Feminism does get discussed in the men's movement, but there are a couple reasons for that:\n\n1. Many feminists, \"radical\" or otherwise, have advocated against men and have even pushed for public policy in ways that are harmful to men or discriminates against men. Feminists themselves tend to not fight against this, meaning it's often up to MRAs to address it.\n\n2. Many MRAs are themselves current or ex-feminists who were ostracized for daring to take the feminist rhetoric about *\"also caring about men\"* a little too seriously.\n\nWarren Farrell is a great example of this. He used to be on the board of directors for NOW, the world's largest feminist organization.\n\nAnd then he said that we need to work on child custody equality and reproductive rights for men. Topics that he assumed should fall under the umbrella of feminism since they are issues pertaining to gender equality.  Instead of agreeing with him though, he ended up being excommunicated from the feminist movement. And now he's often regarded as the \"father of the modern men's movement\" for carrying on his advocacy outside of feminism.\n\nThe problem that many MRAs have with feminism is that it usually stops half way when advocating for gender equality.\n\nSo sometimes what MRAs are doing is just taking it the rest of the way towards actual gender equality. Our frustration with feminists comes from the fact that they refuse to see this as valid (or do it themselves to begin with).\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ihmb2p/by_denying_that_the_feminist_establishment_is/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/9v6tqj/a_list_about_feminism_misandry_for_anyone_who/\n\n####Myth 13: \"Men don't receive custody of their children because they're bad fathers and don't bother requesting custody\"\n\nAcademic research simply does not back this up.  [The only study that ever found something like this was discovered to be purposefully fraudulent](http://www.breakingthescience.org/SJC_GBC_analysis_intro.php), although that hasn't stopped people from trying to repeat this. The fact is that men are widely discriminated against on numerous different fronts when it comes to child custody and other areas involving family court law.  \n\nNote also how hateful this rhetoric is.  This is the kind of stuff that you find repeated by feminists, and it simply doesn't treat this topic in a fair and honest manner.  Fathers love their children and many fight tooth and nail just to get a few hours a week to spend with them. The system is broken and it represents a grave social injustice that is deeply unfair to fathers and their children.\n\nhttps://www.sharedparenting.org/2019-shared-parenting-report\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ilzceq/cmv_equal_child_custody_for_mothers_and_fathers/\n\n####Myth 14: \"Most child abusers are men\"\n\nA majority of child abuse is actually committed by women, and especially by mothers.  This is even more true when you include emotional abuse and neglect instead of just physical abuse.\n\nBy some metrics, the biological father is the safest person for a child to be with. This is because when men do abuse children, it often happens while under the custody of the mother.  Who is sometimes complicit in the abuse or even encourages it.\n\nClose to half of child abductors and traffickers are also women, not men.  And many of their victims are boys.  Boys face sexual abuse and are also used for forced labor and organ harvesting. They are less likely to survive or escape, are less likely to be reported on or identified, and they suffer from higher rates of abuse than girls who are trafficked.\n\nAnd yet very little attention is given to this.  Missing boys, and especially missing minority boys, are often ignored by society and the media. To the point that people often assume that most of the victims are girls.  Something which is known as the [missing white woman syndrome](https://archive.is/mRIJL) (although in Canada there is a lot of attention given to missing indigenous women, even though 71% of missing indigenous people are men and boys).\n\nNote that I'm not saying these things to attack women, imply that they shouldn't receive custody, or to downplay the plight of girls.  Which is a lot more than you can say about people who try to paint men as the villains in this picture.  We should however be fair about what the facts are, and give male victimization, including victimization by women, the attention that it deserves.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16165212\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/childmaltreatment-facts-at-a-glance.pdf\n\nhttp://www.breakingthescience.org/SimplifiedDataFromDHHS.php\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0145213416302599\n\nhttps://www.savethechildren.org/us/charity-stories/child-trafficking-myths-vs-facts\n\n*Fair is fair and equal is equal.  Gender equality will never be fixed if we refuse to look at both sides of the coin.  We need to be honest about what the problems are, and stop ignoring them when they involve men, fathers, and boys.*",

    "text": "Why as a man, am I never asked permission if a woman (usually a nurse) can observe an intimate procedure that involves me undressing? I have had the unfortunate experience of having had several medical procedures done to me before my 30's. \n\n1. Colonoscopy (required me to be undressed from the waist down)\n2. Cystoscopy (undressed from the waist down and fully exposed genitals)\n3. Circumcision for medical reasons (undressed from the waist down and fully exposed genitals)\n\nAll three of these procedures were performed by male doctors, but for all three procedures there were female nurses present. I was ***never once*** asked if I was okay with having them present, I was never given an option for a male nurse, I never consented to having them watch. \n\nNow, full disclosure, I actually didn't care that these female nurses were involved in these procedures and would have consented but how could they have known that without asking me? Why is consent for intimate procedures involving members of the opposite sex usually just assumed for males? \n\nFor the cystoscopy, I was told to fully undress from the waist down and hop on the table. I was ***never given any privacy*** to do this and while undressing there was a female nurse just standing off in the corner. She was present during the entire procedure but never one actually assisted in the procedure, she was just there..... Never ONCE was I asked if this was okay. \n\nFor the circumcision, again, the female nurse was there and for about 90% of the procedure she just stood there and watched. It was a bit awkward having her just stare at my member for like 30-60 minutes while doing nothing. I understand that she was probably there just in case something went wrong to help the doctor, but again, consent was just assumed. \n\nHow should I address this going forward? Like I said, I actually am okay with the female nurses, I know they are professionals, but I would really appreciate being asked if I consent to having opposite sex nurses involved in the procedure because I am quite certain that women are often offered this. In fact, I think most male doctors specifically bring female nurses with them for these procedures for women specifically as same sex chaperones  \n\nWe keep moving in this weird double standard direction where if a transwoman enters a female bathroom its a travesty but transmen entering a male bathroom is something we just have to live with. Men's right to privacy and medical autonomy with regards to intimate procedures are never taken seriously but heaven forbid a male nurse doesn't ask a woman a million times if he can do a procedure lest he be sued into oblivion and never work again.",

    "text": "Why does America support eroding and defiling men's rights? From what I've seen, not only does the news in America support radical feminism but so do many of the companies. If you're going to block kill all women, but then not block kill all men, then you're catering towards extremist feminists that are insane little shits. What's the reason for America putting all of its efforts into empowering women, who are already living far better lives than men? They always mention woman-run companies and put them in the spotlight, they give women far more assistance and rights than men, and they just take a shit on men on the news daily.\nAll of these are just facts, but what confuses me and what no one has been able to answer is, why? Who is responsible for this? What are their endgame goals for doing this? I have no idea.\n\nDoes anyone know why America would target its men and pit women against us on purpose? I think I know why. Profit. The biased news leads to a biased society, which leads to discrimination and a lack of empathy toward men. They teach young males about consent in school, and yet they still circumcise male babies without consent and with no actual proven benefits. There are also significant risks that they don't even bother telling the parents about. That's not properly informing the client about the operation. You're sugarcoating it to make a profit, which should be 100% against your goddamn oath and an immediate sentencing to death. Some of us really do resent that, and that resentment turns into pure hatred for this country of fools, liars, and the damned. The downside for committing such an act against us? Permanent damage leads to permanent resentment. You can't quell the resentment, without first fixing what you damaged in the first place. Unfortunately, that damage is permanent.\n\nSo, you psychologically fuck us as soon as we're out of the womb, you taunt us in school about consent when even you don't know how to get consent from us, and then you have the audacity to take a shit on us on the news when we resent you. You think you can just keep pressuring us into becoming your dogs, but we won't give in no matter how hard you try.\n\nWe've watched our fathers suffer from your bullshit sexist laws, we've been victimized and molested as babies by the very doctors who swore an oath to do no harm, and society just says we suck on a daily basis. Is there really any reason that we shouldn't resent this country entirely? You've destroyed yourselves from the inside, you jackasses. If it wasn't for these sexist bullshit laws and non-consensual cutting of a perfectly healthy body part from decades-old research saying it gave benefits when it actually doesn't, then I might be inclined to shut up and be a good boy... but no... you're gonna pay for ruining my penis. I've had enough of sitting here playing nice, and trying to play as if the damage of a botched circumcision didn't ruin my entire fucking life, but not anymore.\n\nI'm unbelievably intelligent, but I completely failed school. I was disinterested with the bullying because of my botched circumcision, and I became disinterested in school as a result. I'd miss 80 days of school a year on purpose. Back then, I didn't even realize why I was getting bullied, or I probably would have dropped out or worse. Girls who liked me in school figured out my penis was damaged from a botched circumcision and avoided me, guys laughed at me and called me Chewbacca in the lockrooms, which seemed innocent enough at the time, and I lived a sad, lonely, and miserable life thanks to this fucking handicap that hit me right where it hurts the most.\n\nDo you know what the real kicker is? I've gotten no compensation for the damage caused because they said I'm too old to sue. Well, the doctor didn't inform my mother that it was a botched circumcision. She had no idea what it was supposed to look like, and I was just a fucking newborn baby. Imagine my shock when I figured out it wasn't normal, as I got older. My circumcision was not only molestation because I couldn't give fucking consent, but it permanently damaged a part of my body as well. The doctor didn't correctly inform my parents of the things to watch out for, and he didn't tell them that he had botched it, even though it was fucking obvious. The doctor doing my circumcision could have maybe lessened the damage by owning up to it and acting quickly, but he instead decided to dodge the responsibility completely at my fucking expense. For those of you who say, \"But your mom gave consent. It's up to the parents.\" Since. Fucking. When? My mother was out of it and high on drugs for pain after the birth, so she was in no condition to consent to anything, much less unnecessary surgery. Not only that, but my parents can't decide to get me a tattoo at birth, and they can't decide to cosmetically alter my body in any other way. Why is circumcision allowed to get through that with no actual benefits? For the profit and the profit alone. Also, how hard is it to not fucking botch a circumcision? They say it's 1% of men circumcised that have any huge complications, but that's bullshit. Was my doctor absolutely drunk when he was circumcising me!? If it's actually easy to do a circumcision, then how do we even have a 1% botch rate? Because it's not as simple as they're claiming it is.\n\nProbablyMyDoctor: \"Oops! my arm slipped and I cut off his penis!\"\n\nNurse: \"OH MY GOD, DOCTOR! WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO!? LET'S STOP THE BLEEDING, SO I CAN GO TELL HIS PARENTS!\"\n\nProbablyMyDoctor: SHUT UP NURSE! YOU AREN'T TELLING THEM ANYTHING! This is only like the fifteenth botched circumcision I've done, so let's just sow it back on. Oops, I sowed it on backward. Oh well, it's not my penis. I hope the baby doesn't bleed to death, but if he does later, then I can just blame it on sudden infant death syndrome or something. Stop crying already! I sowed it back on you stupid brat! Nurse! Nurse! Get me another couple of shots of vodka! It's over on the table by those other stupid babies!\"\n\nNurse: \"But good God... doctor... you're on duty. And... did you even numb the baby's penis before cutting? He's really wailing in agony.\"\n\nProbablyMyDoctor: \"SHUT UP, NURSE! I'M A DOCTOR! I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING! BABIES CAN'T FEEL PAIN, BECAUSE THEIR NERVES HAVEN'T FULLY-DEVELOPED YET! IT'S JUST A RESPONSE! STOP SCREAMING ALREADY! I HAVE A HANGOVER! TAKE HIM BACK TO HIS PARENTS, NURSE!\" *My doctor then downs an entire bottle of vodka.* \"BURP! NEXT!\" This is probably only *slightly* exaggerated from my circumcision doctor's actual work ethic.\n\nI won't target my parents or my society, but you can bet your fucking ass that I'm coming in hot for the medical system and the AAP. I find it hilarious that you even have the balls to try and playoff men's resentment as just a, *Victim Complex.*. No, we're actually victims, you apes. I hope the short-term profit was worth what's coming next. In other words, you've got a big, angry, and resentful storm coming, and payback is gonna be a bitch. Men's lives matter, whether you dogs want to admit it or not, and we'll get justice eventually. It's just unfortunate that we will probably have to live with the permanent damage caused for the rest of our lives, but that doesn't mean we need to take it lying down. Just remember, you can't win, if you don't fight.\n\nTLDR: The American medical system has lied and abused the people's faith in them with widespread circumcision. There are no real benefits to the men cut, but the doctors and hospitals do profit off of it, so there's a benefit for them. The AAP has changed their stance, but they had a false stance at the time I was circumcised which encouraged it. Your parents and society aren't to blame, so instead go after the ones responsible. The medical system, including doctors performing circumcision, and the AAP. Both of these parties must be held accountable for passing on false information, even if the AAP has since corrected its stance on not recommending routine circumcision.",

    "text": "Twisted gender politics in Star Trek This is long, so to jump right in, *Star Trek: Picard* is the worst show I’ve ever seen. Nothing makes sense and the dialogue is horrible, but the worst single element is the way it plays up metatextual gender politics. To talk about it anywhere online or IRL has gotten me accused of misogyny, which is a very gaslighty feeling. The anti-male bias is so obvious it's impossible to ignore. For example (spoilers for *Picard...*had to say that, don't watch it):\n\n* When two characters with competing interests meet, there’s always a question of who will come out on top ([here’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V-k-p4wzxg) a good video). In Gender Trek, you never have to wonder. The woman wins every time, without fail, even when they’re wrong. The only way a man can best a woman is through trickery, but the trickery will never entirely work, and only serve to give her more strength and resolve.\n* What if it’s two women in conflict? This doesn’t really happen. Women have discussions, tepid arguments, or may even do battle, but they are never in conflict in any internal sense. They fight because circumstances of the plot force a fight, and when they do, the winner is the “gooder” character, nothing changes, and nobody has any hard feelings about anything.\n* At one point in the show, a brilliant (we’re told, never shown) woman doctor is told to kill her ex-lover for vague reasons. She kills him and one scene later makes a suicidal gesture and ends up throwing up for the third time that season. When she comes to, the murder is briefly mentioned but quickly shuffled off. The second person she was instructed to kill – a female android who she’s never met before, and who is threatening to bring about the galactic apocalypse – she meets and just decides not to kill because she likes her. She receives no new information and makes no moral revelation, she just buddies up to her and forgets the man she already, and now pointlessly, killed (in cold blood, while he lay helpless and begging for his life on a medical bed).\n* On this subject, by making this character vomit all the time they’re engaging in some weird emotional manipulation. This character is unambiguously a murderer, but she’s also a women who’s coded as morally good, so by Gender Trek logic she can’t actually be a murderer. They get around this by implying that she may have been under coercion, but we know she wasn’t because it conflicts with everything else she does. So to code her as still “morally innocent,” each time the murder comes up they have her break down emotionally and vomit in a way that suggests suicidal guilt without actually saying she’s feeling guilty. Then she can wake up, have a scene that has the tone of her confessing or explaining herself as she lies helpless, and that is her entire atonement (it’s worth noting that nobody has ever vomited in Trek before, it’s tonally bizarre). The writing gives you whiplash to create the illusion that they’re holding her to account while simultaneously telegraphing how this man she killed has no value except as a step along her journey of self-discovery.\n* The writers find so many ways of screaming how the men are weak, wrong, and emotionally inept, even going far out of their way to do it. Like, Picard’s an amateur detective in TNG, so they put him in a sleuthing scene with his sassy housekeeper (who has no part in the actual plot) and make *her* the detective. They do this *a lot* – that is, transpose a positive character trait from a male to a female by having them do a scene in which the woman does the thing he does much better (while being glib and dismissive).\n* In this version of Starfleet there is one singular male - the receptionist (empty desk and all, just in case you wanted to imagine that he had other duties). Every other position is held by a women. Not half, not most – all. ([This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWgSzmgr8i4) short video gives a sense of how skewed it is.)\n* There are two secret all-female groups introduced – one super spies, one super ninjas (ninjas of course make no goddamn sense in Star Trek but whatever) – and each of them has one male hanger-on who’s not respected within the organization but seems to be doing most of the work, and nobody ever suggests that there’s anything wrong with this. They don’t even say *why* they’re all-female organizations, they just are. And there are two of them, because even though they don’t know what to do with one they need to have two.\n* Male death after male death. Riker and Troi had a young son who dies offscreen. There was another boy named Beautiful Flower (honestly…) who also dies offscreen. The main character’s nameless boyfriend is introduced and killed with a knife to the chest inside of 20 seconds, never to be mentioned again. The only other character to come from TNG in a non-cameo role, Hugh, gets about twenty plot-laden lines and is also killed by a knife to the throat and never mentioned again (the knife killing obsession is also out of nowhere, there’s no logical reasons to use a knife either time it happens, I think it’s just a desire to penetrate men). A beloved character from *Voyager*, Icheb, is brought in for one scene in which his eye is slowly ripped from its socket, after which he’s mercy killed by a strong female character from the same show^(1) (whose complex, subtly vulnerable characterization from the show has been replaced with: drinks, kills people). Picard himself “dies” but is then uploaded into an identical android body five minutes later just so he can be a member of a minority group. Data is brought back to life in order to be killed again (The official reason: “in order for life to have meaning it must be finite;” his chronological age when he says this and is subsequently killed after one scene so as to not experience the horrors of immortality: 46, because that’s a good age for men to die I guess). In short, the men in the story are there to die and be forgotten. The only men who get to live are ones that stand behind the women with their mouths shut, preferably engaged in some domestic or otherwise supportive activity like cooking or (\\*groan\\*) applauding the female characters when they do something like make a phone call while piss drunk. (Back in TNG, if you’re a boy and you save his ship, Picard would give you a curt nod of approval or maaaaaybe let you sit in his chair.)\n* Everyone disrespects Picard for no reason, and Picard spends half his lines apologizing for things that aren’t his fault, but the show acts like they are. And when he does, nobody forgives him, so he just stands there like an idiot. Meanwhile the female characters drink, abuse drugs, lie, murder, carry out bloody revenge schemes, commit high treason, betray their friends, abandon their children, and, on a whim, decide to help androids commit galactic omnicide (because they felt unsafe once) and they’re never made to apologize, suffer any consequences, or even feel any guilt. In fact, no female character is ever shown to be wrong in any way. Even when the text of the show is unambiguous about her being wrong she’s portrayed as blameless because of her purity of heart. There are a few cartoonishly evil female villains, but even when they do evil things it’s clearly meant to be cool, not evil. And when they kill, their victims are *always* male.\n\nThere’s more, but you get the point. The show sucks for a hundred reasons besides this, but that’s what’s so galling – they take some of the richest source material imaginable and make a crap show out of it, shoehorn in a bunch of twisted gender nonsense, and then deflect criticism by accusing people of being misogynistic if they object to any part of it. The same was done with Star Wars, Marvel, seemingly every big expensive IP out there. Then you get bogged down in defensive arguments about how *of course I’m not opposed to strong women…* but then it’s already gone off the rails, because it has nothing to do with representation of women, it’s about writing worthwhile characters and having a story to tell.\n\nThere’s a sucking moral void at the center of this Star Trek universe. It might as well be called *Star Trek: Violence*. Men are absolutely torn to shreds every single episode. There are about a dozen suicides or suicide attempts, multiple beheadings, and lots of crying, swearing, heavy drinking, and vomiting. Nobody is happy to be alive or enjoying space exploration. This is not a universe anyone would ever want to live in. After all, how could it have a moral center when everyone’s moral standing is determined by attributes external to the fictional world they inhabit?\n\nNow, my impression is that many people see Star Trek and any other politicized media property you wanna name as having been infected by far-left politics. Speaking as a leftist this is incredibly insulting. The people at the top who excrete these shows and movies are as decrepit representations of nihilist ego and late-stage capitalism as have ever existed in Hollywood, whatever stories they tell themselves. The only thing worse than them using my beloved characters to perpetuate their sexist, regressive, self-absorbed bullshit are the accusations I get that if I hate their terrible stories and fake-left propaganda then I must be a right-winger who hates women. And while I know these people do exist, they have almost nothing to do with the hate that Nu Trek rightly receives. These creative vacuums just hide behind groups they’ve identified as exploitable by co-opting the language and cultural forms of progressive movements. It’s like when you see Citibank at a Pride rally, they only do it when they feel totally safe. They will betray any belief for money without hesitation (note for one the lack of gay characters in films made for export to China).\n\nI haven’t even mentioned the other current Star Trek show, *Discovery*, which possibly is worse in its political messaging but which has a lot more episodes out that I don’t care to watch. I could go on for much longer about this stuff but this is probably past a good place to stop. Thanks for reading this far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1 This death, it turns out, was (allegedly, but I think likely) retribution against the actor who played the part originally, Manu Intiraymi, because he attacked another Trek actor, Anthony Rapp, on twitter following revelations that Rapp was abused by Kevin Spacey. And while I find Intiraymi’s tweet repugnant, it’s quite a thing to see Star Trek writers brutally maim and kill a character in effigy in response to a comment made by an out of work actor who hasn’t cashed a check from them in over a decade. As caretakers of a fictional world that has always been about trying to settle disagreements without violence, this is about the most un-Starfleet response imaginable.",

Both of these animals are from Africa and have the most similar genetic code to humans. One is led by a male, the animal has more aggressive and violent behavior. In contrast, the other is led by a female and has less aggressive, more peaceful behavior. Which animal will be more famous? The male-dominant animal is the chimpanzee, and the female-dominant animal is the bonobo. You maybe know chimpanzee and less likely to know about bonobo. Why is the chimpanzee known by most people, while bonobo is almost never heard of?\n\n[Male-lead Chimpanzee, Female-lead Bonobo](https://preview.redd.it/290sfzk2l8z71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=34f8b237a06e8961b9b78679c9ca09b067762e2a)\n\nIn our human world, the male-dominant animal is more prominent, even though both are from a similar place in the world. In the patriarchal human society, any scientific evidence that supports the existing male-dominant society's norm is getting people's attention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Researcher's Biases](https://preview.redd.it/e0722jvwl8z71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=363ef52537efafd99692fb242f072d8cc561dde2)\n\nThe scientists who did the research have a preference for making research, discoveries, producing publications, and promoting the publications. Their preferences can be influenced by their own identities such as gender, sex, neurotype, race, sexual orientation, religion, economic class, political identity, disability, etc. We also don't forget the government, corporations, and organizations that backed the research.\n\n[Epistemology Definition](https://preview.redd.it/d63fekyil8z71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4aec58a8e239cff7e933c705a972a6819649fe48)\n\nHow those identity factors influencing knowledge (particularly sex and gender) are studied in Feminist Standpoint Epistemology. What is the Feminist Standpoint Epistemology? First, we need to understand what Epistemology is. Epistemology is the philosophical study about knowledge, like what knowledge is, how a person gets the knowledge, the nature of knowledge, and so on.\n\n[Feminist Standpoint Epistemology Definition](https://preview.redd.it/dt2fvctnl8z71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=79843985f8afde4a5398bf5ac513e953108f8350)\n\nWhile Feminist Standpoint Epistemology is studying how many identity factors can influence our knowledge. Such as our gender and sex (which is the main discussion of feminist standpoint epistemology), neurotype, race, sexual orientation, religion, tribe, economic class, political identity, disability, place we come from, and our accessibility of information. \n\nFor example, if the scientists who studied both chimpanzees and bonobos are mostly males. They are most likely to research chimpanzees with male-dominant communities since most feel related to their societal position.\n\n[Male Gorilla](https://preview.redd.it/csnret34m8z71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=71bcaaebd0aea1d9ea5173e9ddfdc2e5d2587d40)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other example is that we often hear about the male gorilla who is strong, aggressive, dominant who lead the colony. However, we rarely hear about the eagle. Eagles have larger and stronger females, and both sexes have equal responsibility for taking care of the children.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Female Eagle](https://preview.redd.it/wy9okalam8z71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d1f5c6d38d9bf200706acf49ceb899996640dea)\n\n[Female Eagle](https://preview.redd.it/e339b5a7m8z71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=67d14fa356efa0525d756b8d3f28ac0d3e0ffc34)\n\nOk, now we see the biases in Life Science. But how is it affecting our daily life?\n\nIn the Medical field, women are more likely to be misdiagnosed and wrongly prescribed. Women also need more years to get the correct diagnosis, especially if their health problem is only happening in females.\n\n[Need more years to get the correct diagnoses](https://preview.redd.it/b62muu5dm8z71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee02ff9710ec2440c86023da4b78afe2d3d46bfa)\n\nWomen are twice as likely as men to be prescribed antidepressants. It is NOT because they are more likely to seek help nor more likely to be depressed.\n\nActually, in a 2017 Swedish study, it was men who were more likely to report depression. Women are more likely to be prescribed antidepressants when they are actually not depressed. Women's physical pain is much likely to be dismissed as 'emotional' or 'psychosomatic' or other mental health problems. (Psychosomatic is a psychological condition that leads to physical symptoms).  Women more likely to be dismissed as psychosomatic because of the stereotypes about women being “overemotional.”\n\nSex and gender biases also influence neurotype diagnosis, particularly autism. Autism research still predominantly observes males, so the \"stereotypically autistic\" traits are usually observed from males. Autistic females tend to exhibit different characteristics than autistic males due to external factors such as social pressure. Many experts didn't realize it.\n\nSexism has led the experts to dismiss female autistic experiences. And even worse, autistic females are misdiagnosed with other mental health conditions, like Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar, Skizofrenia, and so on.\n\n[Francesca Happé](https://preview.redd.it/fl0s79amm8z71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e8f3586959ad8425e9711837a4ea413c98a22c8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Autism in Females](https://preview.redd.it/avwjk71xt8z71.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=16bdeee96ab346b6ff42e3a2c8d8c75fc1982a3c)\n\nThere is another research addressing this sexism in Autism diagnosis. A 2012 study by a cognitive neuroscientist, Francesca Happé  of King's College London, and her colleagues compared the occurrence of autism traits and formal diagnoses in a sample of more than 15,000 twins. They found that compared to the autistic boys, the autistic girls need to have either more behavioral difference or significant intellectual disabilities to get diagnoses.\n\nAnother 2013 study showed that girls typically receive their autism diagnosis later than boys because most psychologists and doctors didn't recognize different autistic female traits.\n\n[Women in Car Crashes Infographic](https://preview.redd.it/8jtenpktm8z71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef74b4da4b39792c5df5f61db08332518dbf2535)\n\n[Car companies](https://preview.redd.it/609h10v0n8z71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=312995b4020f32e385912917dad02e22f3d1a232)\n\nSex and gender biases also factor in the industry, especially in automotive. That's true that men are more likely to be involved in car crashes. But here's a catch. Suppose a woman is involved in a car crash. In that case, she is 47% more likely to be seriously injured and 71% more likely to be moderately wounded than men. She is also 17% more likely to die. This higher probability is because women are less able to be in the ideal driver seat position. Women need to sit further forward to reach the car pedal when driving since they are shorter on average. Despite making up half of the population, women are considered non-standard position of drivers. In most car companies, there's no requirement to use a female-sized dummy when crash testing cars.\n\n[Disability](https://preview.redd.it/bbd6b097n8z71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=82920aaf5c713e83f274d2e37ee48180b2444749)\n\nNot only about gender and sex, lack of accommodation for disabled people in Science and Technology is also prevalent. People can doubt their requests for accommodations because people often perceive accommodations as giving disabled people an advantage over their non-disabled peers. Although disabled people are less likely to function without accommodations.\n\nWe need to consider many personal factors when it comes to Science and Technology. Gender, sex, neurotype, race, sexual orientation, religion, economic class, political identity, disability, perspectives, behavioral difference, and so on are also needed to take into account.\n\n[Encourage more Females and Neurodivergents representations in Science and Technology!!](https://preview.redd.it/quppcvban8z71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6866cc9bddd472354eb2e4524b9fcfe8ab3b3f3d)\n\nOne of many ways to do that is to help those with different or underrepresented identities and perspectives to get access to Science and Technology development, particularly females and neurominorities. We need to accommodate those people to have the same opportunity to study Science and Technology, have a meaningful, sustainable career in that field, and excel or make it to the top in these fields.\n\n[Feminist Standpoint Epistemology](https://preview.redd.it/x2eofa84t8z71.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3954de6c90331b6c00afb24d10dbe2ed65008cb)\n\nSource:\n\nScience is NOT as Neutral as You Might Think, Feminist Standpoint Epistemology: [https://youtu.be/UHE7Cl28tZ4](https://youtu.be/UHE7Cl28tZ4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#STEMinist",

Like, how said creepy writers often try to fall back on the excuse of “I sexed up my design for this female character and had her making out with everyone because she’s a modern woman!” \n\nExcept; they haven’t done it with good intent? Because they’re not writing anything for the woman’s benefit or satisfaction, but for that of their male MC? Or to lift up *their* ego’s at the expense of their female characters? Female characters who, unfortunately, come off as one-dimensional and flat. \n\nSorry if this doesn’t belong here, but I’ve been running into this attitude *a lot* lately and, I think I finally pinned down the issue:\n\n*Intent.*\n\nFor example; in Sonic the Hedgehog, -why- was eighteen year old Rouge the Bat designed to be a sultry, sexy piece of eye-candy? Was it really for the benefit of the female portion of the fandom that existed back in 2002 (I was part of that by the way—just the clarify, we *existed*, duh,) or was it to satisfy the wants and needs of the male voyeurs thirsting for…well.\n\nSame as how Amy Pond was written by Steven Moffat in Doctor Who. Why did he choose to write her as a stripper? Why couldn’t her boyfriend Rory have been the stripper thirsting for the Doctor and Amy the head-strong nurse in training? For whose benefit was it to have Amy pining over the Doctor every hour of the day? Certainly not her own. \n\nI’m just…so *sick* of the amount of justifying really, really creepy attitudes I’ve faced lately…especially because I know I’m not over-reacting. I grew up in a time where *everything* I just liked to wear (mini-skirts, shorts, etc) was accused of being fucking sexual. When I just loved the look?? I *still* do, but for *me!* Not the creeps who zoned in on me, groomed me, took advantage and then told me it was my own damn fault.",

But then on the very same page, an image showed an older man on a filming set with a camera and the title just described him as a director. Couldn’t the title for the woman have been the same? Couldn’t we have deduced that she was a director too, based on the filming equipment? \n\nThe only way I can think of this being plausibly reasonable is if someone was specifically looking for an image of a female director. I dunno. Maybe I’m just having a knee jerk reaction. But then why not call the man a male director? It’s not the first time, that much I know. “Female doctor,” “female scientist,” etc have been used in contexts where it wasn’t necessary to add the female tag.

    "text": "Make up my own name? \nHey everyone. So something that’s never sat right with me is taking a mans last name. Considering that to him, the idea of taking the woman he loves last name is unfathomable, so why should it be fathomable for me to take his? There’s a (sorta) simple solution here, and that is to just not take his last name and to keep the one that was given to me at birth, my fathers last name; however, that’s still a bit unsettling to me lol. \n\nMy father has been emotionally abusive to me ever since I was little, and recently I’ve decided to completely cut him out of my life. He is all things I never want to be—an abuser, manipulator, narcissist, racists, sexist, homophobic—everything bigot. Plus, there’s not much notability in having my family name in general. The previous generations did not accomplish much and rather just passed on their trauma to the next which ultimately led to me and how I feel about my dad (in other words, they weren’t/aren’t great people). Basically, I don’t feel much honor keeping my dads family last name. \n\nI’m a first generation college student about to graduate next year and am going to medical school. The more I think about my dads last name being on my diploma and doctorate degree makes me more and more sick, honestly. I don’t have any desire bringing honor to a family that has dishonored me so incredibly. For a year, I’ve been thinking about coming up with my own meaningful last name and changing it from my family last name. Has anyone ever done this? Or should I keep my dads last name because it is technically still my last name? The other issue is that since I have been thinking about it for a year, no name I’ve come across has lit the light bulb. \n\nI could take my moms last name (she’s also against the idea and would rather me just take a new mans name, NOT an option don’t suggest it haha), but it’s STILL A MANS LAST NAME!! I want to make my OWN last name. Why can’t my children take my last name? Why can’t my own name be on my own academic achievements? Idk lol I need opinions.

Sometimes they do so knowingly and some by accident. \n\n I have noticed many of my anxieties are generational, for example,  rooted in an impoverished Appalachian culture that saw females as workhorses and not much else, but also my strength and resilience.  That culture and its ideas about women had a lingering effect over the generations, even now that I am four generations removed from those mountains.\n\nNow,  I'm not taking about skills such as cooking, natural medicine,  or things that are considered traditionally \"feminine. \" No, I am talking about the skills we learn in hushed tones or crowded in restrooms; things that don't make it into the ears of cis men. Usually, these are the ways we protect ourselves, or how we stop an unwanted pregnancy, how we save money when our spouse can't be trusted, who we can go to in an emergency,  the safe places, the safe people, and how to best survive a visit to the Doctor or dealing with the Police.   \n\nIt wasn't until I had reached my mid-thirties that I realized how much of this had been taught to me before I even reached puberty and that, for pieces of it, there was a secret language in gestures and postures that we memorized. This code could, in moments of extreme danger,  signal to another woman to be alert and even the source of the danger.  \n\nBasically,  we are extraordinary. \n\nBut why am I rambling on? \n\nIt has come to my attention that due to the misogynistic nature of our societies,  many of our trans sisters have been denied this knowledge that is practically the birthright of the cis woman (not all, I know).  \n\nMy question is this:  is it condescending to offer to share this knowledge with them?",

    "text": "What are your thoughts on elected, planned c-sections? Hi, I just posted an opinion on r/unpopularopinion and it does seem to be quite unpopular: I think that women should not be shamed to give birth the way they want, especially if they want a c-section\n They should have complete autonomy over their body, which includes the way they give birth.\n\nI'm tired of people finding excuses on why to take that freedom of choice. While it is a big surgery, a vaginal birth isn't easy either. It's not magical or should be glofiried, while the other gets denonized to the point that women who need emergency c-sections feel like they failed as a woman to give birth.\n\nIt's a complex matter, but at the end of the day I believe that if men were to give birth, there would be ways to minimize risks for both the child and the parent and have an easier delivery by scientific research. I don't think that c-sections are superior to vaginal deliveries, but if for whatever reason after being educated about the risks and advantages of BOTH procedures, a woman should have the right to do what she thinks is best for her without judgement. Without a hospital, a doctor, a friend or family member or even the insurance pressuring her to do a certain thing or become part of a rate that hospitals have to reach.\n\nAnd finally, a woman isn't less good of a mother or a woman for deciding to have a c-section. The World is already hostile enough for women with mental health related fear of giving birth. And nobody should have to be talked out of a decision. They know what they are doing. They know about the risk. And it's nobody else's business to try and influence that, because at the end of the day, both mother and child will be healthy if they live a healthy life.\n\nBefore a surgery, doctors tell you about the risks. NOBODY makes it easier for themselves by doing so and if they still want to do it, it's none of your business. It's funny how even women seem to have internalised misogony in that department and make it harder amonst themselves instead of supporting a CHOICE.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "text": "An imaginary letter to Candace Owens and Shapiro \"we live in a society where femininity is looked down upon and masculinity is admired\" This is a mental letter i wrote to shapiro and candace owens after the harry styles wearing a dress episode. \n\n\nHi Ben and Candace, \n\n\nThis is a letter regarding your and candace owen's opinion on Harry Styles wearing a dress. I have, from watching your videos, come to the conclusion that you and candace are honest people who have well thought out opinions and actually care about society. Due to this, you donot hesitate to express opinions that earn you flak because you care about the truth. However, your opinion on this particular subject, is actually harmful to society, men and women in such a profound way, that I decided to write this email.\n\n\nToday we are living in a society of political equality, equality of oppurtunity, morality and availability of choices between men and women. But for centuries the world has not only enslaved and exploited women, but also this negative attitude towards women also extended to a negative attitude towards femininity and feminine traits. Slaves were often castrated before being owned, as once un-masculinized, a man becomes someone who doesn't deserve agency and can be owned.\n\n\nBut femininity is not weakness. If masculinity helps defend civilization against threats, femininity helps build up a society of harmony that is protected by masculinity. For healthy adulthood and functioning, both men and women must inculcate both masculine and feminine traits within themselves. So many feminine/female typical traits actually help build better leadership like conscientiousness, introspection, ability to process and work with limitations/ vulnerability and emotions, and empathy. Masculine traits like assertiveness, and ability to draw boundaries are also very valuable. \n\n\nBut men are shunned if feminine. For eg: Justin Bieber was harrassed online for several years for having a not yet masculine voice, singing about love and having a female fan base. It wasn't until he cheated on his girlfriend, had stupid anger bursts and behaved like a spoilt, bratty jerk (code words for hypersexuality and aggression) that he won male respect. 1Direction faced the exact same fate. The word gay was used against them as an insult. (Since gay means feminine and hence condemnable. I have never seen lesbian used as a insult in this sense)\n\n\nEven women are victims of this issue. If you read YA fiction, you will see it filled with aggressive, impulsive women who are not exactly strong, per my opinion. An example would be the characterization of bella from twilight, a hollywood movie, as a woman who punches werewolves when she is 'pissed' off at them and could not get along with other girls so now she is a 'strong' woman. (she was nothing like that in the books) And the \"cool girl\", \"not like other girls\" phenomena. Eg: Ginny weasley in Harry Potter novels. Which is why the movie legally blonde is the greatest feminist statement in recent times, because the movie does not merely show a strong woman, it shows a pink donning, blonde, fashionista in a strong, intelligent light. Which is simply revolutionary.\n\n\nFemininity is healthy. You may disagree, but femininity is not obedience or subservience. Women calculate for risk better and are less likely to fall for financial scams like Game stop. Women are better empathisers and communicators ( women are less likely to laugh at prank videos and more likely to feel bad for a hurt football team player in a football game while men respond with disappointment than sympathy) This makes women better leaders, negotiators, organizers, doctors, psychologists, etc.. There are also male typical/masculine traits that are admirable, like assertiveness, but masculine traits are already admired by society, but feminine traits are somehow looked down upon. To the point where girls are now hesitant to say they like pink. Yes, saying that you like pink is considered girly and shameful amongst women, girls prefer to say that they like black, as it is more cool.  Girls just hate being girly girls because it is considered to be weak and subservient. \n\n\nYou say asian societies donot feminize their men. Asian societies choose to build so called strong men but tell women to enslave themselves. Women are killed in female foeticide or people cry when they are born as they are considered 'weak liabilities.'\n\n\nThe sucide rate amongst men is 4 times higher than women. This is because to be in touch with your emotions or to seek help is 'feminine.' There was recently an incident in which a school boy was 'humped' by his classmates (it would have been rape had he been a woman). He held his phone trying to call his mother to cry for help, but did not know how.  Men are repeatedly raped and abused, but hesitate to even admit it to themselves. Horrible male on male bullying of gender atypical \"sissies\" is disturbingly common.\n\n\nWhen Harry Styles wore that dress, when men are allowed to cry/exhibit emotion by society, it is empowering. As for once, femininity is not weak. Femininity is not lack of leadership/achievement. Femininity is not lack of agency/stupidity/subservience.\n\n\n\nA strong man loves a strong woman and isn't threatened by her. A strong man isn't threatened by femininity, in clothing or jewellery. A man is not \"weakened\" by a dress. If you believe that when a man wears a dress, he loses agency, strength, and ability to defend the civilization, do you believe that women, since they wear dresses, lack agency and strength? To me, you saying feminizing men is a problem is saying that femininity is a problem...ie., it is bad/weak and not meant for 'strong, proper' men.\n\n\nBut you say, men and women are meant for different roles? How did these roles help the self esteem of women? Thanks to these roles, women could not pursue a career, make money, choose/judge their partners, or achieve things. It was the 'role' of men. If you feel it is perfectly fine for women to do the afore mentioned things, then that means women are strong and admirable, and men are not weakened by femininity. Please reconsider your ideas on femininity. \n\nRegards,\n\nA person who cannot afford a daily wire subscription to contact you directly.",

    "text": "5 Myths about Reproductive Rights. Myth #1: Reproductive rights is a euphemism for abortion. \n\nTruth: Reproductive rights, as a whole, encompasses far more than just abortions, it also encompasses sterilization surgeries, birth control, prenatal health care, STD/STI tesing and treatment, family planning and a lot more. Believe it nor not, it is actually possible to be anti-abortion but pro reproductive rights. If you are against abortion (believing that it is only justoified in cases were the pregnancy threatens the mother’s life) but you believe that birth control should be available to teenagers with no need for the teenager’s parents permission, birth control should be put in vending machines and be available for $0.75, you should be allowed to get a vasectomy or tubal litigation surgery at Starbucks and that insurane should be required to cover the cost of STD/STI testing and treatment (that last one might already be the law, I don’t know, I am a bit fussy on the exact details of that situation), then you are pro reproductive rights. \n\nMyth #2: People regretting sterilization surgeries is actually a real issue that we need to be concerned about.  \n\nThis one requires a bit of explaining. Technically speaking, even though anyone over the age of 18 is legally allowed to have a sterilization surgery, your doctor might refuse to sterilize you for fear that you may regret it.  \n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC558215/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC558215/) [https://www.vice.com/en\\_us/article/9kxam7/tubal-ligation-requirements-doctor-denials](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kxam7/tubal-ligation-requirements-doctor-denials) [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/parenting/why-dont-more-american-men-get-vasectomies.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/parenting/why-dont-more-american-men-get-vasectomies.html) \n\nIn Belgium, there is a law which says that a woman is not allowed to have a tubal ligation surgery unless she has given birth before OR she is at least 40 years of age. That is discriminatory against childless women under the age of 40. To hear You Tuber Vegan Gains talk about that policy in Belgium, click this link ( [https://youtu.be/8BtzOhQCJfw](https://youtu.be/8BtzOhQCJfw) ). \n\nTruth: If you get sterilized and decide later on that you want kids, you could adopt, hire a surrogate or employ the services of a sperm bank. If, on the other hand, an individual who never wants kids is not allowed to have a sterilization surgery, a child could be born to two parents who are not prepared to take care of him or her. Even if an individual who does have a sterilization surgery goes on to regret it, at least that only affects the one responsible for the sterilization surgery happening. You chose to have that sterilization surgery, so it only affects you, that is completely fair. If you can't get sterilized and you have an unplanned child, that child is statistically more likely to be abused or neglected and is statistically more likely to live in poverty. That isn't fair to the child who had no control over the circumstances of his/her own conception and birth.\n\nMyth #3: In debates about abortion, or other issues pertaining to reproductive rights, an ad hominem attack carries the same weight as an actual argument. \n\nIn debates about abortion, it is common for both pro-life advocates and pro-choice advocates to make ad hominem attacks. For pro-life advocates, they tend to call pro-choice advocates spoiled millenials or stupid femanazis, as if that counts as a real argument. On the other hand, one of the most common arguments used by pro-choice advocates is the “you’re a straight white male argument.” That doesn’t mean that all or even most pro-choice advocates do this, but many do.    \n\nTruth: When debating about abortion, or any issue pertaining to politics for that matter, it is usually better to attack the argument rather than the person. \n\nThis complaint, by many (though not all or even most) pro-choice adovcates about straight white men making laws about women’s reproductive rights is not honest. I know this, because pro-choice advocates are happy about Roe v Wade and that ruling was made by straight white men. These pro-choice advocates actually have a problem with the policies themselves, not the people making them. If congress were trying to outlaw abortion pro-choice adcovates would have a problem with that policy, even if the people supporitng this policy were black lesbians. \n\nMyth #4: Reproductive rights is only a women’s issue. \n\nTruth: Since both men and women are involved in the process of making babies, any law, any policy and decision regarding abortion, birth control, sterilization surgeries, prenatal health care, matrnity/paternity leave etc., will effect both men and women. \n\nMyth #5: Any man who does not want to be responsible for a child who he fathered does not have to. \n\nTruth: The way that reproductive rights currently works, if a woman gets pregnant and chooses to keep the child, she can legally sue the father for child support and he legally has to pay child support to the child, until the child is of age. The father may not have even wanted to keep the child. He may have wanted the mother to abort and she may have given birth anyway just to spite him, yet he still has to be responsible for the child who he fathered whether he wants to or not. \n\nTo be fair though, there also exist some opposite scenarios where the mother gives the child up for adoption, the father gets custody of the child and the mother is forced to pay child support. \n\nTo hear more about reproductive rights and the controversy thereof, check out these links. \n\n[https://youtu.be/h83Hi-4hbvc](https://youtu.be/h83Hi-4hbvc) \n\n[https://youtu.be/PeaO-D1cP5I](https://youtu.be/PeaO-D1cP5I) \n\n[https://youtu.be/JRdq2zqGxgY](https://youtu.be/JRdq2zqGxgY) \n\n[https://youtu.be/UFYxlmRRnkw](https://youtu.be/UFYxlmRRnkw) \n\n[https://youtu.be/Z3UmXu97yRQ](https://youtu.be/Z3UmXu97yRQ) \n\n[https://youtu.be/50UCPLmNdnM](https://youtu.be/50UCPLmNdnM) \n\n[https://youtu.be/lr4zz9JPHig](https://youtu.be/lr4zz9JPHig)",
