    "text": "Waiting for decision for a job I really want (+2 days and counting) I was terminated last December from a hedge fund due to a very toxic fallout (the person doing the firing couldn't look me in the eyes). And I spent about a month and a half after that trying to heal from the situation. I was burnt out going into the job search, and only applied to 2 companies that I was sure would not be toxic (I am in tech so there are always jobs available and almost every well-known place there is reputation of a bro culture). One of them turned out to be a dream job. I never knew I would be excited to work again. Anyways, final round went smoothly, or so I thought, and the recruiter said they'd reach a decision sometime a week later. It's now been 8 days and a follow-up email later, and I still haven't heard back anything. I restarted the application process, now armed with the optimism that maybe I can find a job that I love in an environment that doesn't belittle or despise me. It was hard coming to terms with a job that felt so right was not meant to be yesterday, but I suppose that is a part of life.\n\nEdit (Context): I am an Asian female in STEM. As the only woman on all teams I've been in, it feels like I've been fighting to belong my whole life. Yesterday I watched a tiktok video of a black woman receiving feedback about being perceived as aggressive and threatening despite sitting at a meeting quietly and saying nothing while a white guy jumped up and down and cursed at the same meeting and received no feedback. My problems are probably not as egregious, but I am struggling with the same question: how do you act on feedback that is about what you are instead of what  you did? My mother tells me that it is okay and just do my best. But today when I talked to recruiters that don't see any limits for me and were talking about aiming for directors and principals, I just feel like crying ||\\_\\_\\_\\_||.",

I just watched Moxxi on Netflix, and it hit strong on all the right and wrong places.\n\nLike, *spoilers* the principal at their school refused to acknowledge anything the boys were doing because it would be paperwork and headache for her, what prompted the girls to start a feminist group.\n\nIt also reminded me when my cousin (13F) called me to talk about how her school had an argument if queer people and women *should* have rights.\n\nWe shouldn't have those arguments, shouldn't have rights, shouldn't have to endure shit. But because we shouldn't need to.\n\nWe are still people, but since we're not white straight males, we aren't seen as such.\n\nLemme tell yall, the Bible, aka white people base fit many things in life? No whites. It's in the middle East/Africa! Jesus? He's black. And a nice guy overall, but the fandom kinda sucks.\n\nSo why is it that whites are seen as better? Don't get me wrong, I'm a white as milk girl in Brazil, but it still bugs me that people use of religion to justify racism and many other forms of prejudice.\n\nAnd then there's the issue of misogyny.\n\nWe can't do anything by ourselves, go to the corner store alone, without being sexualised in any way! I work gigs in a bar nearby and the amount of guys plainly harassing me and the other girl that works with me sometimes. Not only flirts, but straight on harassment.\n\nAnyway... Thanks for coming to my (not so)TED Talk. You'll find chocolate chip cookies and no lactose milk at the back!",

    "text": "I Threw Away My Xanax I am a very fortunate human being in that I was born without any mental health issues to speak of, which is to say naturally and without outside cause, I don't suffer from depression or anxiety. It's now been two years since I left teaching. Today I was cleaning out my bathroom closet and found the Xanax I was prescribed back in the days when I would cry multiple times a day, get yelled at by admins, get verbally and physically assaulted by the kids, get called a \"bitch\" several times an hour, start trembling as I got in my car to drive to work every morning, got gaslit by a toxic principal who would literally witness a student insult me and then genuinely say \"he didn't say that\" when I asked for disciplinary actions, hear literal little boys say sexually explicit things about me well aware that I could hear every word, got a black eye from a student, lost a great relationship because I would spend every weekend in a Xanax and wine haze just to suppress my deep emotional pain and trauma, and basically live like a depressed, anxious and ill person who barely washed her dishes and spent all non-working moments on the couch staring at Netflix and not even really watching it and who'd quit all her fitness pursuits and personal hobbies.\n\nAfter the black eye incident I left and never came back. I moved in with my parents. At first I was still taking the Xanax to deal withe the PTSD of it all and the feeling of being an utter failure for living with mommy and daddy as an adult. But then when the pandemic happened and we went into lockdown, I started to know more people who moved back home, so the shame I felt dissipated. \n\nAs the months progressed, I started to feel like my old self again. I dove into self-care and became the queen of home workouts, hobbies, meditation and journaling. I applied to nursing school - stress I can handle, abuse I cannot - and am loving my studies and the friends I've made, which include two former teachers who share my story. I decided to say \"fuck it\" completely to *any* societal stigmas about living at home and have been loving spending time with my folks and my teenage brother, who turns out is an incredibly intelligent and thoughtful young man, and I almost missed his adolescence completely because I never socialized while trapped in an abusive job. I got to get my teaching kicks by helping him during the pandemic and I think having his own personal tutor will do wonders to ensure that he's academically thriving come college. (Also his sweet little romance with his adorable girlfriend is my own personal \"Riverdale.\" Their occasional mini breakups are hilariously melodramatic, as teenage love tends to be.)\n\nToday I found a half-full Xanax bottle, with my name and a 2019 date, and I threw it in the trash. I don't need it medically, and I don't want to take it recreationally.\n\nI don't know who in the thick of it needs to hear this today, but you don't have to live like an abuse victim under the guise of a career. You don't have to put the needs of the three \"good kids\" in your room over your own personal mental health. You don't have to spend every day in a never-ending panic attack. There's another life waiting for you and there's no chain holding you to that desk.",

    "text": "Ridiculous teacher dress code I was recently reminded of the ridiculous dress code at my first job. It was a public school that required uniforms for students - white shirt, navy or khaki pants/shorts/skirt. Teachers were required to wear only those 3 colors - navy, white, and khaki (though not necessarily in the same pattern as students - I had a solid navy dress I wore all the time). It was supposed to create community or something like that and it was enforced by the principal. Black dress pants were a big no no. \n\nI’ve never heard of anything like this since, so I was just wondering if anyone else ever had to deal with a dress code policy this restrictive?",

    "text": "First week in, and already a parent has been rude to me. To be fair, I'm no stranger to entitled parents. They can be loud, they can be dramatic, they can be passive-aggressive... But **this** is the first time one of them left me almost dumbfounded with their display of rudeness.\n\nSo, our junior high students are meant to finish classes at 14.30. Parents are supposed to collect them by 15.00 hrs *at the latest*. I don't know how it works in the USA or other countries but, where I live, private schools such as ours aren't supposed to keep students in school after 15.00 unless we're offering \"afterschool activities\" (which, due to COVID, we're not doing at the moment), lest we get penalised (financially) by authorities.\n\nFirst week back to school, and one of my students' mothers is consistently late. Every. Single. DAY.\n\nShe ends up appearing at 15.15, 15.30, 15.35... Not because she works, mind you - she just has \"a lot of stuff to do\" which apparently is more important than picking up her 9th-grade son...\n\nToday, I was on duty. Clock strikes 15.00 and, of course, my student's mum is nowhere to be found. He tries to call her several times, but she won't answer. Clock strikes 15.30... Then 16.00... By now, the teen, my principal, the janitor and I are the only people left at school, since no relatives can be reached and we can't just leave the teen alone in the building.\n\nEventually, the principal had to leave because he had a meeting. Fast-forward until my watch read 18.46 (I've never stayed at any school building so late) and a car finally appeared at the entrance. Since this was becoming an everyday occurrence and we could get in trouble for it, I approached the car and tried to talk to this \"mother\"...\n\nThe teen was all curled up in the back seat, looking embarrassed as hell, while I was explaining to his mother why we couldn't afford to stay so late at school looking after one child, that we can't offer \"afterschool activities\" as of yet... She gave me the nastiest bitch face I've ever seen on a human being and said that maybe she'll just get her son out of our school and that would solve the problem (I guess some parents in private schools truly think that threatening to take their kid out is the ultimate menace, huh?)\n\nI started to reply that it was a decision that she had to talk over with the principal, when she simply rolled up her window - yup, while I was *still* talking to her.\n\nMy reaction was to smile sweetly and yell, \"Well, good day to you!\" as she closed her window and drove away, but maaaan... Deep down, I honestly wanted to crack her windshield open, grab her by the throat, beat her black and green, and split her skull open!!\n\nI don't get paid to be disrespected, and especially not by some f\\*cking jerk that thinks it's okay to leave her son alone for over 4 hours like it's nothing.\n\nI feel really bad and sad for the student, and I'm still feeling murderous.",

    "text": "Did we forget that we are teaching children?? This is my 3rd year teaching (graduated just in time for the pandemic to hit-- lucky me) and I sometimes wonder if my administration forgets that we are teaching actual children, not just numbers filling a seat. \n\nI think that my educational philosophy doesn't align with my school's. Admin is, in my opinion, far too strict on things that I could give a rat's ass about, but not strict enough on stuff that actually matters. For example, a student was sent to the principal's office for wearing a jacket that had both red and black. Students are only allowed to wear jackets that are solidly black or solidly red. I would love if someone could explain to me how a student wearing red and black is disruptive enough to the learning environment that administration needs to get involved. \n\nToday, I was \"reminded of my professional obligations to make sure that my boards are free of anything not directly linked to teaching and learning.\" I have a side board that I write reminders and homework on, but I don't use the whole board. Since it's not at the front of the room, I don't mind if students write or draw on the board in between classes or at lunch. The students have never written or drawn anything inappropriate. I personally do not see the harm in allowing students to write or draw on the board as, in my mind, they are just kids being kids. Why does everything have to be picked apart like that? Why can't kids draw on the boards? They're children. They draw. \n\nThis year has been emotionally exhausting and my administration seems to be wildly out of touch. I don't know how much longer I can make it in this profession. Hats off to those of you who have stuck around for awhile, but I think my days of being in the classroom are numbered.",

    "text": "Angry Parent is Threatening Me I have a student named Derek (not his real name). Derek is not one of my favorite students, though I would certainly never indicate any of the kind to him or to any of my students.\n\nHe's something of a tattle tell and a trouble maker. During pre-Covid times, he would poke another student with a pencil. The student would ask him to stop. After he continued poking the other student, his pencil would be snatched away, snapped in half, and dropped on the floor.\n\n\"TEACHER! TEACHER!\" Derek would shout (even though he knows my name along with the fact that most of my students call me \"chef\" because I'm the chef instructor of a Culinary Arts program).\n\n\"\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ stole my pencil and broke it!\"\n\n\"Were you poking him with it?\"\n\nDerek would study his feet. \"I dunno. Maybe.\"\n\n\"Did he ask you to stop?\"\n\n\"I don't remember.\"\n\n\"Did you poke him again after he asked you to stop?\"\n\n\"HE BROKE MY PENCIL!\"\n\nAfter telling the other student not to take pencils away from Derek or to snap them in half, I returned to my instruction. Derek had other plans. At home he tattled on me to his mother by offering a one sided perspective. \"And I wasn't doing ANYTHING and a bully took my pencil away and broke it. I told teacher and he didn't do ANYTHING.\"\n\nIncensed over how I had allowed her precious high school freshman to be \"bullied,\" Mama Bear would start to metaphorically poking me.\n\n\"WHY ARE YOU ALLOWING MY SON TO BE BULLIED?\" she would demand via email. \"RESPOND AT ONCE!\"\n\nI typically do not reply \"at once.\" I usually wait for 24 hours. Since I've had lots of prior experiences with this kid (who was also with me as an 8th grader), I knew that it didn't matter what I said because the truth doesn't matter. This parent was prepared to believe anything her son had to say. She was equally prepared to believe that anything I had to say was a lie.\n\nShe's played this game with other teachers. With other teachers she's also played the race card. \"YOU HATE MY CHILD BECAUSE HE'S BLACK!\" The other teachers have all been white.\n\nShe has NOT played this game with me because I'm not white. I'm Asian. I'm even more of a minority than this parent is.\n\nThis hasn't stopped her from relentlessly badgering me.\n\n\"MY SON CLAIMS HE TURNED AN ASSIGNMENT IN BUT HIS GRADE SAYS THAT IT'S MISSING. EXPLAIN!\"\n\nI checked and found that although I had graded an assignment on Canvas (our instructional platform), for reasons unknown, this grade wasn't carried over to our electronic gradebook (Infinite Campus). I sent Derek's mother a thank you note for having brought this to my attention. I explained that Canvas had not transferred these grades to Infinite Campus. I told her that I had reported this to IT and had updated Derek's grades.\n\n\"WHY DOES HE ONLY HAVE A 71?\"\n\nI explained that his low GPA came from the fact that he had only earned a 70 on a unit test. Since the district has required us to weight all tests at 90% of a student's GPA, all test grades are really important.\n\n\"WHY HAS HIS GRADE FLUCTUATED?\"\n\nI have no idea what she meant by this question. Grade point averages change as new grades are added. This is basic math. Instead of saying this to her, I told her firmly but politely that I had addressed her concern about a missing grade and thanked her again for bringing this matter to my attention.\n\nShe's now threatening to complain about me to the district office because I'm rude and I'm allegedly not answering her questions.\n\nI am not worried. She shot her credibility with the district many years ago after she tried to convince the assistant superintendent that our principal, the assistant principal, and all of Derek's teachers \"hate\" her son because he's black.\n\nThis woman has reportedly been screaming at teachers and building administrators ever since her son was enrolled in kindergarten. She will doubtlessly continue to complain so long as Derek remains enrolled in our school.\n\nLucky us.\n\n(sigh)",

    "text": "I hate parent teacher conferences! My school always does PT conferences early in the year, about midway through the first quarter. I don’t really know why. But anyway our conferences were today and tomorrow.\n\nI had one parent bring an issue to my attention that was pretty serious. Her son (who is white) told her that a girl in our class (the girl is black) has been threatening him, telling him to fuck off, or shut the fuck up. When his mom told me this I was surprised because this student has never mentioned anything of this nature to me or another teacher, as far as I know. But I told her that if it happens again, he needs to tell an adult, whoever he is near at the time.\n\nAs chance would have it, my very next scheduled conference was the girl in question. I felt I should bring it up, but I also knew I had to be careful because I have no proof of anything. So I just mentioned to the girl’s mom that I had gotten a report of her daughter possibly using very inappropriate language with another student. I emphasized that I didn’t know if there was any truth to it, but I encouraged her to just speak with her daughter to see if she’s having any issues with other students. The mom knew right away who I was talking about even though I never mentioned his name. She said this student repeatedly makes racist remarks towards her daughter, makes fun of her hair, her skin, calls her fat, and has evidently called her the n-word. She did agree that if her daughter used the bad language that was not an appropriate response though, and said she would bring it up at home. Again, just as before, this girl has never mentioned anything of this sort to me or any other teacher. I told her that the next time this happens, her daughter needs to tell an adult right away.\n\nSo I really don’t know what to think. Maybe they’re both telling the truth, maybe not. But I can’t do anything if the students don’t let anyone know when this is happening. Either way, I’m going to speak with my principal tomorrow.\n\nDid I mention I hate conferences? Ugh.",

    "text": "Coming Full Circle / Le Cordon Bleu & the Public School System I'm a dual certified teacher with 17 years as an elementary teacher and 14 years and counting in Culinary Arts. Despite having lived and worked in two different warzones as an expatriate teacher in the international American schools, nothing in my 31 years of experience could have prepared me for the past year. In reading the posts on this board, I have seen many complaints about lax district attendance requirements for virtual education and hybrid. I have also seen a growing number of posts about administrative pressure to inflate grades given how abysmally some students have become during the current crisis.\n\nWhile I have not had any first experience with grade inflation at my school, in an effort to \"improve\" our attendance rates, my district has unintentionally undermined our virtual instruction. Per district policy, we are required to mark students present if any one of the following conditions were met.\n\n1. The student attended your virtual class. (It doesn't matter if the student just logged in and then logged out without bothering to stay for instruction. The mere fact that he or she even bothered to log on counts towards attendance credit for that student's class.)\n2. The student didn't log into your virtual class but did log onto Canvas which is our instructional support platform where we keep all student lessons and assignments. If a student logged into Canvas on the day you had your virtual class, that student will be marked as present.\n3. If the student sends his or her teacher an email on the day you had a virtual class, that student will be marked present.\n\nThe students aren't stupid. A lot of them have milked the system and my attendance rate has dropped to the point where I only have 1-2 students out of a class of 16 who bother to attend any of my virtual classes.\n\nConcurrent with the bad attendance has been the growing failure of students to complete any of my assignments. At least 40% of my students are failing. Some haven't even logged onto Canvas in two months.\n\nI think there are a lot of parallels between what's been happening in many of our public school systems and what happened to the American division of the Le Cordon Bleu culinary schools.\n\nIn France, Le Cordon Bleu is a widely respected and venerated culinary school that was first opened in 1895. Throughout the last 126 years, a succession of great chefs have taught the next generation of culinarians whose ranks have included the likes of Julia Childs, Giada De Laurentiis, and Mario Batali\n\nIn 2000 Le Cordon Bleu entered into a partnership with Career Education Corp. (CEC), a company that bought up private vocational schools in the United States.  Instead of adopting the Le Cordon Bleu curriculum and standards, the CEC slapped the Le Cordon Bleu logo on their culinary uniforms and campus signage. When the American division first opened, these schools included the Southern California School of Culinary Arts of Pasadena, California; the Western Culinary Institute of Portland, Oregon; the International Culinary Academy of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; the Scottsdale Culinary institute of Scottsdale, Arizona; and the Midwest Culinary Academy of Mendota Heights, Minnesota. In time, the American maintained and operated 16 schools. Trading upon the Le Cordon Bleu name, at the height of their popularity these schools generated an annual net revenue of some $100 million dollars.\n\nAs a 2003 Le Cordon Bleu graduate, I had the dubious distinction of watching this school begin its slow decline almost from the moment it first opened its doors. After having burned out as an elementary teachers after 17 years in the profession, I cashed out my Texas Teacher Retirement account to pay for my tuition at the Texas Culinary Academy in Austin. I was 40 years old at the time. My father still insists that I was having a mid-life crisis.\n\nMy class had about forty students. While most of the students were recent high school graduates, our very oldest classmate was in his 50's, though a life of hard living had made him look a decade older. I was the 2nd oldest student in the class. There were also a handful of students in their 30's. The ranks of the older students included a registered nurse, a veteran who had mustered out after 20 years in the service, a pastor, a computer engineer, and a restaurant line cook.\n\nOur school uniforms consisted of white culinary jackets with the Le Cordon Bleu logo emblazoned over the left chest. We also wore herring bone black and white cook trousers, black socks, and close toed non-skid shoes, along with a white skull cap. In addition to our textbook, we were each issued a black tool kit that included a complete knife set.\n\nAlthough the CEC had published and distributed a set of student handbooks that outlined the school rules and expectations, these standards were rarely applied. In theory, students who were late to class should have been barred from attendance and made to attend a Saturday makeup session. In reality, none of the chef instructors seemed to care if students were as much as 30 minutes late.\n\nStudents were expected to come to class wearing clean uniforms. In reality, some students came to class wearing jackets that were stained with ingredients that had been used during the previous day. One student even showed up wearing sandals with black socks. The chef instructor let this student stay even though his clothing was a health code safety violation.\n\nA lot of the younger students didn't bother doing their reading assignments or their written homework. Many of these didn't even bother to take notes in class before we went to the kitchen for our hands-on production lessons.\n\nSince most culinary classes teach students in cooperative learning groups of 3-4, the older students banded together into two groups out of vested self interest. We did this because we had work ethics and standards. We read the assignments. We completed the written homework. We also took notes.\n\nDuring our lab time in the kitchen, many of the younger students would disappear for extended smoke breaks of 30 minutes or longer. They wouldn't help with production. They wouldn't help with cleaning the kitchen. Since we were working in cooperative groups, each group shared a common grade. Those of us who were responsible didn't think that these other students deserved to share our grade since they made no contributions to our group effort.\n\nAt the end of our course of study, as part of our graduation requirement we were expected to complete a three month externship under the supervision of a chef or a kitchen manager. Students who had been allowed to develop slovenly habits and to show up late for class had a rude awakening when they tried to act the same way in the commercial food service.\n\nEven though the Le Cordon Bleu schools were still relatively new, by the time I got to my externship, it was hard finding anyone who would take me. The Texas Culinary Academy had already developed a dismal reputation among most of the area restaurants. Students were late to work. Students were improperly attired. Students thought they could get away with 30 minute smoke breaks. Those students who hadn't paid attention in class and who had not assisted in the kitchen were quite out of their depth and lacked the basic skills that a culinary extern should have had.\n\nI was lucky. I eventually found a placement with a boutique hotel that had an attached French restaurant. I completed my externship without problems and graduated with honors. As with nearly anything else in life, what I got out of the program reflected what I had put into it. I went on to work in the food service for five years before returning to education as the chef instructor of a high school Culinary Arts program.\n\nI was successful. A lot of my former classmates were not. Since Le Cordon Bleu did not hold their students to high standards, their reputation suffered. In time, student externs could not find placements. Le Cordon Bleu graduates could not find jobs.  In 2015, CEC tried to sell their schools but the Le Cordon Bleu label was so badly tarnished in the United States that they wound up announcing their pending closure. No new enrollments were accepted after January of 2016. The last classes graduated in September of 2017.\n\nLe Cordon Bleu is an example of what can happen when you don't enforce high expectations regarding attendance, student participation, and grades.\n\nI started teaching in 1982 before President George Bush's No Child Left Behind Act ushered in accountability testing. For those of you who are old enough to recall what teaching was like BEFORE accountability testing you may remember that some schools and some districts had similar lax standards.\n\nBefore accountability testing, elementary students were often \"socially promoted.\" It didn't matter that these students were failing and had cruddy attendance. During my first elementary teaching job in a Title I district on the south Texas border, my principal told me that kids who were retained would suffer worse from the emotional trauma of being left behind than if they were promoted with \"a few\" academic deficiencies.\n\nAlthough I was a novice teacher at the time, I remember thinking that my 5th grade students were 2-3 grade levels deficient in both reading and math. If the principal thought that these were \"a few\" academic deficiencies, I couldn't help wondering what a glaring deficiency might have looked like.\n\nThe problem with having lax standards was that some schools were graduating students who were functional illiterates. Back in 1977, the U.S. Office of Education estimated that an estimated 23 MILLION American adults were functional illiterates who lacked the ability to read restaurant menus and train schedules.\n\nIn 1976, a student named [Peter W. sued the San Francisco Unified School District](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/217048241.pdf) because they had graduated him even though he was only on a 5th grade reading level and had failed several grades. The plaintiff alleged that in failing to properly educate him, he had been relegated to a life of manual labor since this was all that he was qualified to do. The trial court dismissed the complaint. This was subsequently upheld upon appeal because Peter W's failure of educational achievement was not accepted by the court as an \"injury: within the meaning of tort law.\n\nAnother lawsuit followed. In 1976 [Edward Donohue](https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/20/archives/a-graduate-who-says-he-cant-read-saying-he-is-functionally.html) was graduated even though he couldn't read at all. In 1977, he sued his former school for \"educational malpractice.\"\n\nHis lawsuit alleged that even though he had failed all of his classes during his junior year (except for woodshop), he was socially promoted and became a senior. He was even placed in a senior English class despite having failed English as a junior.\n\nDoes any of this sound familiar to our current education climate?\n\nThe teachers at Mr. Donohue's former high school said that there was an unofficial rule that said that they could not fail more than 15% of their students. Instead of actually educating their students, there was pressure from the building administration to graduate students as a way of getting rid of them.\n\nI  wish I could say that Edward Donohue had a fortuitous outcome to his lawsuit. I am sorry to say that he did not. In 1977 in [Donohue v Copiague Unified School District](https://www.leagle.com/decision/197948747ny2d4401440), the court found in favor of the district. The summary statement alluded to, \"the practical impossibility of proving that the alleged malpractice of the teacher proximately caused the learning deficiency of the plaintiff student. Factors such as the student's attitude, motivation, temperament, past experience and home environment may all play an essential and immeasurable role in learning. Indeed as the majority observes proximate cause might 'be difficult, if not impossible, to prove'.\"\n\nIt wasn't until 1981 ([Hoffman v. Board of Education](https://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1427&context=hlr)) that a plaintiff was (partially) successful in pursuing an educational malpractice lawsuit. Daniel Hoffman was a student in the New York City Schools. At the age of five the school district placed him in a class for the mentally retarded. He remained in this class for the next 12 years despite the fact that a school psychologist had insisted that he wasn't retarded but instead suffered from a low self image. Although the court awarded the plaintiff $500,000 in damages, this judgement was reversed upon appeal and the case was dismissed.\n\nThe reality for all of us is that this isn't 1976, 1977, or 1981. It's 2021 and the times have changed.\n\nIn 2016,  a high school graduate Jamarria Hall joined a class action lawsuit with six former students in suing the Detroit public schools because the district was graduating students who were illiterate. As a junior and later a senior Mr. Hall alleged that his English teachers taught him using 3rd and 4th grade level books.  His attorney alleged that his former school was literally falling apart and lacked certified teachers and up-to-date textbooks. It argued that conditions were so appalling that in one instance an 8th grade student took the initiative to teach math to his classmates for a month after his teacher quit and the school was unable to find a replacement.\n\nIn May of 2020, after four long years of legal battles, the Detroit Public Schools settled and agreed to pay the seven former students a total of $7 million to settle this education malpractice claim. In settling they have also created a legal precedent for future education malpractice claims.\n\nThe implications of this recent case should be clear. School districts may successfully be sued for educational malpractice. While school administrators seek short term relief by having teachers inflate grades so as to appease the school board and angry parents, if these practices were to continue, it could have serious legal implications in the years to come.\n\nNot to detract from the validity of anything that I have said, but this is also why teachers should belong to a union. Most unions offer legal representation and liability coverage as part of their benefits.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nEdited: I graduated from Le Cordon Bleu, Texas Culinary Academy in 2003, not 2001.

    "text": "The One About Air Conditioning... This was inspired by another post, and happened a few years back. Couldn't decide on the most appropriate flair.\n  \nMy building often hit 80 degrees or above from April to October. Whenever the HVAC was \"fixed,\" it would only work for a few days. You couldn't get a technician out again for a month. \n  \nIt got bad. Black mold started growing in a building that was only 10 years old at the time. The building was already over capacity, and rooms often smelled like a locker room. On top of this, our building has a modern design. Many rooms have no windows, and the majority of windows we do have will not open. I had taken photos of thermometers, and instances of black mold, and told my supervisor- several times.\n  \nThen after years of inaction, I made a DIY AC out of a styrofoam cooler, PVC pipes, and a desk fan. I would grab a bag of ice on my way into work every day. This did not solve the problem, but gave me some relief for the first half of the day. Plus- I have a few medical conditions that are compounded by heat.\n  \nIt was still enough to cause a stink in my building though... That along with the body odor of 2,000 students.\n   \nYou see- I refused to aim the fan towards the class. My money, my contraption, my comfort. Several kids complained to me that they were hot too, and I told them I know exactly how they feel- which is why I took things into my own hands. I encouraged them to be creative in how they managed their comfort while in the building, and to have their parents let admin know about their discomfort.  \n  \nNext thing you know, I'm getting called in to my admin's office, and she flat out asks \"have I been telling students to have their parents contact them?\" \n  \n\"Yes.\"  \n  \nBut seriously, lady... What did you think was going to happen. The HVAC has not worked properly in 5 years. I, along with just about every other teacher in the building, have complained throughout the course of this time, and nothing.  \n  \n\"You can't do that!\"  \n  \n\"Why?\"\n  \n\"It looks bad.\"\n  \n\"And having class in a 90 degree room, with no windows and no ventilation looks good?\"\n  \n\"Did you build a portable AC?\" \n  \n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You can't do that either!\"\n  \n\"Why?\"\n  \n\"It's not safe.\" \n  \n\"And the black mold that has been found throughout the building, likely from that lack of ventilation, is?\"\n  \n\"And you're not sharing the device with the rest of the class? Why is that?\" \n  \n\"My money, my comfort. Plus, two seconds ago it was unsafe. I wouldn't want it to harm the students.\"\n  \n\"And you told the students to get creative in how they manage their comfort? What does that mean?\" \n  \n\"I don't know- if I did that wouldn't be very creative would it?\"\n \n\"Does that mean violate the dress code?\"\n  \n\"Never said that- but these are young adults. Their body; their decisions on whether they follow arbitrary rules.\"\n  \n\"What about bringing in fans and other contraptions like you have? This would be unsafe and disruptive to the learning environment! We would have to assume liability if anything happened!\"\n  \n\"You are finally starting to get the hint! These conditions are uncomfortable, unsafe, unsanitary, and completely disruptive... Yet the school has not taken accountability, despite their liability.\" \n  \n\"You're crossing a line.\"\n   \n\"\"What rule have I broken?\" \n  \n\"I'm sure I can find one or two.\"\n \n\"I see. This is about asserting control, not about enforcing policy. Do what you have to do. But when you do, this will be escalated. I can get doctor's notes that will force your compliance with certain accommodations. I'm also sure that the local news would love to see those pictures I took and shared with you of the mold and thermometers. I'm also sure that disciplining me after bringing these items to you and other sources within the community, would constitute some sort of retaliatory violation- that HR would love to hear about. The ball's in your court. I'm just trying to get by, and not die of heat stroke in the process.\"\n  \nShe said she'd talk it over with the building Principal.  \n  \nI was completely expecting a disciplinary meeting, but the gods intervened. About a week after this happened, a few buildings in my district had their HVAC systems test positive for Legionella bacteria. Two teachers in my building had contracted Legionaires disease during that current school year, and this came to light after the HVAC story hit the news. \n  \nThis was a huge controversy in my area, and building maintenance has never been more scrutinized. That Summer, they actually fixed the HVAC units in building, and the new contractor said that proper maintenance schedules had not been performed since the units were installed.  \n  \nNever got disciplined formally, but I've definitely been on some sort of shot list since.",

    "text": "Tales from a Title 1: Why I left I was a first year teacher. But I'm not fresh. I graduated in 2018. We put my husband through grad school while I stayed home with our first kid. We moved back to our hometown and I got a job at my old middle school. I was not prepared for the storm ahead me....\n\nLet's begin with what happened during PD before school started. I was told the principal, had been a little off the rails. The year prior he had a mental breakdown during STAAR testing and took two, 3 week leaves. Well during PD he would make rambling speeches about CRT, he made racist comments about \"nappy\" hair and went on about how teachers should dress appropriately because the male students will want to have sex with them. The Friday before school starts, the superintendent came to a meeting and told us he was put on leave and we would have interim. So that's how the year starts. Here is a list of things that happened: \n\n- A student threatened to shoot up my classroom. \n\n- A student caressed my hair and nothing was done. \n\n- A student attempted to hug me and put his arms on me, nothing was done. \n\n- A female student grabbed my butt in the hallway, nothing was done. \n\n- A student that was only a day back from county, threatened to put his hands on me if I didn't move from the door. \n\n- Kids were passing weed around in my classroom and only questioned one and did nothing else about it. \n\n- Multiple fights, weed smoking in the bathroom and absolutely no respect from the students in my classroom. \n\n- A white student was constantly harassing black students calling them N words, sexually harassing female students and even said he was going to rape one and nothing happened. \n\n- My speaker was stolen for two days (but returned by a good student) and admin scoffed because it was returned \n\nThe list goes on. I put my 5 day week notice on Monday. Yesterday was my last day. On Wednesday a student told me \"so now that you quit does that mean I can hit it\" and made an obscene gesture at me. I was having vertigo, wasn't sleeping, stomach pains and more. It was too much. I got a remote job as a talent acquisition coordinator. When other teachers found out I was leaving, they were begging for advice on how to get a new job. Some of my sweet students cried, begged me to stay and brought me going away gifts. But it's not enough. \n\nThe state of education is a flaming pile of shit. And now I'm sick and depressed thinking of what to do for my own children.",

    "text": "Getting tired of teachers who tell other teachers how to do their job I’m on a new team this year in my school. Switched grade levels from 7th to 6th this year. We are team of 4. I absolutely LOVE two of the ladies I work with. The last one...not so much.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, she is actually a fabulous teacher in the classroom. But she’s one of these people who thinks her shit doesn’t stink and constantly tells everyone else what they should or should not be doing. And she has no problem telling someone else that they need to do something, but if anyone tells her she needs to help out too, she either finds an excuse why she shouldn’t, or will do it but act like you’re really infringing on her time. \n\nHere’s an example: at a faculty meeting last week, our principal told everyone she would like each team to do a project for Black history month in February, and explained what topics she would like each grade to focus on. Basically we are splitting the kids into pairs and having them research the topic, and make a poster to display (so much for social distancing here...). Our classes are supposed to focus on important Black military heroes. Anyways, this teacher on my team immediately informed my partner and I that we should be the ones to handle this project for our team, and that we need to dedicate time in our classes (reading and English) at least once a week in February to do this project since it’s research and writing based. I pointed out that it was also very much history based, and asked if she would be dedicating any of her social studies classes to it. She kinda rolled her eyes and said, “well I GUESS I can if you really think that’s necessary and can’t handle it.”\n\nAnother example: Today at dismissal one of my students was on her phone in the hall. I didn’t see it but this other teacher clearly did. She marched up to me with the phone in hand, told me what happened and said “you need to write this up.” I said, “you’re the one who saw it. Shouldn’t you be the one to write it up?” She looked really annoyed and then said “whatever, if you don’t want to do it then I guess I’ll have to.” Bitch, you are her teacher too. It doesn’t matter whose homeroom the student is in. If you saw it, write it up yourself!\n\nShe just gets under my skin. Thank God she’s not my direct partner though. I feel bad for the other teacher who works opposite her.",

    "text": "Growing as a Black Lady I’m not sure how to write this, but I’m about to move out of my white community that I spent the majority of my life in. I’m just beginning to see that a lot of the trauma I’ve experienced in life is from racist white people and systematic racism, and I’m  done. I think I just need to rant therapeutically.\n\nMy black parents moved to my area in the 1980s to escape the crack epidemic in the city before I was born. They were very “old school” to say the least. They tried to enroll my sisters in the local Catholic school, and the nun interviewing them asked them “Do you live in *insert only poor predominately black community in three counties here*?”\n\nThey weren’t sure what microaggression the nun was insinuating, but it rubbed them the wrong way. Around town one of the neighbors told my parents the local public school was actually the better option academically. So that’s where my sisters were enrolled. My middle sister actually made out decently, but my oldest sister had a hard time. My middle sister was actually crowned *Miss _*insert town here*” and almost went to the state beauty pageant. Never seen before or after in my town. They were both harassed by the school bus driver (who, years later saw the error of his ways and made sure I wasn’t harassed on his route). The school principal and teachers made a point of humiliating my oldest sister. When my sister brought it up to my parents, my parents said “well it’s not like they’re turning the hoses on you. Deal with it.” In their old-school mentality. My oldest sister is still in a cocktail of psych meds today from the abuse she received going through this school, including sexual assault. \n\nMe? Where to begin with me? I was the youngest in my entire grade and the only black child at a new school. The first teacher I ever had in elementary school husband was a reknown bigot in town, and said teacher tried her best to make sure I was held back. She never gave me any attention in class. Funny, to go to the next grade level I had to be tested (the deal my parents worked out with the school). The results came back that although I was the youngest in the grade-level, I was academically a whole year ahead of my classmates with just the equivalent of being at best ignored or regularly bullied each day. The way my parents tell it if it wasn’t for the teacher’s union the administration and Board of Ed would have fired her on the spot.\n\nUp until 8th grade it was pretty uneventful on the social front, I was still emotionally immature, but had a small group of girlfriends. Academically I was still ahead of most of my peers, but each year the bullying by the teachers became more and more intense. Could it be an emotionally younger student is an easier target? Sure, but looking back I think the teachers were looking for low-hanging fruit. Starting in 5th grade, I remember a teacher who liked to bully low-hanging fruit take me aside after another clique tattled on me and said meanly “there’s something wrong with you”. That stuck with me until I started anti-depressants a year ago and was my universal truth. \n\nEnter the guidance counselor. The middle school guidance counselor automatically had me slated as a “bad kid”. I was having a middle school girl fight with one of my girlfriends (truly over something petty). Looking back, I was probably beginning to experience symptoms of childhood depression around age 10 or 11. The middle-school guidance counselor threatened to call the police on me if I upset one of my girlfriends again. She found any excuse to drag me into the principals office (who was a level-headed man, he would just shoo me away within two minutes). 8th grade, there was a switch and my classmates became blatantly racist towards me. No one defended me. We had a new principal 8th grade and he enabled the bullies towards me. Looking back, I was not only depressed, but had begun to exhibit some symptoms of OCD. I had my first panic attack over these bigoted bullies when I was 13. I never told my parents as I was completely shut down and silent at home.\n\nEnter high school, long story short... more of the same. I was not accepted by my white peers, and the few other black kids at the school did not accept me because I was not “black enough”. During these awkward years I was pushed out of the closet as an lgbtq student. So, it truly felt like “we can’t dislike her because she’s black, but we can dislike her for being bisexual”. I was basically the school pariah. Did I mention when the white students came out of the closet they were elevated to popular levels? Some students were openly racist. Once again due to depression I was shut down and nothing was done about it. My OCD, Panic Disorder, and depression was severe in high school. My OCD came up in untraditional ways than cleaning and hand washing; rather I had scrupulosity, limerace, disordered eating, compulsive exercising, sexual OCD, verbally repeating words/sentences, thought cycling, maladaptive daydreaming, and excoriation disorder. Do you want to know what an obsession feels like? Imagine having intrusive, anxiety provoking thoughts on an topic ALWAYS. Sometimes it’s something average about work or school. Sometimes they are grossly inappropriate like socially-unacceptable sexual thoughts. Or anything in-between. Always. When you wake up, when you go to bed, during the SATs and GREs, at your grandma’s funeral. Always! You cannot turn that off. People don’t understand.\n\nWanna know what a compulsion feels like? You know that feeling when your having sex and you’re about to cum? That’s what the build up feels like. When you orgasm, that’s what engaging in the compulsion feels like. So, every time I engaged in religious rituals (my family was Catholic so it was hella easy for this aspect of my OCD to fly under the radar for a while), that I HAD to do or I was damned to hell, this is what it felt like. If I didn’t engage in a religious ritual, it was panic attack inducing.  That’s just ONE aspect of my compulsive nature. As an adult, I stay away from all organized religion. I’m very happy with this decision.\n\nThis was in the early 2000s. Even in my awkward teenage years I was intelligent, I knew something was “wrong”, but when I approached “safe” adults to say something was up I was told I was “looking for attention”. I tried to see my high school guidance counselor, but it became clear that she may have thought she could start an inappropriate relationship with me. She laughed off my concerns and enabled rumors that we were dating. When it got scary, I mustered up the little strength I could and told her to F off and never talk to me again. I was still shut down at home so my parents didn’t know what was going on. They also knew something was “wrong”, but instead of helping me get the help I need, they just screamed at me to “be normal” until a panic attack was induced. My parents would once again say “there’s something wrong with you.”\n\nStarting in college, at a PWI, I finally began healing and I was accepted for who I was. I went to therapy regularly and I truly bloomed.  \nI was still bullied by mean racist girls, but I had a circle of friends who would shut them down because it was the right thing. For the first time, my college had a multi-cultural club, and I had black girlfriends and I began to learn what it meant to be a black lady!\n\n\nThroughout my travels in life, I have consistently been rejected because I was either black or not black enough. I’m an educated woman with a successful career. I’m finally moving out of my racist white county. Is it weird that this is bitter sweet? Its gotten more obviously racist over the years. Trump flags are still up. Blue Lives Matter people are silent over the Jan 6 attacks, but the area is truly beautiful. If things were different I wish I could raise a family there. The cherry on top of everything is when another black family moved into town from a predominantly black area. As a good neighbor I went to say hello, excited to have someone else in town who looked like me. The family was very cold me to with the common look I get from some other black people of “not black enough”. \n\nThere are some very good people in this town. This may sound controversial, but a LOT of town cops and local state troopers made public statements during the BLM protests that “Black Lives Matter” over and over again. They marched with BLM, and were uncomfortable at Blue Lives Matter rallies. The whole community is taking steps to embrace inclusiveness and diversity. They are finally having real conversations. \n\nOne of the few things that came out of COVID-19 is that I started anti-depressants. My “old school” black parents were and still are highly embarrassed I attend therapy sessions, and told me my whole childhood that “only people in crisis go to therapy; only people with something wrong with them go on psych meds”. My life became clear and I found the strength to just leave. I realized how severe my Panic Disorder once when I began to take a PRN med for them every week and a half or so. That didn’t count the panic attacks I had behind a closed door at work or simple panic attacks that didn’t warrant a PRN. Since I was 13, I’ve been averaging 2-3 panic attacks a WEEK. I’m in my 30s... My therapist and my primary collaborated to add an additional medication last month, and for the first time ever the OCD symptoms, which have been notably decreasing since a year ago, (heads up they’ve always gone down little by little since talk therapy) went down significantly in the past month. It was like before I could only walk a mile, and out of nowhere I could run a marathon. I still have work to do in that area, but I count my blessings. \n\nHowever, the bigots are getting louder and louder. If you have guessed where I’m from yet, a local politician recently gutted a local anti-hate bill to only list BLM and Antifa as hard groups (if I understood the controversy correctly). A part of me wants to stay and fight for the town I love, but I think this just may be some sunk-cost fallacy. There are maybe four people in my town who I’m going to keep in touch with. This place is not good for my mental health, which is an ongoing project to heal. The area I’m moving to is far more diverse, mix of black, white, and Hispanic. The community over is predominately Indian, black, and Hispanic. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I fit in in my new community. Where I don’t stand out like a sore thumb just for having more melanin to white people; where I’m not teased for speaking the King’s English to other Black people. I love that feeling.\n\nWhat should I do next? I like what I do at work, but I think it’s time to take the next step in my career... also, I hate being one of the only black people as high up as I am in the company (1st world problems, I know)... I really want to find a company that is more diverse. Should I join the NAACP? Links? Or should I just be me and know I’m exactly where I should be in life?\n\nI don’t know... I’ve never been around a large group of black women in my life (the group of black girlfriends I had, though healthy and fabulous, was small). Have any of you ever experienced any of this? What do you recommend the next steps be as a strong black woman on my life journey?",

    "text": "Can someone please give me some encouragement? **TL/DR:  Educators, sons and daughters of educators, and people who attended majority Black schools in underfunded areas, please give me some words of encouragement and support.  I just quit a job and while I don't regret it, I feel like I failed my kids.**\n\nI've posted in other subs about my ongoing experience in the 7th circle of hell these past five weeks.\n\nI'm a kindergarten teacher.  I've been working in long-term sub positions in posh private schools and guest teaching in gifted public schools for 2 or 3 years now.\n\nThis year I landed my first lead teacher role.  I spent maybe $1000 on my classroom.  I spend 10-12+ hours daily making it beautiful, buying supplies, a printer, watercolor crayons that cost $16.00 a set, etc.   $100 on cork from Home Depot to cover up really messed up walls to make bulletin boards.  Prepping for the next day's lessons, and organizing the chaos from the day, etc.  You get the idea.  I am the first person at that school, every day between 6am and 6:30am and sometimes one of the last to leave.\n\nI have a very large class and the kids are FUBAR.  I teach in a Title 1 school, and for those who don't know, that means it's in a bad neighborhood and the children come from poverty and trauma.  Add the trauma of the pandemic and you have all kinds of crazy.\n\nSince the beginning of the school year, I have lost my voice every week, sobbed, got in two car accidents because of sleep deprivation, had nightmares about my classroom, migraines, and even found a grey hair.  My period, which is normally like clockwork, came two weeks early because of the stress and I'm having stomach issues.  I am worried it's an ulcer.\n\nBoth of my paychecks were late.  The first one was a week late.\n\nThere are only maybe 4 children out of over 20 who consistently are quiet, paying attention, and listen to direction the first time.  The others are doing everything under the sun.\n\nThe worst part is the violence.  I can deal with the backtalk and the lying, though it horrifies me.\n\nOne of the kids stabbed a ball with a sharp pencil and deflated it and now our class has no balls for recess.  Another told me with pride he fights adults.  Two parents have sent messages with photos to myself and the principal about things that happened to their kids at recess or in the bathroom when I am not present.  My assistant handles bathroom breaks and recess duty.  The principal handed me my ass over these incidents and took away my prep time, so now I have to be with the kids all day.  The kids still fight and shove each other.\n\nEveryone on staff is Black, and I can't tell you how much I LOVE that.  I truly had no idea how much I was missing that camaraderie and support, to have Black staff members who bring me tea for my throat or little figurines or just check in before the day starts or pop in my class for a random encouraging hug.  I love us.\n\nBut the principal is White and she's a raging narcissist and a White savior liberal racist.  Nothing I do is right and she makes impossible demands and doesn't respond to multiple requests for support or training.\n\nI put in my two weeks notice this week after she spoke to me in a disparaging way in front of staff and the kids.  She never notices the good things I'm doing.  I know I've gone above and beyond expectations.  Veteran teachers have told me so.  And if 3 teachers have already quit so far, there's something wrong with leadership, not just the kids.\n\nIt's truly sad that I'm going to make more money as a substitute teacher.\n\nIt's killing me that I will be leaving my kids behind and I know that will traumatize them, but after I put in my notice, I felt like an elephant got off my chest.\n\nDid any of you attend a school like that?  How did you turn out?\n\nAny words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated.  I really feel defeated.  I wanted to teach in this school because I wanted to do something for my people but I am in the \"protect my peace\" phase of my life journey and my life has been anything but peaceful since August.  I had no idea this school was like this when I accepted the job and signed my contract.\n\nI'm going where I will be respected, appreciated, and paid.",

This is a black day for women’s rights, and for all human rights,” said Neuer.",
