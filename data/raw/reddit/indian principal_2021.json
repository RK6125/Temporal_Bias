    "text": "Apparently I’m a woke, cancel culture, white supremacist who is attempting to subvert children’s education because of my beliefs.. Or so a mom and dad told me today because I said that I don’t feel comfortable having my kindergartners wear pilgrim and “Indian” headdresses for our Thanksgiving class feast. \n\nNow I consistently said Native American but they were adamant that they were Indians. We were having a normal parent/teacher conference and I had to get my principal to come in because they were so heated and the dad kept leaning over the table closer and closer to where I was sitting while raising his voice and demanding to know what else I am going to cancel this year. \n\nProbably didn’t help that it was obvious that my principal was trying hard not to laugh or roll his eyes when the mom went off on him because he told her “history is written by the winner” and that I have no responsibility to teach pilgrims/Native Americans and Thanksgiving because it’s not in the curriculum. Thank god for him having my back because I was ready to lose my crap when the parents both said they think I’m going to treat their child badly because of what they said. Uh, your child is six and not an entitled, butt-hurt jerk who freaks out when she doesn’t get her way, so no worries, I’ll love her like I always have because with parents like you, she’s gonna need as many kind, compassionate people in her life as she can get. \n\nNineteen years I’ve been teaching and this is the most insanity I’ve ever had to deal with. What is wrong with people?!?",

    "text": "We need to be angry about residential schools in Canada. To my Canadian teachers, principals and admin, I know you're tired. But I have to say this here, because it matters. \n\nToday, the information about the discovery of a collection of 751 unmarked graves on the grounds of the former \"Marieval Indian Residential School\" was announced in Canadian news publications. (1) Though it is still unclear whether all the graves belong to children, there are oral stories from Cowessess First Nation which tell that both children and adults are buried there. (1) This occurrence follows closely behind the horrific discovery of  the 215 unmarked childrens' graves on the grounds of the former Kamloops residential school last month. (2)\n\nThough my heart heaves with grief for the stolen lives of those lost and the lives of those unborn still, I am further enraged to bear witness to the lack of discussion and action from my superiors at work. Can we all just wake up and witness this horror? Can we take a moment to marinade and steep in this reality? \n\nThis is the legacy of Canadian education. There is not enough fresh water in Canada to clean this gaping, festering wound in our history. To my Canadian teachers, principals, and school administration, I implore you to be enraged at this news. I implore you to abandon the sterility and detachedness with which we try to have these conversations among ourselves and our students. \n\nAs leaders in our communities it is our duty to support, lift up, and stand by our First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities during this time of immeasurable grief and mourning. \n\n\\#EveryChildMatters \n\n(1) [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/cowessess-marieval-indian-residential-school-news-1.6078375](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/cowessess-marieval-indian-residential-school-news-1.6078375)\n\n(2) [https://www.canada.ca/en/crown-indigenous-relations-northern-affairs/news/2021/05/statement-on-the-discovery-around-kamloops-indian-residential-school.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/crown-indigenous-relations-northern-affairs/news/2021/05/statement-on-the-discovery-around-kamloops-indian-residential-school.html)",

The whole time she coughed and vaped for the 4 hour drive. She is an outspoken anti masker.\n\nI just found out that I now have covid.  Not only me, but her covid denying teachers assistant also has covid.\n\nWe are told not to tell anyone so as not to cause a panic.  I'm still expected to do my lesson planning and attendance for the principal, but only 3 students are showing up for class.  The rest are sick. \n\nBut we can't tell the parents that we have covid because it might cause the school to shut down. Just for reference, this isn't a public school,  but a First Nation's (Indian) school.\n\nWhat do you think, am I crazy to think this is not being responsible humans by not telling parents their kids might have been exposed to covid?",

    "text": "Rant! Should I quit? I work in a non public First Nation (Indian) school in Canada.  It has some great perks (class sizes under 10, etc), but I feel I'm being treated with so much disrespect I feel like quitting.\n\nThe educational director decided we needed a \"team building\" weekend in two weeks.   Weekend at a resort, free spa treatments.   Very nice.\n\nBut we are carpooling.  (It is 4 hours away) One member of my carpool told the rest of us that she is in charge.  She will drive, decide when we leave, where we eat, when we return.  This teacher is personal friends with the principal (but refuses to associate with the rest of the teachers).\n\nI sent a brief email to the education director asking if the person who is the self appointed driver can make up all these rules.  Maybe I should have asked the principal, but the Ed director is organizing it and I know the principal would side with his friend.\n\nThe Ed director emailed me back saying that no one person can be in charge and we need to discuss this.   Within the hour, the principal comes to my room and starts yelling at me that I was unprofessional to ask the Ed director questions when he is my boss.  I proceeded to ask him how to proceed with the teacher that insist she makes the rules.\n\nHis response \"you don't get to make choices.  We make choices where you will eat and what you will do.   You don't get to choose McDonald's \"  (I am a 6 ft, 300 lbs guy).\n\nAm I right to be SUPER annoyed at this?  Like feeling i want to quit?  There are hundreds of teaching jobs, why should I work for someone who wants to insult and yell at his staff?\n\nEDIT:  so my principal dropped in and observed my class unofficially yesterday.  We were doing a Lumio review (if you know what that is) when one of the kids turned to the principal and started talking about what they were learning (how the government t had banned the Potlatch).  Great I thought, engaging with the material.\n\nNot according to the principal.   I arrive today to have a written warning that my classroom management skills need to be improved because a student talked during a lesson and I didn't correct him.",

    "text": "Moving On I’m not 100% what I am trying to accomplish with this post, but I feel like I am rocking a middle ground between “teaching is hell and I need out” and “this is my calling I will never leave”. So here is my nugget on why I’m leaving the field. \n\nTldr- I resigned so that I could focus on my grad program. I have a lot of feelings, but generally speaking I don’t regret being a teacher and I don’t regret leaving. It’s just what is best for me. \n\n\nI’m 27 and this year was supposed to be my 8th year teaching. I pulled that off with a combination of luck, dual credit shenanigans, and sheer goddamned willpower. When I was 14 I decided I wanted to be a teacher and there wasn’t ANYTHING that could stop me. I got my four year degree, Indiana teaching license, and my first position in secondary education before my 21st birthday. I loved it. I STILL love it. Being in the classroom with young adults is a truly magical thing and I’ve gotten to work with every grade level from 7-12. I’ve gotten to teach almost every subject within my content area. I’ve worked at schools with less than 60 students in a graduation class and some with almost 600. I’ve done a fully online charter and brick and mortar. (I guess you can throw in hybrid because of COVID, but I don’t really count that).  Through all of these experiences I can genuinely honestly say that I love teaching. I can also say that I hate being a teacher. \n\nThe communities in southern Indians expect you to be a Swiss Army knife for their kids. I am a paragon who is punished for doing the slightest thing that is perceived as “wrong”. The scrutiny is unending and we are the first ones blamed for basically EVERYTHING. Scroll through the subreddit and pick an example. I’ve lived most of it. I’ve been stabbed by a student, literally spit on by a parent, and screamed at by the principal in front of all the faculty (ironically it was for working with a student outside of contract hours). I still love teaching, but by all the gods that mankind has ever worshipped, I hate being a teacher. \n\nThe toll that this profession has taken on ME cannot be sustained, but I ONCE thrived on it. I genuinely think that teaching is best described as a lifestyle. It is one I used to enjoy, but I know long feel like I have the time for it. Being a teacher has so profoundly changed my life. Almost exclusively for the better, but I realized that if I didn’t leave it would start to change me for the worse. I am leaving now because it is the right thing for me to do, but I am not leaving with any I’ll will. I am leaving knowing that I did good things, but that I do not have anything left to give. I am leaving knowing that I will take these experiences into a new profession and that I will be better for having been an educator. I wish you all well on your journeys and hope that you find peace in or out of education.",

    "text": "Growing as a Black Lady I’m not sure how to write this, but I’m about to move out of my white community that I spent the majority of my life in. I’m just beginning to see that a lot of the trauma I’ve experienced in life is from racist white people and systematic racism, and I’m  done. I think I just need to rant therapeutically.\n\nMy black parents moved to my area in the 1980s to escape the crack epidemic in the city before I was born. They were very “old school” to say the least. They tried to enroll my sisters in the local Catholic school, and the nun interviewing them asked them “Do you live in *insert only poor predominately black community in three counties here*?”\n\nThey weren’t sure what microaggression the nun was insinuating, but it rubbed them the wrong way. Around town one of the neighbors told my parents the local public school was actually the better option academically. So that’s where my sisters were enrolled. My middle sister actually made out decently, but my oldest sister had a hard time. My middle sister was actually crowned *Miss _*insert town here*” and almost went to the state beauty pageant. Never seen before or after in my town. They were both harassed by the school bus driver (who, years later saw the error of his ways and made sure I wasn’t harassed on his route). The school principal and teachers made a point of humiliating my oldest sister. When my sister brought it up to my parents, my parents said “well it’s not like they’re turning the hoses on you. Deal with it.” In their old-school mentality. My oldest sister is still in a cocktail of psych meds today from the abuse she received going through this school, including sexual assault. \n\nMe? Where to begin with me? I was the youngest in my entire grade and the only black child at a new school. The first teacher I ever had in elementary school husband was a reknown bigot in town, and said teacher tried her best to make sure I was held back. She never gave me any attention in class. Funny, to go to the next grade level I had to be tested (the deal my parents worked out with the school). The results came back that although I was the youngest in the grade-level, I was academically a whole year ahead of my classmates with just the equivalent of being at best ignored or regularly bullied each day. The way my parents tell it if it wasn’t for the teacher’s union the administration and Board of Ed would have fired her on the spot.\n\nUp until 8th grade it was pretty uneventful on the social front, I was still emotionally immature, but had a small group of girlfriends. Academically I was still ahead of most of my peers, but each year the bullying by the teachers became more and more intense. Could it be an emotionally younger student is an easier target? Sure, but looking back I think the teachers were looking for low-hanging fruit. Starting in 5th grade, I remember a teacher who liked to bully low-hanging fruit take me aside after another clique tattled on me and said meanly “there’s something wrong with you”. That stuck with me until I started anti-depressants a year ago and was my universal truth. \n\nEnter the guidance counselor. The middle school guidance counselor automatically had me slated as a “bad kid”. I was having a middle school girl fight with one of my girlfriends (truly over something petty). Looking back, I was probably beginning to experience symptoms of childhood depression around age 10 or 11. The middle-school guidance counselor threatened to call the police on me if I upset one of my girlfriends again. She found any excuse to drag me into the principals office (who was a level-headed man, he would just shoo me away within two minutes). 8th grade, there was a switch and my classmates became blatantly racist towards me. No one defended me. We had a new principal 8th grade and he enabled the bullies towards me. Looking back, I was not only depressed, but had begun to exhibit some symptoms of OCD. I had my first panic attack over these bigoted bullies when I was 13. I never told my parents as I was completely shut down and silent at home.\n\nEnter high school, long story short... more of the same. I was not accepted by my white peers, and the few other black kids at the school did not accept me because I was not “black enough”. During these awkward years I was pushed out of the closet as an lgbtq student. So, it truly felt like “we can’t dislike her because she’s black, but we can dislike her for being bisexual”. I was basically the school pariah. Did I mention when the white students came out of the closet they were elevated to popular levels? Some students were openly racist. Once again due to depression I was shut down and nothing was done about it. My OCD, Panic Disorder, and depression was severe in high school. My OCD came up in untraditional ways than cleaning and hand washing; rather I had scrupulosity, limerace, disordered eating, compulsive exercising, sexual OCD, verbally repeating words/sentences, thought cycling, maladaptive daydreaming, and excoriation disorder. Do you want to know what an obsession feels like? Imagine having intrusive, anxiety provoking thoughts on an topic ALWAYS. Sometimes it’s something average about work or school. Sometimes they are grossly inappropriate like socially-unacceptable sexual thoughts. Or anything in-between. Always. When you wake up, when you go to bed, during the SATs and GREs, at your grandma’s funeral. Always! You cannot turn that off. People don’t understand.\n\nWanna know what a compulsion feels like? You know that feeling when your having sex and you’re about to cum? That’s what the build up feels like. When you orgasm, that’s what engaging in the compulsion feels like. So, every time I engaged in religious rituals (my family was Catholic so it was hella easy for this aspect of my OCD to fly under the radar for a while), that I HAD to do or I was damned to hell, this is what it felt like. If I didn’t engage in a religious ritual, it was panic attack inducing.  That’s just ONE aspect of my compulsive nature. As an adult, I stay away from all organized religion. I’m very happy with this decision.\n\nThis was in the early 2000s. Even in my awkward teenage years I was intelligent, I knew something was “wrong”, but when I approached “safe” adults to say something was up I was told I was “looking for attention”. I tried to see my high school guidance counselor, but it became clear that she may have thought she could start an inappropriate relationship with me. She laughed off my concerns and enabled rumors that we were dating. When it got scary, I mustered up the little strength I could and told her to F off and never talk to me again. I was still shut down at home so my parents didn’t know what was going on. They also knew something was “wrong”, but instead of helping me get the help I need, they just screamed at me to “be normal” until a panic attack was induced. My parents would once again say “there’s something wrong with you.”\n\nStarting in college, at a PWI, I finally began healing and I was accepted for who I was. I went to therapy regularly and I truly bloomed.  \nI was still bullied by mean racist girls, but I had a circle of friends who would shut them down because it was the right thing. For the first time, my college had a multi-cultural club, and I had black girlfriends and I began to learn what it meant to be a black lady!\n\n\nThroughout my travels in life, I have consistently been rejected because I was either black or not black enough. I’m an educated woman with a successful career. I’m finally moving out of my racist white county. Is it weird that this is bitter sweet? Its gotten more obviously racist over the years. Trump flags are still up. Blue Lives Matter people are silent over the Jan 6 attacks, but the area is truly beautiful. If things were different I wish I could raise a family there. The cherry on top of everything is when another black family moved into town from a predominantly black area. As a good neighbor I went to say hello, excited to have someone else in town who looked like me. The family was very cold me to with the common look I get from some other black people of “not black enough”. \n\nThere are some very good people in this town. This may sound controversial, but a LOT of town cops and local state troopers made public statements during the BLM protests that “Black Lives Matter” over and over again. They marched with BLM, and were uncomfortable at Blue Lives Matter rallies. The whole community is taking steps to embrace inclusiveness and diversity. They are finally having real conversations. \n\nOne of the few things that came out of COVID-19 is that I started anti-depressants. My “old school” black parents were and still are highly embarrassed I attend therapy sessions, and told me my whole childhood that “only people in crisis go to therapy; only people with something wrong with them go on psych meds”. My life became clear and I found the strength to just leave. I realized how severe my Panic Disorder once when I began to take a PRN med for them every week and a half or so. That didn’t count the panic attacks I had behind a closed door at work or simple panic attacks that didn’t warrant a PRN. Since I was 13, I’ve been averaging 2-3 panic attacks a WEEK. I’m in my 30s... My therapist and my primary collaborated to add an additional medication last month, and for the first time ever the OCD symptoms, which have been notably decreasing since a year ago, (heads up they’ve always gone down little by little since talk therapy) went down significantly in the past month. It was like before I could only walk a mile, and out of nowhere I could run a marathon. I still have work to do in that area, but I count my blessings. \n\nHowever, the bigots are getting louder and louder. If you have guessed where I’m from yet, a local politician recently gutted a local anti-hate bill to only list BLM and Antifa as hard groups (if I understood the controversy correctly). A part of me wants to stay and fight for the town I love, but I think this just may be some sunk-cost fallacy. There are maybe four people in my town who I’m going to keep in touch with. This place is not good for my mental health, which is an ongoing project to heal. The area I’m moving to is far more diverse, mix of black, white, and Hispanic. The community over is predominately Indian, black, and Hispanic. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I fit in in my new community. Where I don’t stand out like a sore thumb just for having more melanin to white people; where I’m not teased for speaking the King’s English to other Black people. I love that feeling.\n\nWhat should I do next? I like what I do at work, but I think it’s time to take the next step in my career... also, I hate being one of the only black people as high up as I am in the company (1st world problems, I know)... I really want to find a company that is more diverse. Should I join the NAACP? Links? Or should I just be me and know I’m exactly where I should be in life?\n\nI don’t know... I’ve never been around a large group of black women in my life (the group of black girlfriends I had, though healthy and fabulous, was small). Have any of you ever experienced any of this? What do you recommend the next steps be as a strong black woman on my life journey?",
