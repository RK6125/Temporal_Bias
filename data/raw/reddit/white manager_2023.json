    "text": "Reasons why this job market is horrible. 1. **Skeleton Crews.** Basically, if one person is doing the work of three people with the same pay why hire more?  Who cares if that person is stressed out? Business is still running as usual and will hold out as long as they can. By not hiring more and keeping the headcount low, profit goes up and whoever is in the upper management gets a nice bonus.\n2. **False Hiring and PPP Loans.** Ranging from small businesses to large corporations, many have received Payment Protection Program (PPP) Loans that were supposed to be used for payroll and other expenses during the pandemic. However, many of the loans were abused and pocketed by owners and then later forgiven. A condition for these loans to be forgiven is if a company is \"actively\" trying to hire but cannot fulfill these positions. That's why people are struggling to get interviews as well as seeing jobs being posted over and over again. They had no intention to hire in the first place. Basically, it was a huge money transfer and the top ate well.\n3. **Everyone is hiring.** No, they are not. Only retail and fast food positions that barely pay a living wage and high stressed are only hiring is what they mean. Not the comfy white-collar jobs with good benefits cause who would give that up? Even then, these places are running on skeleton crews as well.\n4. **Mass Layoffs.** You have now a lot of people including whom have more than 12+ years of experience looking for jobs now. A good chunk of them are willing to take lower-paying jobs because they have no choice but to put food on the table and pay bills. Now the entry-level or junior-level position you are applying for has become more competitive. Employers have the luxury to be picky and want a unicorn to be a yes man, a bootlicker, someone who does not talk back, who is overqualified, and willing to take a pay cut as well. Also, a lot of these companies have a \"monkey see monkey do\" mentality. Once a couple of companies started doing layoffs, then other companies started doing it only because \"it must be the right thing to do right now\"\n5. **The Feds actually want unemployment to go up.** They want it to go up because the justification is that no job = no money = reduction in savings = lower purchasing power = reduction in inflation. Higher interest rates would lead more people to hold off on purchases they do not need which put less money in circulation and bring down inflation according to the federal government. Also, Powell said it is to \"discipline labor\" as well. But of course, there isn't a problem with corporations making record profits during high periods of inflation. It is estimated that 70% of inflation came from price gouging in which corporations raised the price more than they needed to and mask it as inflation. Anything but to tax the rich right? I'm sure trickle-down will happen anytime soon.\n6. **Anti- WFH Propaganda.** Throughout the pandemic, multiple reports proved that WFH has increased productivity and worker well-being that has not been seen pre-pandemic. WFH was positively received. But all of a sudden Return-to-Office was necessary as WFH wasn't working even though as long you have a computer, desk, and WI-FI, the same work that can be done at the office, can be done better from home in most people's cases. This is later revealed that a lot of bigger players are tied up in real-estate investment of these corporate buildings and that tax revenue around the surrounding areas has decreased as well which the local government does not like.  If you WFH, there is no need to buy food on the way to work or buy expensive lunch downtown, and then waste money on gas. However, with the big RTO push, a lot of employees are either resigning or outright refusing because why would you go backward on quality of life?  I even was disqualified from an interview for asking about remote policy but it is what it is. Remote work is in hot demand yet employers refuse to acknowledge it.\n\nThere's more to why the job market is trash right now of course but this is JMO from all the reports and posts I have been reading. Feel free to add or even counter any of the points I made. Any comments are appreciated",

    "text": "Just got my first 6 figure job offer! Just wanted to share with someone Hi everyone! I don't have too many people I can talk about this with, so I just wanted to share the news with someone. I work in software, and my current pay is $75k per year. The short version of my past few years is that I dropped out of college and have been making $45k/ year for a while pre-COVID. From there, 2020 hit me really hard. I was unemployed for about 6 months. I was looking for $18/hour jobs, then I got an opportunity in software sales. I started at a base salary of $50k per year. I got promoted once and then moved over to operations within my company, and my salary went up to $75k (where it is now).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving been at my current company for 3 years, I've known that I was underpaid compared to the market for a while, so I started looking a few months ago. I applied to this job that's a manager-level position, which is one level above my current role. I had my final round interview at this company last week and it went pretty well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe hiring manager set some time with me yesterday afternoon. When we hopped on the call, we talked for a few minutes before she offered me the job! $120k per year! In the moment, I didn't react much outwardly or inwardly beyond being pleasant and expressing thankfulness and excitement about the offer. I was trying to keep my hand close to my vest I suppose. I ended up thanking her and agreeing to follow up on Monday after I had the weekend to think about it (as I was in the process of a few other interviews as well). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the hour after we hopped off Zoom, I didn't feel much. Then the offer letter hit my inbox. Seeing $120,000 in black and white is when it hit me. $10,000/month. I broke down and started crying. That's more money than I've ever made before by a long shot. I wanted to call my dad and tell him because I know that he'd be proud. He died in 2020, so I got hit with a wave of emotions from excitement to relief, to grief hitting me super hard. I've had a lot of money stress over the past few years, and this feels like a game changer. I'm hoping that this will accelerate my ability to build up savings and I want to be smart with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that's my ramble. Thanks for listening. Today I'm excited and am looking forward to accepting on Monday. I still wish I could call my dad up and tell him though; I know he'd be happy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: wow, I appreciate all the love! The positivity is really great to see.",

The drink coolers are full of mold and I also had been out for about a month because of surgery and recovery. My manager harassed me every week asking when I was returning. She said she “wasn’t” aware I submitted FMLA (Family medical leave act) but when I resubmitted it she got an email and questioned me about it? She’s narcissistic and loves to throw things in your face. I let her know I may be calling off work more often due to my surgery and the unpredictability of when I’m not feeling well. Last week I got so sick to the point I was throwing up and she had the nerve to tell me not to call off because she has plans. After I quit she kept saying I ruined her plans and not once during my recovery did she even check on me to see if I was ok. I stayed longer than I should have. I filed a complaint against her and I’m encouraging my coworker to do the same since she’s made racist remarks towards him (he’s black, shes white)",

    "text": "Horrible interview yesterday that makes me realize companies are mislabeling jobs & leaving out massive requirements so they can wildly underpay, not to mention refuse to train. I interviewed for a \"coordinator\" role in a company in a major city yesterday that was very generic about data stewardship. I've done this in a similar company before - I'll admit, it's mostly data entry, electronic record keeping, research, administrative work within existing records, using ERP correctly. Stuff I have experience in. \n\n...*Every interview*, including this one, has become a horrible game of trick questions where the interviewer conceals the actual skill level required. Nothing about training. Extraordinary discrepancies between job description and specific requirements, like expert level Excel. \n\nSometimes they overshoot what is actually required. They go out of their way not only to give the impression there will be *no training within the job* to do the job, use the software, do the tasks they need a qualified candidate to do - I realized in this case the interviewer had lied about the actual responsibilities of the job. \n\nHe started asking me what I know about VBA, querying large data sets in Excel (if you guys have notes, I would be grateful - I've never done Power Query before, only basic functions, up to something like offset/match, tables.)\n\nIt's very hard to get that training, it seems, unless your fresh out of college - after internships. I only have a little as a contractor, and I was on my own, mostly, using what I've picked up in Excel workshops.\n\nWhen I pointed out it seems they're look for a sales analyst, the interviewer argued with me and said it was a different job. \n\n*This is the second time this has happened*, the second job, where I apply to my former job title...and find I have to talk about writing fucking Excel macros. Have to desperately, flabbergastedly talk about tutorials I've taken on querying large data sets with SQL. \n\nThis is for a job in a major American city that requires at least 3 days onsite and starts at $43k. It's not even the decline in pay...its the skills expectation for that salary and the horrible experience of being made to feel like I did something wrong when I just applied to an \"entry level\" opening that seemed to match my background. \n\nNo reporters are talking about this trend (not just my job search-shouldn't have to clarify that), but I don't think it's just me....it seems like there's a requirements/pay mismatch across more than a few white collar industries that got worse sometime in 2023, and I don't think I would believe this if I weren't going through it. NYT did a couple of articles on the Great Resignation....this seems comparable or like a reversal.\n\nIt's been a year of searching in a market that's gotten worse....last year was bad, this year is like a Twilight Zone nightmare of people asking for senior sales analysts under \"administrative assistant\" jobs. \n\nAnd that doesn't cover the jobs in tech where my interviews are 25 year old managers with theater/fashion degrees somehow working as financial managers who just...don't want to work with someone older than they are. \n\nEvery five years the job market gets worse and worse, and the skills requirements skyrocket. \n\nThat's a frightening prospect if you are in your 20s and coming into the job market for the first time, but if you are lifelong underemployed, like me, and have a shitty resume (a few years of  experience, but all for contract projects, or in dead end office jobs in horrible companies)...I'm at my wit's end. The stigma never really goes away barring something extraordinary, like a Master's degree...and even then, it's hopeless unless someone just...gives you a chance.\n\nNote, the only reason I applied to this job was because the job description actually seemed to match my background, or general enough I could have hope. Hiring for my previous job title and its actual duties has disappeared.\n\nI'm seeing jobs for sales analysts that want Salesforce certifications, 3 years of managing a companies' \"business processes\", Masters' etc. that start at $60k and tap out at $75k. \n\nIts really fucking bad out there, and not only am I afraid seeing salaries shrink while skill requirements for \"entry level\" jobs explode...I've never actually been trained in a single job I've ever done. Not really. Not to stay in a job, only as a contractor, and of course, that's short-lived and can't truly be practiced and built upon within that role. \n\nI've never enjoyed the normal experience of being taken on, trained, kept, and promoted because I didn't intern and came into the job market after I wasted a lot of time in grad school. It wasn't for lack of desire or work in those jobs. \n\n...And thus, even if I can work towards certifications, take Coursera courses, take tutorials by myself...none of really matters. It's all done alone, and it's not \"demonstrable experience\". It's unpaid labor with precious little direction to get to the first interview stage with people who treat my resume like a wad of used toilet paper anyway.\n\nSo much of what I'm seeing in job listings now points to a level of training you can't even do on your own without paying for a software license. Over and over. \n\nIs anyone else experiencing this or seeing this?",

    "text": "Company won't hire any minorities I am a white male who is an upper-middle manager at a regionally successful business in the Pacific Northwest (300+ employees on the payroll). After getting a graduate degree (combined with some Covid layoffs), I have been making strides at work and have received two promotions in the last four years. Approximately two weeks ago I got invited to be a member of a resume review board for selecting new interns and employees. This is the first time I have been a member of such a board.\n\nThings were pretty banal and repetitive at first until we arrived to a frankly over-qualified candidate who was African American. I voted that we bring this guy on but the other people I was on the board with disagreed. They said that they couldn't bring in any more African American employees until more diversity coordinators for the company were hired. I asked what the hell that had to do with anything and they said they didn't want to open up the company to \"liability for any lawsuits\" so they had to acquire more diversity resources before they could hire any minority candidates. The head of the board also stated that this directive came from the Owner/CEO. Completely disgusted, I stormed out of the meeting.\n\nThe head of HR was also a member of this meeting so I have no real avenue for filing a complaint other than via the Oregon BOLI. I have been completely socially isolated at work since this incident and anticipate I am on the verge of being fired. What do I do in this situation??",

    "text": "Anyone else demoralized by article after article saying there is no recession? I was laid off by a manager that treated me like an animal/an alien every time he was in my office, communicated to my coworkers he thought my job (that is, I) was stupid/useless/worthless. I should have documented it. I never received a bad performance review or complaints about m relationship with coworkers. \n\n For the purposes of plausible deniability, he waited until cyclical layoffs.  (There are other reasons in his behavior I knew this was personal; in an office of 10, I got on his bad side when I asked for a 2% raise, and I am not STEM, but I worked as admin in a STEM setting....I realize I'm not sweating the \"hard stuff\", but I actually did a job for sales purposes. Someone has to keep clean records/interact w/customers.) There was no warning; I think it goes without saying I would have accepted, \"no raise\". He lied to my face about moving forward. My performance reviews were solid. I was busy and the team I supported was busy. \n\nThere rumors specific to this company about inventory...it gave me no comfort though.\n\nI googled for some insight, since it appears from this sub this is a time of year companies lay people off and complaints for the last year of a recession to come\", just assessing this sub's recent posts for the last few months....\n\nThis is all I can find. Newspaper for newspaper, article for article. I know it's re-election season but it still - what it indicates is that anyone getting laid off now is unusual. \n\n https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/business/economy/economy-soft-landing.html\n\nI searched, \"recession August 2023\" and apparently its been decided there is no recession and won't be. \n\nMakes me feel like a piece of shit. \n\nI guess this is like the Great Resignation, about all those service workers that didn't lose their jobs forever, the just got great white collar jobs, realizing they didn't have to \"settle\" anymore. If you're not working a STEM, skilled trade, finance or medical job in America, you must deserve w/e is happening to you. Shareholders & board room members are the only participants in the economy.\n\nI should add that the staffing agency that brought me to these people relisted my role with a single word changed in the title (no listing of the company). The salary is the same. In other words, I was lied to. I am adding that context re: context because naturally I know layoffs happen even when unemployment is low and venting as well.",

    "text": "How to get a 100k income by end of the year...serious \\*\\*Please note, I am only trying to help. I see so many struggling and the light is right there\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see this daily. It works. Its true, and its life changing. Do these steps...  \n\n\n1. Go get a cup of coffee or soda and sit by yourself and stare into the distance. Start thinking about all of the things in life (products and services) that you actually care about. Solar, coffee, construction, the little rubber things at the end of the pencil....dude, anything.\n2. After you get your top 3, go home on indeed and type \\[insert idea\\] sales.\n3. Apply to any and all. In sales, the company's name on your shirt really doesn't matter. I'll explain later.\n4. You WILL get an interview rather quickly, hiring sales managers will take on anyone, you have no idea who can be a good sales rep. I BARELY look at resumes, or your history. The things you say on the phone are MUCH more important.\n5. On that interview, (sales in general is very casual compared to the rest of the white collar positions) so be yourself. The 3 things ANY sales manager wants to hear is A), \"I am trainable,\" meaning you want to learn more about the product/service. B) You are energetic on the phone, they don't want to see the happiest person alive, but don't give a soft \"yea\" answer, slightly expand on it. and c) You want to learn how to be a better salesman (meaning you are showing that you want to learn how to be a salesman, while acknowledging that you are entry level\n\nEVERYONE that I know that I have hired or has taken my advice to go into sales on any level has said, \"I don't think I'll be good at sales,\" or \"I don't want to be in sales and interact with others.\" What they don't know is that if you REALLY like the product or service, its not work and you're just standing around talking about things you love with other people who love it as well. Most sale jobs are order taking, meaning you are not really hunting down new business as much as you think, depending on the product or service, most will come to you, you just need to try to upsell. Finally, if you actually do love the product/service, then it will be a LOT easier than you think.  \n\n\nI do not know anyone in sales that makes less than 80-100k a year (on the lower end), working from home, 20ish hours a week. I have 12 or so people (I can show numbers as proof) that now have life changing money just because they applied. They went from a $15 worker to multiple 6 figures.  I hate people, I consider myself an introvert, and I refuse to go into an office. Strictly work out of my house.\n\nIf you live in the Northeast, I can give you 25 companies of different services that will hire you right now.  \n\n\nSide Note: No matter what, DONT go into sales management. I mean, I did and I kind of regret it. We don't get paid as much and there is a LOT more stress, sales is probably the only career where I would recommend NOT getting promotions. Take a Senior Sales title and call it a day. I have a nice salary, but it doesn't make up for having to come in everyday, always be on call, etc.",

    "text": "Fired for the first time in my life As the title says, I was recently fired from my Job (November 30th).  It was for a stupid reason, but it is essentially preventing me from getting unemployment.  It's currently in adjudication.  I'm basically at the swan song part of my working life, I'm am 59 1/2 years old.  Since I can no longer do the kind of work that I spent the majority of my life doing, I am relegated to no experience labor type jobs.\n\nBeing the age that I am with relatively no lengthy work experience in these no experience labor type jobs has made finding work a real challenge.  Now that I have been fired, I'm stuck trying to explain why I was terminated.  I'm finding my age, the fact that I don't have related work experience, and being recently fired a major hurdle to overcome.  It also doesn't help that I am a woman, people just see me as some old lady, not a potential applicant when I show up for an interview.\n\nI've worked my entire life, never once been fired, just have a skillset that I can no longer work in, and quite frankly, haven't done for the past 10 years anyways.  Did a job at a highly specialized manufacturing place that doesn't translate out of that sort of work.  It was at a high density micro flex manufacturing company, there are only but a handful in the US that do that sort of work.  My last place of employment was at a Amazon warehouse, so now you understand the stupid reason for termination.\n\nI'd like to continue working in some form of manufacturing or warehousing work but lack the work history to apply for anything but no experience.  If I do get an interview, they are taken aback by my age and immediately see me as their grandmother or something.  I also just don't know how to talk about being fired.  In my opinion it wasn't something worthy of a termination, but it's their company, they can fire at-will employees for just about anything.\n\nAny advice on how to get a entry level job in a field that is clearly dominated by men when all you really have is the ability to learn, work hard, and be 100% dependable?  Trying to break that glass ceiling.  Any older female workers out there been in the same boat?  I like working in a labor intensive fast-paced work environment, it makes the day go by faster.  Amazon gave me that.  I've applied to a truck manufacturing job that claims they will train you and no experience required, but fear as soon as they see me, they will assume I am not going to be up for the job.  I can't really blame them, very few women seek out this sort of work at my age.\n\nEDIT:  \n\nI'm so glad I made this post, you all have been very helpful and have picked up my spirits.  The reason I am looking for a labor type role is because I can't sit for long periods of time without developing swelling in the legs, feet, and ankles.  I have lymphedema.  I manage it best by being on the move all day, desk jobs are not a fit for me with this condition, even with compression stockings.  Never had a flair up while working at Amazon.  Every desk job I have ever had has always caused a flair up over time.\n\nMy termination from Amazon was a category 1 safety infraction.  I appealed the termination, but Amazon is not known for overturning such dismissals.  It was a minor incident, no one was injured, no damage to equipment, just let go of a stow cart as I was moving it out of one of my aisles.  No risk to anyone as no one was in the area at the time.  Amazon is pretty black and white about their safety infractions, so they are all treated like someone could have been injured et al.  No gray area.  They don't make it a point to tell their employees what they consider termination offenses, they just call them category 1 offenses.  You basically find out, after the fact.  It's this termination that is causing hiccups with my unemployment claim and my future ability to work at a place that highly values safety in the workplace.  They may not consider it a minor incident any more than Amazon.\n\nA little history of the types of jobs I have done:\n\nWorked at a bicycle manufacturing company where I worked on a moving line attaching components and routing brake cables, among other things.\n\nWorked at a high-density micro flex printed circuit board manufacturing company.  Worked in their imaging department laminating substrate and silk screening solder mask, printed customer designs via laser direct imaging and processed them through a developer bath.  Went on to do the CAM department where I prepared customer files for manufacturing and created laser and CNC files for manufacturing.  Highly specialized work, really only a handful of companies in the entire US that do that sort of work.\n\nWorked in the aerospace industry as a computer-based training multimedia developer.  Worked with engineering models and data to create 3D animations and graphics for their courseware. Worked on both military and commercial training and held a top secret clearance while in that role.\n\nWorked at an Amazon delivery station processing packages for customer delivery.  Worked on both their automated and manual belts.  Scanned and moved packages weighing up to 50 lbs into totes or onto OV racks for pick and stage.  During pick and stage, picked packages and totes from these locations based on delivery route and staged them on carts for the delivery drivers.  These were the primary work paths, also worked in haz mat, problem solve, jackpot, induct, and non-con.\n\nMy resume only reflects the flex printed circuit board company and Amazon because it is the most relevant and most recent.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "text": "Why is nobody talking about the seeming huge decreases in salaries, for the same roles? I took at offer for an admin job doing sales coordination/analytics in retail for 47% of my previous hybrid salary (both shitty). They lied to me and said there's opportunity for promotion. I am happy to do the work - it is remote, and being trained. It's fucking grueling. \n\n...The brass ring is a sales analytics job that will pay...$60k. A really shitty salary.\n\nIt's bad enough my previous job has all but disappeared...but it's that the the __ \"coordinator\" roles I am searching for now (lower salary, lower title) are literally data and sales analytics roles that expect people who know VBA, for 60k/year (I live in a city), hybrid....or very, very industry specific. To insurance; to finance (more so than before). These are all \"entry level\" roles in linkedin - they ask for 3 years of experience but its understood, every job poster looking can get 10. \n\n\nI've never felt more afraid as a jobseeker in my life. The thought of going back to school and not having an income or having to try to balance something like a finance MBA (if I get it) while working makes me want to die, but what is college in 2023? It's a doorway to jobs. I wish I'd understood that at 18.\n\nPart of the problem is that I've always been underemployed - I've never been in a job or space or able to work for a company that might, say, promote their ___ (entry level) to ( _) associate role so that I acquire \"demonstrated experience using SQL. (I know there are Coursera courses for Tableau, SQL, but how many of those do I need for a junior sales analyst job or to even get a first round interview)? \n\nEvery five years since I graduated college I've found myself at this juncture - periodically unemployed after losing a terrible job with a shit salary, no security, horrible managers that resent having to hire admin/sales support staff at all, or anyone but sales staff/senior staff; no advancement (e.g. in contract roles), lacking what feels like the new basic standard of experience for \"entry level\" jobs, too old for \"entry level roles\", too weak an interviewer, and having spent what feels like my whole life isolated from what's expected of everyone now - not just intermediate excel, but VBA, SQL, Tableau, and other softwares you can't get access to without an expensive license (the single thing that makes me appreciate Trailhead)...\n\nI feel trapped.  And in my \"jobs to aspire to\" searches...I see people clearly asking for Salesforce administrators...without asking for the exam on paper, but all the skills. So they can pay their candidates $65k a year. \n\nWho the fuck even gets these jobs, I ask myself? (I know who because I worked with them - comp sci majors who started with a company at 22, and were cultivated and nurtured by managers that kept them and trained them into experts.)\n\nIt seems like the lowest level adminstrative/sales support jobs require either a data science or comp sci degree. Or finance analytics. \n\nNo media source cares or talks about it. The whole labor market about tech and finance hemmorhagaging jobs can take its pick of those people for jobs paying $70k a year, for jobs that were promising $90k before. It's very alienating, on top of the shame/fear that has come to define the last decade for me. I am underemployed and worried about money and aging while working horrible white collar jobs that demand college degrees and a certain level of comfort with specific project management software, Excel, etc....and pay....17/hour. \n\nThat no one with a soapbox is noting this about white collar jobs, or talking about the recession that wasn't (\"Biden economy is strong\")...\n\nYeah, I don't know what to do, and I'm afraid. I took a step back and I'm afraid of how to get out of this or if I even can, financially, because it would require going back to school. How do you pay rent that way?",

    "text": "Am I stupid to still be pissed about the job I was fired from in July? To make an extremely long story short, I was fired in July for recording a video of me doing something at work that wasn't work related. I played one of our display pianos. I got fired for that. I'm still pissed off about it. Full story below. TLDR at the end.\n\nFor context, I'd been working at this job for 4, almost 5 years. I was great at it. I loved my job. I centered a lot of my life around this job because it was in my career path (music education). My new manager, after my old manager left, was a good friend of mine. We got along great. We played games when it wasn't busy, like Minecraft and her Nintendo Switch, we joked and when we had everything completed we chilled.\n\nThat is, until she started to become a corporate suck up and began metaphorically sucking our district manager's dick and randomly became super strict out of nowhere, like not using our phones during work. Even though she frequently still played games and stuff. Then, one day, she fired me. There's a lot of lead up in between, but that's how it ended. \n\nI'm not pissed because I got fired. I wasn't planning on staying at that job forever and I have a MUCH better paying job now, with a lot more freedom, and I don't have to work with customers. \n\nI'm pissed because the shit she fired me for (\"doing non work related things in the clock\") IS THE SAME SHIT SHE WAS DOING. She's a huge fucking hypocrite for talking to me like she literally didn't bring her Nintendo Switch to work to play the Legend of Zelda. All I did was record a 15 second video of me playing one of our display pianos. Which I used to do on my \"break\" all the time (spoiler alert, I frequently ran the store by myself, so yeah, I didn't get a break). She was friends with me on Snapchat and never had a problem with it, until I guess during one of her BJ sessions with our DM he must have brought it up somehow???? Idk it was totally out of the blue.\n\nApologies for the long rant, I've been bottling up my anger and frustration for months now. Why did I get fired, and not her???? She also fired my coworker who provided a PDF of the employee handbook to me after I was fired, because my family wanted to take it to court. (It never happened.)\n\nTo top it all off, the white employee (yes I'm bringing up race, both me and that coworker who was fired are black) who stayed 2 hours after we closed to fuck around on guitars WHILE ON THE CLOCK was given a temp position instead so he could \"have time to find another job.\" But we were fired randomly. No write ups. The only two black employees in the district. \n\nWhere I live, you don't need a write up or anything to get fired, but it still sucks.\n\nTLDR: I'm pissed because I got fired for the same exact shit my manager was doing.",

    "text": "Former HR assistant. My Thoughts I was hired as an HR assistant at the beginning of May and was recently fired unjustly; here are my thoughts about working at medium sized companies.\n\nThis is more of a rant and will hopefully give some insight to people who are wondering why they can’t find jobs. Some backstory of who I am, I’m a 22 year old woman who was supposed to be working an internship this summer at a medium sized company (60 people). I was fired last week and was told I wasn’t doing my job properly. As much as I don’t want to take my former boss’ statement personally, I feel like I have to just because I know for a fact that I was completing work faster and more accurately than anyone else she’s hired for this specific role. My job was to handle recruitment for the company and since I was extremely efficient at that, they also had me handle data entry for another department where the manager was not completing the work fast enough for their team. Anyway, I was let go and even after asking what I had done wrong, I got no solid answer. The boss had it against me from day 1, saying that my lack of experience was concerning for her and that they would replace me with someone more senior eventually. The only reason I was hired in the first place was because the girl below her thought I did phenomenally during my interview. To me this was fine, especially since the arrangement was only to gain experience for the summer. Regardless, I know that I was not in the wrong for anything because my boss wanted to hire her 15 year old daughter to sit in my place and pay her double than what I was making which is what ended up happening this week. \n\nMoving on. Working for a medium sized, tight knit company where a majority of the employees were related (mother, father, siblings etc) in some way gave me lots of insight on what it can be like as an outsider. Firstly, these companies do not care about your well being. They will work you to the bone and when you ask for feedback, they’ll tell you everything is fine and then get rid of you when all the major work is completed.\n\nThe racism is also a huge problem, and you can’t say anything about it. As a white female recruiter, I brought forward multiple resumes with fantastic work experience and managers would not want to conduct interviews with people who had ethnic names. And those who were anything other than white were forced to bring in government documentation to the office to prove that it was not fake. The racism was blatant, and I could not do anything about it as an intern.\n\nLastly is a point that I’m sure a lot of people on this subreddit would relate to is the issue of experience. Do you ever wonder why you can’t get calls back from employees who are hiring for entry level positions? That’s because these boomer managers who don’t have an education past highschool are the ones demanding the new generation to have at least a bachelors degree, 10 years of experience and many other qualifications for a job that pays 18$ an hour. Isn’t that rich coming from them? I find it hilarious that these people that haven’t grown out of their highschool attitudes are the one making the final decisions, just because they’ve been with the company when it first opened up.\n\nThat’s my take on this. Good luck to you all",

It's just been one shit show after another lol.\n\nI can't seem to get out of the entry level bind, and even after pinpointing my career (Project Management) gaining vast experience/certifications, working for a well respected company (as a contractor) and networking- still not getting far in life.\n\nSo honestly, I am just done. I have been collecting $ and have some side income coming in (it's not much but it helps me survive). I am thinking of putting up the white flag soon.\n\nAnyone else feel this way? Like the motivation and drive in this capitalistic society is just gone? I was 18 during the 2008 recession and saw how it upended lives within weeks.

When I started my career in my 20s we were all told to be very aggressive with contacting recruiters and managers almost to a point of nagging them. We were told that we should email them after any phone calls to thank them for considering me to be polite, but the main purpose of these emails were to \"show that we want the job\". After a week or so we were suppose to email/nag them again, to remind them that we exist so that we stick out from their pool of candidates. I don't think the phrase \"ghosting\" existed when I was in college to be honest, but if it did we were told to basically not let them ghost us.\n\n\nAnyway I am trying to change my career now so I have no contacts into my new career I want to move to. I have been applying to jobs and I mentioned to some people, and they were horrified that I would do this. They basically told me that by emailing them I am putting my name on notice, but in a bad way.",

    "text": "I am an experienced resume writer and editor, and wanted to share some pointers on how to best format your resume [PART 2] Hey r/jobs, it's me again, coming at you with all of the resume advice you could ever need, and more! I posted all of my resume tips and tricks a couple of months back, which led me to receiving an amazingly overwhelming amount of comments (THANK YOU!) and I wanted to clear up some things, and include some things I missed in my last post. I've put all of this advice in order so it's easy to find the info you need when you need it.\n\nTo introduce myself, my name is Holly, and I am an experienced resume writer and editor located in North America. Essentially, I love helping people make their resume the best it can be, and I often help out in the r/jobs discord, and a tech workers slack channel, giving free advice as often as I am able to.\n\nResume writing and editing has been a part time hobby/job for me since 2017. I work full time as a senior account manager in tech, plus I have a bunch of hobbies outside of work, so I give my time where I can, which is unfortunately not as much as it used to be. I guess that's why I've written these posts, because I can no longer help as many people as I used to, and hopefully this way it can assist hundreds or even thousands of people!\n\n***DISCLAIMER: Many of these tips are North America specific,*** ***and some/many don't apply to creative fields like designers/marketing resumes.*** *Also some of these are for people working in the corporate world and don't apply to food service or retail jobs.* ***Of course, some of these won't apply to you specifically, so use your common sense to take what is useful to you.***\n\n~\n\n# CONTACT INFORMATION AND TOP OF PAGE\n\n* **Contact details** \\- at the top when of your resume under or next to your name, you need to include the following things: your location (if you're willing to relocate to the area the job is in, put the jobs city in and not your current location) email address, and your LinkedIn profile. Phone number isn't essential, so include it or don't, it's fine. Other optional things to include - if you have a portfolio or GitHub, definitely include them. Don't paste them as a messy link, instead write \"GitHub\" and turn it into a hyperlink.\n* **Location:** Are you located in San Francisco, California, applying to jobs in your city, and/or remote? Write \"San Francisco, CA\".\n* **Location:** Are you in San Fran, but open to relocation, AT THEIR EXPENSE? Write \"San Francisco, CA (open to relocation)\".\n* **Location:** Are you in San Francisco currently, but you're willing to move **before** starting a new job to New York AT YOUR OWN EXPENSE, where your dream job is located? Or you've already planned to move to New York and you're only applying to roles there? Put your location as \"New York, NY\". Why? Because you're moving there on your own cost prior to starting work, at your own expense.  If it comes up in the interview, tell them the truth. \"This is my dream job and I'm planning to move prior to starting if I'm successful\", or \"I'm moving to New York on X-date - which is prior to the start date of this job - and everything is already organized, which is why I have my location listed as New York rather than San Francisco.\"\n   * If you want them to pay for your relocation fees, then use the (open to relocation) that I wrote above.\n* **DO NOT INCLUDE YOUR FULL ADDRESS IF YOU'RE IN NORTH AMERICA** \\- only include your City and State/Province, and use one of the above depending on your circumstances.\n* **Contact details (what not to include)** \\- don't include the word PHONE before your phone number, or EMAIL before your email address. They are not necessary. People know what a phone and email look like. You're just taking up space for no reason. Also don't include your social media accounts except for LinkedIn (unless they are professional accounts for marketing/design/media positions of course, etc.).\n* **LinkedIn link and info:** Make sure your LinkedIn profile link is customized. You can get a custom LinkedIn link from your LinkedIn profile on the right hand side at the top right, click on \"Edit public profile and URL\". Make sure your custom LI link includes your name and not just a bunch of random numbers. Be creative. Are you a John Smith and you're located in Texas? Maybe your custom link could be smith.john.tx or johnsmith.tx, or include your middle initial. Play around with it until you get the perfect LI custom link. When including your LinkedIn link on your profile, instead of including the whole URL, only include the last bit (for example, **in/johnsmith**) - and lastly, make sure you include the hyperlink on your resume so that people can click it while viewing your resume.\n* Do the same as above with GitHub or any other professional links you're including on your resume. Make it a hyperlink so you're not including some messy link that's killing the \"feng shui\" of your resume.\n* **DO NOT INCLUDE A PHOTO OF YOURSELF IF YOU'RE APPLYING TO JOBS IN NORTH AMERICA.** Companies have to prove that their hiring processes isn't based on race, gender, age, appearance, etc. Including a picture in NA can actually get your resume thrown out entirely. I know LinkedIn profiles include your profile picture, which is weird that we're just okay with this, but not with pictures on resumes, but here we are. Hey, I don't make up the rules, I merely abide by them and am here to ensure your resume is, *\\*chefs kiss\\**, perfectly formatted.\n* **Summary/Objective - to add or not to add?** I only recommend adding one if you're making a career move/change, and applying for jobs that aren't in your career ladder. The other alternative is if you've been out of your industry for a while, either studying or working in a completely different field, or if you took a break and need to explain the gap in work. I believe a summary should be no longer than 5 lines of the page maximum, which is typically around 3-4 sentences. You don't need a summary if you're looking for jobs on your current career ladder and don't have any gaps on your resume.\n\n# HOW TO ORGANIZE YOUR RESUME (IN ORDER)\n\n* If you HAVE had relevant experience since your education, then put your professional experience first. DO NOT INCLUDE YOUR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION (unless you're still in high school, or are looking for your first or second job out of highschool, or if you don't have university to add to it and you have less than 2 years of work experience). So it would go like:\n   * (1.) Name and contact info, LinkedIn, GitHub etc. 2. Summary/objective (if adding it) 3. Experience 4. Education & Certifications 5. Projects (if you have any you want to add, and the space to add them, or simply link to your GitHub or LinkedIn and list them there) 6. Skills 7. Volunteering - if it's going to assist with your current career, or if you have the space for it 8. Languages spoken (only add this if you speak more than one language fluently) 9. Interests (if you have the space and want to add them)\n* If you HAVEN'T had relevant experience and your education was in the past 1-3 years and it's relevant to your job, then:\n   * (1.) Name and contact info, LinkedIn, GitHub etc. 2. Summary/objective (if adding it - I do recommend it here to explain the direction you're heading) 3. Education & Certifications 4. Projects (if you have any) 5. Skills 6. Volunteering (if you have any) 7. Languages spoken (only add this if you speak more than one language fluently) 8. Interests\n* Basically, just put the best most recent and relevant info at the top that relates to the jobs you're applying to, and mark it in order from there.\n\n# ONE PAGE OR TWO?\n\nAh I love this question, people get so heated about it haha! There's a lot of variables and a lot of opinions on this, so let's get into it...\n\n* FIRST THINGS FIRST - If you're going to go to 2 pages, for the love of the flying spaghetti monster, DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT have it as less than 1.5 pages. If you're commiting to 2 pages, USE THE SECOND PAGE. Beef up some bullet points, make some of the text or the lines larger, whatever you need to do if you're absolutely convinced it will not fit on one page. Otherwise, REDUCE that bad boy to 1 page. Nothing quite grinds my gears as much as seeing an 8th of the second page being used. IT LOOKS AWFUL, REALLY REALLY AWFUL. Thanks for letting me get that off my chest.\n* Unless you're in senior management, your resume (for North American applicants anyway) should be one page ideally, two pages max if you have over 10 years of RELEVANT experience, but in saying that...\n* Do you have LESS than 10 years of university and work experience combined, and you're NOT in a high up VP/Director position? You are likely best to go with one page.\n* No education after highschool, but you've got 10 years or less of really amazing experience, but not in a higher up position? You are likely best to go with one page.\n* Do you have LESS than 10 years of university and work experience combined but you also have a few AMAZING projects you worked on separately, and you've done relevant volunteer work, and your resume is actually kind of incredible? Then hell yeah, go for 2 pages! Brag all you want and show them why they need to hire you!\n* I could go on. Just one page or two, either way, ensure you use the full page if you've got it, I hate seeing only 1.5 pages or less. Either bring it closer to 2, or bring it down to 1.\n* **\"What about 3 pages, or 4, or 5? I have so many jobs and I'm awesome and want to show them!\" In North America, NO, GET OUT OF HERE, ABSOLUTELY NOT!** They won't see it as \"Wow this person is amazing\", they will see it as \"Oh wow this person doesn't know how to write a resume, and this is way too long for me to bother to read\" and they'll delete it. In other parts of the world? Sure. I know some countries like the UK for instance that want a full CV (they are different from resumes, as they list every single job, achievement, certification, volunteer experience, and more) that are often 3+ pages long. Well, my advice isn't for UK resumes, because that's not my specialty. I'm just saying that 2 is the max for North America.\n* Need to find extra space on your resume to reduce it down to 1 or 2 pages? **Use narrow margins.**\n* **SO ONE PAGE OR TWO?** Honestly, either is fine if you're using the space efficiently, and aren't writing giant bullet points and paragraphs. ***If you're unsure, go for one page.***\n\n# GENERAL FORMATTING\n\n* **Make sure EVERYTHING is uniform**. If most of your dates are 3 letters only, like Jun 2016 - Oct 2020, then they ALL need to be the same. Yes, even the months of June and July with just one more letter. It looks much neater. Ensure you double check the spacing is correct too, for example, the most common error I see on resumes is some dates having a space and then a hyphen, and then no space before the next date (example Jan 2019 -Jun 2020 and then Jul 2020-Feb 2022, then Apr 2022 - Present) - this is a very small issue, but it shows you do not have attention to detail. Whichever format you choose for one, ensure they ALL follow the same format.\n* Double check if something is bolded, or underlined (like a title or date or company name), ensure that all the others are in the same format.\n* Is the font the same for each section? It's fine if you're using different fonts on your resume, but ensure that each section is the same. For example, if one job with all the bullet points are Times New Roman, then all jobs needs to be in Times New Roman. If one section header is Garamond, and the next section header is Times New Roman, it shows you don't have the attention to detail.\n* **Remember, your resume needs to be PERFECT. You seriously need to go through each line by line with a fine tooth comb.** Imagine not securing an interview with your dream job because of a few silly spelling mistakes or poor formatting. \"Well I didn't want that job anyway\"... yeah you did. It can be a hard pill to swallow and it's easy to make light of it, but you never know who is the one deciding on the yes or no pile and where yours will land.\n* **Ensure all line breaks are the same size**. If one blank line in between 2 paragraphs is size 7, and then the next blank line between paragraphs is size 11, it's a very noticeable detail to those looking at your resume.\n* **For your paragraphs and bullet points, use the \"justify\" align**. It removes a bit of the white space and brings your text fully to the right of the page. It's much neater and removes the jagged look of left align. The exception to this (as there usually are) is if none of your bullet points are longer than one line. I like justify align on a summary/objective if you're adding one, and on bullet points or any paragraphs that are 2 lines or longer. Play around with it and see what works best for your resume.\n* **DON'T WASTE AN ENTIRE LINE ON A HANDFUL OF WORDS!** I often see people when writing their bullet points taking up less than half a line, or only a couple of words on the 2nd or 3rd line. Not only does this create a lot of white space, but it's also selling yourself short. You have one, maybe two pages to sell the sh!t out of yourself. Make every single line of your page count. Make sure every single line of your bullet points is at least halfway across the page or more. Either beef up that bullet point, or condense it.\n* **5 bullet points max per job** (of course there are exceptions, but this is as a general rule). The older the job, the less bullet points. A job from 10 years ago will only require 1-3 bullet points (and only if it's relevant to your current career. Really think hard about whether to include it on your resume or not. Remember, all your jobs are on LinkedIn, not everything needs to go on your resume... again, North American advice).\n* **Use a different verb at the start of each bullet point.** I roll my eyes when I see the same word repeated multiple times as the first word in bullet points. Instead of just using the word managed, use words like Coordinated / Directed / Orchestrated / Oversaw / Spearheaded. There's a great article written by the Muse, you can find it here: [https://www.themuse.com/advice/185-powerful-verbs-that-will-make-your-resume-awesome](https://www.themuse.com/advice/185-powerful-verbs-that-will-make-your-resume-awesome). If you work in a field with specific wording, like Nursing for example, then google \"Nursing resume verbs\" or something like that. Put the work in to your research for your resume wording and you'll reap the rewards.\n* **DO NOT USE COLUMNS** (unless you're in a creative field like a designer, or your resume is being handed to someone in person) - Columns do not play nicely with ATS (AI resume reading software) and as the majority of companies now rely on ATS to quickly read resumes, you're shooting yourself in the foot by using columns or any other weird formatting.\n* Each bullet point should not be paragraphs long. Each bullet point should be 1-2 lines long only on the page, 3 maximum.\n* Each job should take up no more than 1/4 of the page, unless you've only had one or two jobs, or are more senior. Or in another unit of measurement, no more than 11 or 12 lines of the page. The more recent the role, and the more impressive the tasks, the more bullet points there should be, but don't just include the job description which leads me onto my next point...\n* Reiterating that each job should only include the achievements from that job, and only the most impressive things you achieved should be listed. Include KPIs, processes you implemented, articles you wrote, dollar amounts of your biggest sales or averages, include numbers of accounts you managed, or how many calls you took each day, if you went over your OTE what was the percentage, etc. It shouldn't read as a job description, you need to sell yourself and show them what you're capable of! (disclaimer - unless your jobs are more entry level or food service etc, then job descriptions are likely the norm).\n* Don't include irrelevant jobs/projects. If you worked at Starbucks for 6 months 5 years back, and you've had relevant experience in your field after that, then remove the Starbucks (or whatever other unrelated jobs you have) from your resume. Your resume should be tailored to the jobs you're applying for! To give you some more reference, I have been working since 2003, and my resume only has jobs from 2014 onwards.\n* **Try to have your dates on the right hand side of the page, and your position and company on the left (list the position first, then the company next to it or below it).** It's the standard, and makes the person reading your resume find the info much more quickly. Trying to make your resume too unique (again, unless you have a creative job then ignore this) will only hurt your chances of it being taken seriously. Of course you want to make it look nice, but try to follow the standard format where possible so it's easy to read.\n\n# SKILLS & INTERESTS\n\n* **Put your technical/software/program skills in one line**, separated by commas or | lines | like | these. Putting a single skill on each line is a waste of space, and will create too much white space. Your resume should be concise, to the point and get everything across in as little space as possible.\n* **Don't use the \"slider\" scales for your proficiency in various skills.** Why? Well, firstly, if the hiring manager wants to know your level in each, they will ask. And secondly, the dots or slider scales aren't measurable and take up extra wasted space that again is not going work well with ATS. Instead, as I mentioned above, list your skills and programs/software etc. in a line separated by commas | or | these | lines. Don't include software that you used 10 years ago and never progressed past a beginner level, but list pretty much everything else within reason. Most things you'll pick back up quickly even if it was 5 years ago, provided you were semi-decent with your knowledge of it.\n* What about interpersonal skills? Should you add them? I highly recommend adding them into your bullet points, rather than listing them separately. In saying that, though, there's going to be some industries, or some skills, that require them listed separately. If you're listing them separately, first ensure that you actually need them on the resume, and which ones are necessary and which ones can be removed if any. If you're still adament you want to list them separately, then put them in the same format as your technical/software skills as I listed above, either separating each with the | lines | like | these, or with commas, one on line. And that line needs to go below the hard/tech/software skills, not before, and ideally not together.\n* **Languages:** In North America, only list a languages section if you speak more than one language. Always list English first as this is a job requirement every time, and then other languages after that. If you're fluent in English, a native in Spanish, fluent in French, and have intermediate German, I would list it as such:\n   * \"Languages: Fluent in English, Spanish and French, intermediate in German.\"\n* **Interests - should you add them or not?** It's a highly debated topic and everyone will have a different view on this. I personally believe that you should include them. For example, I ride motorcycles and love stand up comedy shows, am coffee obsessed and love my local lacrosse team. Almost every single interview I land, my interests are brought up, with the interviewer connecting with one or more of my interests, or asking me more about them. It's a great conversation starter, and it makes you more than just an applicant, they will remember you as the person who they discussed their favourite sports team with, or the person who recommended them an amazing cafe that they've now added to their list. INTERESTS WILL MAKE YOU STAND OUT, I guarantee it. **Obviously, it can be negative depending on what you write, so be REALLY selective of what you include in your interests** (for example, don't include things like Anime or Manga, or the shooting range, or reading Holocaust novels, or your weapons collection, or anything political or religious, or anything you don't want to discuss during an interview - KEEP IT LIGHTHEARTED). I would make your interests 1 or 2 lines maximum on your resume, and don't go into detail (just list them out - for example, my interests on my resume are listed as \"Interests: Motorcycles, Warriors lacrosse, console and PC games, comedy shows, arcades, & searching for the perfect espresso.\") So basically, include them if you want, but if you do include them, make sure they aren't negative or controversial topics if it's brought up in an interview.\n\n# AVOID COMMON MISTAKES\n\n* \"References available upon request\" or adding references to your resume, is a BIG no no for North American resumes. Why? Because 1. it's assumed that you have references available on request, so including that is unnecessary, and 2. You don't want the company contacting your references if you've listed them, PRIOR to letting your bosses know, which is usually after you've received an offer, and 3. You don't want your references, whom have so kindly agreed to be one for you, getting inundated with calls or emails from the companies you're applying to, prior to the offer stage. Imagine applying to 50 companies, and all 50 call your references. Ouch. They won't be your reference for much longer.\n* Is your job across two pages? Nope, that's not going to work! I hate when I see a jobs bullet points going onto the next page. In my opinion, it's messy and just says \"poor formatting\".\n* **DO NOT MAKE YOUR RESUME TOO FLASHY! STOP WITH THE COLOURED TEXT!!** (this applies to non-design resumes only) Black text ONLY, with the exception of your name, contact information and section headers. You can put those in a colour other than black for a tiny bit of a \"pop\", but nothing overly in your face like red or bright pink. I personally use a dark blue, or dark green, or dark purple for the contact info and headers - DO NOT USE LIGHT COLOURS if you're going to use any at all. But objective/experience/skills/education etc, all the actual sections (not section headers) must be black text ONLY.\n* You absolutely should not have any images, and there should NOT be any background colour or background images whatsoever.\n* Do not use tables on your resume. That won't pass ATS and it looks pretty bad honestly.\n* Don't include a paragraph at the end along the lines of \"thanks for your time, please call me on 555-123-4567 if you have any questions or would like to set up an interview\". This isn't a cover letter. And even if it was, don't include your phone numebr or email in the cover letter body, that should be included with your contact details at the top of your cover letter, which should match the same format of your resume.\n* If you're going onto a second page, include the exact same name and contact information format as you have on your first (and other pages if outside of the US where more than 2 pages is common).\n\n# FINAL STEPS - SENDING YOUR RESUME\n\n* **NAMING YOUR RESUME:** And I'm not talking about naming him Resume McResumeface. Your resume name should be \"Firstname Lastname Resume\". Don't include the job title on there, or any periods, underscores, or any other information. \"J\\_Smith Customer Support Rep. Resume V2 Final\" is everything wrong with a resume title. I hear you asking, \"But holly948, how do I have multiple resumes then for the different jobs I'm applying to?\".\n* **ALWAYS SEND YOUR RESUME AS A PDF DOCUMENT!!** If you send it through as a Word document, their computer could mess with the formatting and it could ruin the perfect look of your resume. PDF will ensure they view it exactly how you have designed it to look. Sending through as a Word doc could ruin all of the hard work you put into the formatting. Devastating!\n\n# COVER LETTERS\n\nI'm sorry that's not my area, and I loath cover letters with a passion. Write them or don't, whatever. I personally never write cover letters as I find they are a waste of my time.\n\n# AKSHUALLY...\n\nLastly, I hear many of you about to furiously get into the comments with \"but my experience was...\" and \"in my opinion, you should...\", and \"actually, I think...\" and I get it! There is no \"one perfect way\" and everyone has different opinions. **This entire write up is in MY opinion and MY experience.** I'm not saying don't comment, just, please take this post as my opinion rather than \"it must be done exactly how I say or else you're never getting a job and your resume sucks\". Do whatever you want, man. Different things work for different companies and industries. This is my own general advice, and I know with resumes there is no \"one size fits all\". No two resumes I do are the same, because it comes down to the individuals experience, education, interests, what they're applying to and so many other factors. I'm just giving free advice from my own experience, in my own opinion, to serve the majority of people updating their resumes (primarily in North America).\n\n\\~\n\n**TL;DR** \\- **if you want to improve your resume, then I've given you everything you need minus the template.** **However, I'm doing up a template at the moment, and will share with you all, hopefully this weekend.** I want to give you all of the tools you need to succeed.\n\n*Enjoyed my advice from this post and/or the last? You can buy me a coffee!* [*https://www.buymeacoffee.com/holly948*](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/holly948)\n\nI sincerely hope this has helped, and I wish you all the best of luck in your job searches!",

    "text": "Dealing with resentment from being fired from a job So I was fired in March 2023 from a job  as a marketing consultant and it’s now July and I still feel bit  of rage and resentment about it.  Mainly just because of how I was fired which was done in a very sneaky, underhanded way. Additionally, I was given a weak/ vague excuse of just “job performance” it definitely just felt personal.  Also, I feel angry still is because looking back there were so many times I wish I had spoken up when I felt disrespected, or simply overwhelmed with zero help.\n\nFor context, the company I worked for was a small team of 16 people. I was the only black person with the rest mostly being white and conservative. My tasks included marking stuff like social media posts, graphic design,  web site management, press releases , company news letters, event assistance/ media coverage. I had to cover the receptionist whenever they were out of office or on  “vacation” and do their daily tasks ( which was a frequent thing).  To top it one, I regularly had to deal with a arrogant  micromanaging douchebag supervisor who criticized everything along with his female stooge. \n\nI admit I made mistakes but I was bussing my butt every day and constantly juggling my job and the receptionist job all the time. Near the end, I was having health related problems due to the stress of the job ( random nose bleeds,  lack of sleep, panic attacks). \n\nNonetheless, I will be starting another job soon ( not my ideal position but decent for now).  But it still eats me up that a toxic company is thriving. But I am still trying to just move forward and out the anger and resentment away.  Any advice to help just move on from this?",

    "text": "Are any of you office workers/\"white collar workers\" that have reason to believe you will never find a job again? Or a good job? \n\nI know this is very negative but the \"I got a job\" posts here, I suspect, are always from people who work in an \"in demand\" industry, were \"in-demand\" when they were let go, are where they're supposed to be for their age - senior - and are in the sweet spot of not being too old to face hardcore discrimination, but not so young as to be fresh out of college. I assume most of these people are either senior in a healthcare, tech, finance or IT niche. Maybe HR. Not a lot of office admin/generalists here over 30 in this subreddit.\n\nI am not built for trades/\"blue collar work\" (I do appreciate a lot of people here are trying to get out of that in this sub too), so I'm talking specifically about \"white collar\" industries. \n\n...What I find is that with age, having only something like online courses for the endless litany of softwares I've never used in a job (and might not be able to learn, like A/B testing)...it just gets worse, and worse, and worse. I look up my job specific title or the closest roles I can find on linkedin and find requests for Loopio and Canva and SQL for A, B, C, the ability to write macros and scripts in Tableau for....60k a year in a HCoL city. \n\nI find office admin roles are harder and harder to get, they typically want someone taking a step down (someone working HR for a bootcamp I went to an open house for, I realized, was the exec assistant in a tech company right afterward) and the hours are long and hard. To get a \"generalist\" job, you need to be able to take five days a week in an office - something I've lost, thanks to back problems (my worst problem, at this point) - and do 8-6, easy. It's hard to built up that experience without accepting poverty wages for a few years. Frankly, I did that, and it's gotten me nowhere. \n\nThere's no place to talk about aging out of the job market when you've only been in jobs that fail to teach you skills to stay in any career track. \n\nI've taken continuing ed, including in person, and it just hasn't helped at all. It was disconnected from work and bullshit in state-offered programs. \n\n\nI feel like shit because the liberal arts majors I went to high school with got around it, gone through economic crises, and they all ended up in marketing or (with some additional work, for some - many ended up in law, another lucking out because she worked in offices all through college and is now an office manager in a finance stting) - they're not going back for workshops on SQL for accounting or Quickbooks or VBA for piddling shitty low level sales jobs. \n\nI'm in the conundrum of too old to be \"entry level\" in anything, too old to worth hiring into a job where there's training (there is no training)....and the \"training\" period/\"entry level\" roles within a career path in a company are terribly paid. \n\nI realize younger candidates out there are suffering too, but this is worse. (I dealt with this out of college as well and in college, which is the reason it's been 10+ years since I've graduated and I'm worse off, not better.)\n\nBeing insulated from the job market as you age *and are out of the sphere of being educated/trained to do anything* or even have a chance is like having a disease. Christ, I thought my horrible major was disonnected from work back then....\n\nWhere is it acceptable even to talk about this shit, and being underemployed because with aging comes a loss of training into the current job market? \n\nDoes anyone relate?",

    "text": "Are you paranoid after the trauma of a bad job, bad luck, underemployment, etc? sorry for length, spooling vent below. \n\n\nI was laid off in August and I'm a few weeks into a *terrible* job with a massive paycut for the \"training period\" - I have my \"touchbase\" with HR in January. It's remote. I'm dreading it. I've grown to hate HR people - the middleman that will give me bad news, that's what I'm imagining. No offense to HR people of this sub, but from this, HR generally seems to exist to immiserate employees and enable the company in disposing of them and making them unhappy, in addition to justifying its existence by sourcing candidates, giving desperate people like me false hope, and then dismissing them in the candidate search. \n\nToday I had to do tasks for end-of-month alone and just...my manager goes on vacation tomorrow, it's right before Christmas...he didn't even zoom call me today. I worked without feedback the whole fuckin' day, for a very important task. I painstakingly went through it and every time I asked questions he just seemed frustrated. I know he had other stuff to do, *but if you're going to fire for fucking something up*, I could benefit from clear direction. Even before a holiday. \n\n\nI feel *unbearably* paranoid after being laid off and exposed to an otherwise very nice person's grouchy side by end of day. It's been six weeks and he's clearly frustrated, even if a task is new. There's no way to talk about it either. It's like telling a great white shark you're afraid they're going to eat you - planting the idea by stating the obvious. \n\nI'm going to say it - companies seem more adversarial than ever to their employees. I guess I'm used to it, but not quite like this, this continuously. Every time I start a new job, it really does seem worse. Something changed with lockdown too. I see the posts from people that talk about starting new jobs after a devastating layoff months before, only to be fired again; and there's no way to assess it, especially if you're the sort of person managers just don't value or like. \n\nIf you lack the certifications, software skills and smarts as a retiring, unappealing, quiet person, the only way to survive is through more and more hard skills, with each vice. I lack them. I have soft skills, but probably look and come off like a \"stereotypical STEM\" personality...yet none of the skills that excuse that. It's a bad combo. (This doesn't mean I don't make small talk but I don't want to talk about my personal life anymore...during the workday, I'm just tired. I just want to work.)\n\nI have lived my life around unemployment and the continuous fear of being fired (partially related to years of being relegated to temping agencies). \n\nThis job is baldly exploitative and pays as much as a temp job after the summer layoff. It's actually somewhat difficult sales support work but they're paying near minimum wage in my state. It just makes me fucking furious and ashamed of all the interviews in the last two years for jobs that still paid 20% lower than my previous salary that rejected me, after decent-seeming interviews and when I fit the bill for experience. \n\nI'm already in tears at least once a week and furiously angry at the lack of feedback because I think I'm trying pretty hard, but the silence seems like frustration - for asking too many questions to seem like I'm ready to work/absorbing the routine, to not fuck up...all of it. And anxiety makes doing simple tasks seem torturous, because of course, little mistakes become a big deal too. *My previous laying off manager has fucking destroyed my ability to be comfortable in a new job*, as insult laid upon injury. When I think of the big, nasty smile on his face when I was dropping off company property, I want to strangle him. \n\nIt creates a negative feedback loop that makes getting through the workday hard on that count too: I reflect that I have never worked in a job when I didn't feel like the stupidest person in an office (and probably am), unlike other people. It comes easily with doing administrative work, as admin/general office work is either limited to very bubbly, high energy, and/or senior people and then a tech team, a finance team, etc. and, yeah, maybe being stupid. I've never been important enough to train closely or valued closely. And learning the task of every new job seems harder and harder. Not just because it's like learning to read again - with each year I'm alive, after bad experiences, every day is filled with *paranoia* of incoming firing. The stress. The trauma. Fuck me, I wish I could win the lottery just to not experience what this is doing to me physically, what the expectation to go to office has done my whole life. To not go through the humiliation of interviewing and sending agonized-over \"thank you notes\" quickly followed by the slap in the face of a rejection 2 hours later (happened today after a decent seeming first round with a nice outgoing retiree).  \n\nI should be an excel expert right now. Having to do it in a new context exposes that the only thing I've really mastered is basic keyboard tricks and vlookup. Nothing in a \"serious\" job for accounting, making tables, creating proposals. But that isn't the (only) problem...it's the humiliation of feeling too important for a *better*, more valuable job than this, where I'm not treated like a nuisance for asking for feedback on my work. Where I'm skilled and important enough to be kept, instead of being in the cluster of jobs/people that can be eliminated or replaced.\n\n...I have never been rewarded for loyalty and my best is never good enough. Ever. \n\nWhen I think about the humiliation of being fired from a job paying something like 55% of my previous salary, I want to scream. I feel so helpless. \n\nTry too hard, struggle to much, show the effort in a new, unfamiliar job and in an era anyone that needs to be trained on new tasks is DOA - look like a fucking idiot, piss off your manager, seem like a needy dumbshit - get fired. Be isolated in complete shame, self-respect, and from work/being trained to acquire new knowledge again.\n\nBe passive and paralyzed with uncertainty and the desire not to look stupid when you're not being trained, when you go hours without clear direction every day, and the day's or week's expectations are uncertain - get fired. \n\nWork in a \"new role\" at the bottom, paid like shit, *because you are desperate and humiliated* and the sort of person in this economy that can have a college degree, a fair amount of experience and education in your field (sales support)....get fired. Be perpetually fireable. \n\nDo any of you relate? \n\nAnd it's not just being or feeling stupid that's a torture...I can never ascend. \n\n\n\nThere is no life apart to be lived from this. If you feel like a failure and like your life is built on the uncertain ground of aging while underemployed for your entire career, in spite of trying to acquire more skills on the cheap while working...it's never enough. And yes, you start to take it all personally, the judgment you don't deserve to feed and clothe yourself, that your best efforts to contribute are no good. (I know how stupid and pathetic this is! It's the truth. I'd like to at least say I am employed. The only people and companies that employ me make me think I'd be better off dead - no need to pay rent that way. I have nothing else to live for and no sources of happiness. I live hand to mouth in jobs nobody I went to school with or grew up with would take, or have to take. It's completely impossibly not to internalize with terror and shame.) \n\nIt's always been this way, since college. If you're really bad at the most important arena of your life - school/work - it precludes talking about yourself to people truthfully. It's impossible to make new friends, or be around people, because the truth is unbearable. \n\nIt makes it harder and harder to be with anyone you \"know\". And the work, the stress, the sweaty pathetic scrounging and never getting anyplace better taking up so much time, in the place of *living a normal life*, with relationships and pleasure - going to fucking workshops and taking free online courses to put on a resume to get nowhere with it, the humiliation of it all - I'm finished. This is my *entire life*, the main consumer of my physical, emotional and intellectual energy. There's nothing left over, and honestly, I feel so bad about myself - have since college, and this experience, not to mention the recursive *punishments* that come with working in shit jobs and for shit companies, in a city full of 21 year olds that have English majors and score internships for Google, Goldman Sachs, white shoe law firms like it's nothing...passive suicidal ideation is the only certainty that I've held onto into adulthood. \n\n\nI fantasize about being the women I went to school with - they're \"managers\" or software engineers after they got to major in art history, and now they're senior marketing majors pulling $100k+. They have full lives. \n\nThey've not sweating bullets and crying because being employed in truly horrible jobs is all they have going for them after a layoff that seems like a life-defining layoff, looking at an economy like this.\n\n\nIf the arena of your life that consumes your whole person is employment, and you've never worked in a good job, with a good salary, where you're treated with respect and can get comofortable - it makes you sick. \n\nI had a pretty bad job I was laid off from before this one, but I think that was as close as I was going to get. I was as close to happy as I could hope to be in my last long-term temp assignment before that job and before some horrible health decision, but of course, that ended. I was happy in the first of five years in my long-term job. \n\n\nThey both paid shit, were uncertain, and were unimportant. They had no future, no promotional track built in. \n\nAnd now I can reflect on losing those things and not being like other people, enough to hold onto something as piddling and pathetic as a not-terrible job.",

    "text": "I was screamed at by some right wing psycho in Costco yesterday while waiting for ice cream with my five year old. There were probably 30 people waiting for food because Saturday Costco is bananas but my son really wanted to try the new strawberry ice cream they have here. I figured no big anyways since my husband offered to deal with the check out line. We ordered and walked off to the side next to some white boomer dude and his wife. \n\nIt's Texas so of course we start up a conversation in line. I mentioned how rough it must be to work there since it looked like all of five people were getting the food out. This somehow visibly pissed him off and he started in on how a job is a job. I probably should have left it, but I decided to just casually say some jobs are a lot tougher than others. His next words exactly were \"just like a fucking Democrat\" and I said something like really dude? It was over at that point. \n\nHe went fucking nuts. He started screaming at me to go back to California? I picked up my son and said I was a Texan, born and bred, but that I thought it was time to leave it at agree to disagree because he was becoming aggressive. **I walked to the other side of the counter with my son** and he is yelling the entire time. I'm standing there in a group of strangers and the guy is just going off on me while my son is clutching me and clearly terrified. \n\nThen I did it friends, I turned to look at him and I said you look as stupid as you sound or something to that effect and this one statement back was enough to make him push his cart over to his wife and stomp past me, **literally knocking into my shoulder**, just to let me know he could hurt me if he wanted. \n\nI'm on the verge of tears and I go find my husband and tell him what happened. My husband tells me the point him out and he walks over ready to murder the guy. Wouldn't you know it, all of a sudden now that a man is involved the guy has a visible tail between his legs look. He just starts saying \"No disrespect\" over and over like as though that fucking means anything. He wouldn't even look at me. I asked why he was apologizing to my husband for screaming at me and he still just kept talking to my husband. It made me feel so fucking small and weak.\n\nI don't know what I even want from this post except to cry about the fact that I can't even feel safe getting ice cream at fucking Costco anymore. I feel like I can't go anywhere without my husband. This is the worst one, but it's not the first time a guy has made me feel unsafe with my kids in tow. The last few years have been horrendous. There's nothing more jarring than the moment when you don't know how to protect your child from a stranger. I'm just scared and angry. Why the fuck are people like this?\n\nEdit: I think it's important to note that I couldn't even find a manager because they were so busy. And this is Texas, I wanted out of there before the guy had time to get to his I'm sure oversized truck and grab a gun. I just wanted to go home, and I think a lot of y'all would have felt the same way in the situation. I also do carry pepper spray but I definitely couldn't have used it here. So I'm kindly asking to please stop giving me advice, I just want to vent. Thank you all though for your concerns, it is appreciated.",

    "text": "Just had a guy almost get physically aggressive with me at a bookstore. He then threw a tantrum and was asked to leave by management. I had just walked into a small section to peruse the titles when I heard him walk in. He immediately rudely sighed in an attempt to make me uncomfortable and leave the space. I almost moved out of the way despite the fact that I had the right to look at books and was there first. Instead, I squatted down to get a book to look at. He then grabbed SEVERAL books INCHES from my face and head. It was wildly inappropriate, and he wasn’t even looking for a specific title. When I refused to give in to his entitled behavior and continued to quietly look, he sat in a chair only 2-3 feet away from me and STARED. I looked at him and said, “I have the right to occupy space and peruse this section just like you.” He got huffy and said he was just waiting “patiently.” I said, “No you’re not. Feel free to take your misogyny elsewhere because I fully plan on staying in this section.” He lost it, stood up, NEARLY HIT MY FACE to put a book back, all while calling me…(wait for it)…a “fucking feminist.” Yes, he really said that. In other words, he knew exactly what he was doing. \n\nSome female staff members overheard him and came over. I immediately told them I was being harassed. This guy starts throwing an expletive-laced tantrum, which immediately let everyone know that I was telling the truth. Management had zero interest in listening to him at that point and told him to leave. I had to fight every groomed bone in my body not to apologize to the staff for an incident that wasn’t my fault and simply said “thank you.” I should also mention that I am a cishet white woman, and he appeared cis white as well, which is why I knew it was pure misogyny. I have no doubt he would have been exponentially worse with a non-white and/or non-conforming person who chose to stand their ground. I’m still shaking and I’m still stunned that someone could feel so entitled…in a damn bookstore.",

    "text": "Am I overreacting? Pregnant, and mom keeps insisting I move back to a very red state. Can someone tell me if I am overreacting/pregnancy hormones, or if I had a right to be mad at this?\n\nFor about 5 years, my husband and I lived in Florida. Florida was always a bit red, but we lived there before DeSantis got into office, so it was manageable, especially living in a blue city. Everything went downhill once Desantis was elected. \n\nMy husband and I had a dream from the start of our relationship to move to Colorado, and once Florida politics got worse and worse, we decided to just up and move. Especially since we were starting to talk about having kids. I refused to have children in a state that has no human rights. Plus, as a bisexual, very pro choice woman, it was not the place for me. My husband agreed. The only reason he liked Florida was because of the warm weather, he has some chronic pain ailments and the cold weather makes them worse. \n\nAnyway, I think from the time we moved, my mom held on to a glimmer of hope that I or we would move back. Always dropping little comments that I could move back in with mommy if my marriage doesn't work out (which I would never do). Trying to bait me by sending me photos of the beach saying \"don't you miss this?\" (no. Mountains > oceans. Plus, I can fly two hours to California, have a beach AND human rights! Win win!). Bragging that it's 80 degrees in February in the hopes that I'll say I miss it. This continued even after my husband and I bought a house here, basically showing the long term commitment of staying here. Her argument is because we live in a slightly red area of Colorado, it's \"basically the same\" as Florida and may as well come back. Um, no, it's not. At all. The city leans slight red and is surrounded by blue areas. It's been incessant little comments since we moved in 2021. \n\nThe \"funny\" thing is, my mom is a democrat. She hates Desantis. But, she loves the warm weather. And has, verbatim said \"As much as I disagree with his politics, as a post menopausal, straight white woman, they don't have much of an impact on me\". I like the warm weather too, as does my husband for reasons mentioned above. But human rights matter more to us, so if the cold becomes too much ever, we will move to California. \n\nNow, I'm pregnant. Yay!! This has only made her comments much worse. We don't have any family in this state, BUT my husband and I are both self employed, doing very well financially, and we will both have the ability to be stay at home parents as we set our own schedule and have savings to not work for up to a year. My husband is extremely hands on, and I know he will do everything I do less breastfeeding and birth. I do not underestimate how hard parenting is, but I think I have an advantage being that we can both be stay at home parents, we can afford a post pardum doula, and my husband isn't a loser man child that sees childcare as \"women's work\".\n\nI know this sounds dramatic, but I would literally rather be a single mother in a dingy studio apartment on welfare vs move back to Florida. This is truly how strongly and angry I feel about it. \n\nThe last time my mom made a comment relating to us moving back to Florida, I snapped. I lost it. I told her it's evident that she cares more about selfishly seeing me/her grandkid, then she does them having human rights (especially so if this child is a girl). She cares more about seeing me, than me having rights, and me being in a place that makes me happy. I said it's disgusting how she can care so little about politics that don't directly impact her life, especially as she was a teacher all her life, mostly teaching students of very marginalized backgrounds. I said \"you literally live in the North Korea of the USA and you want me to come back??!\" It was a very heated convo and we haven't spoken in a week. \n\nIf she genuinely and whole heartedly wants to see me and her grandkids more, nothing/no one is stopping her from selling her home and moving to Colorado. But ohhhhh noooo its cold here!!!!!!! It snows here!!!!!!! I don't know anyone there!!!!!!!!!!! It's more expensive!!!!!!!!!! \n\nIs Colorado perfect politically? No, no location is perfect. But I love it here for reasons beyond politics. It is the most scenic and beautiful state I have ever seen. I take two to three hikes a week, and can't wait to do more 14ers once not pregnant. The people here are so much nicer too. Overall, there's very little I don't like here. \n\nAny outside thoughts would be appreciated, but either way, it felt good to get this off my chest.",

They report that medical staff don’t listen to them when they complain of symptoms, and dismiss or downplay their concerns.

Hi I'm 29F (Have PCOS and Insulin Resistance) and I have been in vagina hell since June 2023.\n\nI'd like to note at this time, my house did not have good AC/basically none and we were dealing with MASSIVE heatwaves. It all started when I got a constant sensation that I needed to pee, even when I just peed. I didn't go to the doctor for a bit, thinking I just needed to drink crap tons of water and it would go away. Two days went by and it didn't, so I talked to my doctor. I got a urine test, no results.\n\nI decided to see if there was something irritating it and found discharge that looked like wet toilet paper. I figured this was a yeast infection so I went to the doctor who just took one look and went \"Yep that's yeast\" and prescribed me diflucan. I took that and there was very little improvement. So I went back and she said the swelling was down and gave me another. It didn't get that much better, the sensation was still there. So I went to a hospital clinic and got tested there. She said I had BV, so I got antibiotics. Took that, felt better but then things came back all of a sudden. She figured it was the yeast from the last bit so she gave me more diflucan but for once a week for four weeks. Which did jack all. So I went back to my primary care. She said my sensation and even thin vaginal discharge was normal. I didn't feel like it was since I usually had clear or milky or none.\n\nI tried relaxing for awhile. (I even got to masturbate for the first time in months)  but it didn't do much better. So I went to the hospital again. That's when she diagnosed me with a UTI. I got two rounds and finally the constant sensation is gone but the discharge is still there. So I went back to my primary (For the record, each of them kept going on vacation so I had to go to the other), and she said it was just my body recovering. So I listened but then my vagina ITCHED like CRAZY. I had diflucan given along with the antibiotics so I got that. That made everything better almost INSTANTLY. But I was only given four days and after the fourth, things were getting bad again so I used monistat cream on the outside.  So far that has made things manageable and I was having better days but my discharge is still white and thick.\n\nI just went to the doctor AGAIN and got tested and she's saying there's no growth even though my discharge is still white, clumpy and thick.\n\nI have no idea what to do anymore. It feels like no one is listening to me. My periods have also not been fun as they have been like one-two days of blood flow and then the rest is brown and annoying. I am figuring that's because I messed up on birth control a few times and my hormones have to regulate. But I doubt that has anything to do with this.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Please? I don't have anyone really to ask about vagina things. My roommates are both AMAB and talking anything about vaginas with my mother will result in getting hung up on.  \n\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone so much for your input! I have taken in affect everything based off my personal health and how I've been feeling overall. I have also been talking to my boyfriend and best friend. (My roommates mentioned above) They have been super understanding and supportive. My boyfriend's mother was a nurse so he asks her for medical things sometimes. So far I'm pretty sure I have a yeast infection still. Discharge is white, thick and clumpy. Still dealing with itching/irritation. My primary doctor is not listening to my concerns as the growth test was negative but I'm still having issues. My irritation does get some relief after going to the bathroom but not for super long. I also do not have the constant peeing issue as last night I even got to sleep fully and not wake up in the middle of the night or if I do? I just get up once. (I drink a full 16 oz. glass of water before bed for my other medication. So one time is normal for me.) \n\nI will be talking about boric acid things and anything with blood sugar will have to wait until the 20th for my endocrinologist. Just a general thing. I visit them every six months and they're a two hour drive from where I live. (Small towns are fun.) \n\nI'm sorry if I couldn't respond to everyone! I...don't have the mental capacity to handle all of this at once so I had to leave some comments be. I hope any other vagina haver can look at the advice given and use it! Seriously, they need to give us an instruction booklet for this hell. Anyway, everyone have a wonderful day and I'll let you know what my doctor says. (After I fight her AGAIN before going to the hospital clinic.)",

    "text": "Police are corrupt and defend violent rich white men. I don’t feel safe. I’ve been threatened to not tell this story but I’m hoping I can be vague.\n\n**The event:**\nAbout a year ago, I was harassed and threatened by a rich white man while I was alone outside of my office. I think his goal was either to intimidate me from doing my job or to physically harm me. He screamed in my face for fulfilling my job duties, which are required by law. I was scared so I asked him to back away while I go inside to call the police. He got more violent and told me I was threatening him. He falsely imprisoned me / restrained me in front of my office and wouldn’t let me inside to call for help. He kept coming closer to me and I was afraid of an assault. I told him I didn’t feel safe and he was being unprofessional.\n\nOnce I made it inside and asked him to stay outside, he barged in. I was too afraid to turn my back to him to get my phone and call the police. I thought he would physically harm me if I did. He said things like, “Isn’t there a man I can speak to?” The answer was no because I’m the manager. And he couldn’t answer my question of “what does that have to do with anything?” He eventually left. \n\n**Aftermath and police corruption:**\nI was shaking and called the police. I told them I felt like I was in danger. The police assured me I would be fine, and did not care that I was illegally restrained. My employer sent him a letter saying it was unacceptable. The man’s lawyer sent us a letter back denying the occurrence and said if I talk about this, I’d be sued for defamation.\n\nI FOILed for the police report so I could start a paper trail. The police report I received did not contain my complaints or fear of my safety. It favored the man that harassed me and effectively swept the whole event under the rug. All it said was that he visited me and we had a discussion. Nothing about false imprisonment or harassment. My employer and I complained to the police. The police investigated after reviewing their body cam footage of me reporting I didn’t feel safe, and apologized. They told us that the man has an insider, and got the police report changed to cover it up. I don’t know if it was a bribe but the police told us this. \n\nBecause of this and lack of documentation of criminal activity, I am not eligible to obtain an order of protection. The police were unable to update the police report due to policy. Funny it can be changed for corruption but not for a mistake. \n\n\n**My question to you:**\nAll in all, how can we, as women, ever feel safe in a word like this with police corruption defending wealthy aggressors? Why can and do they get away with this? Can I trust if I’m assaulted that I’ll be protected by local police? Has anyone had something similar happen to them? It feels so isolating.",

    "text": "My workplace is literally 99% young women. Last night after we closed a creepy man was loitering outside, waiting for my coworker and I to leave. It was scary. I’m still a little shaken up by this. I’m a VERY petite woman who lives in a relatively safe town. You don’t often hear about this kind of thing happening. I’m 24, and was working with my 21 yo coworker. She’s only a little taller than me; both of us are pretty small.\n\nImmediately after we closed the store (at 8:29 instead of 8:30 because we wanted to go home lol) we went outside to collect the outside trash to take it to the dumpster. It’s a rule at our work that we must take out the trash in pairs at night.\n\nWhile my coworker was waiting for me to finish tying up the garbage bag so we could walk it to the trash, this old guy in his 60s(?) kept trying to talk to us. I honestly didn’t absorb jack shit of what he said because we just closed and I was trying to go about with my own business. But my coworker later told me he was trying to make conversation about the weather. She smiled at him but neither of us responded to him. I expected him to leave but he didn’t. Then he said something else about the weather and didn’t get a response again. He still just kept standing there. Then he said something about, “I don’t know why everyone thinks I’m an asshole” and put on a black face scarf. I saw this too. My alarm bells went off. From the spot he was standing in, he was kind of cornering us into the patio area. I said to my coworker, “Y’know what, I think we forgot to do something. Let’s head back in to get that done before we go.” I’m so glad I followed my intuition and that she didn’t question my excuse. She was creeped out too.\n\nAfter we got inside and locked the door we immediately talked about how weird and creepy that guy was??? We planned to finish up the other closing duties before taking out the trash so we could wait for him to leave but he was standing there waiting for us. FOR LIKE 15-20 MINUTES. Several times we kept wondering, “Is he still there?” and peeked out the window to see him standing there in the dark, with a face scarf and bucket hat on, staring at the store. We don’t have a back door. He was standing at the only exit.\n\nI quickly took a picture of him, for evidence I guess? The photo I got didn’t capture any notable features because in the dark he was just a black silhouette. Maybe that was a stupid thing to do because he saw me. He started knocking on our door! We didn’t answer obviously. We were freaked out and wanted to get out of there ASAP. Fuck the rest of the closing duties lol we needed to leave.\n\nI called one of the businesses next to us to ask if they could send someone to walk us to the trash and our cars. They didn’t answer (I think they were closed) so I tried the restaurant across the street. Thankfully they did answer. I explained the situation and the employee on the phone said she’d send her manager who’s “very big and scary.” The manager came over, and he was a very tall but  lean and kinda scrawny guy. I found a little bit of humor in that lmao 😅. He came over with another male employee too.\n\nWe thanked them profusely and they walked us to the trash. We passed the creepy guy and he said something to us, I have no idea what, my brain couldn’t process it for some reason. I think I just wanted to focus on leaving while acting normal. After taking out the trash we had to walk back around the corner near the spot he was standing and he was gone. The employees walked us to our cars and we got the heck out of there lol. I made my coworker text me when she got home safe. Then I started a GC with our manager and told her about the situation. (When I gave a physical description of the guy and mentioned his grey stubble she said “Ew he sounds gross” LMAO that made me feel a bit better about everything somehow). I have to file an incident report when I go back into work today.\n\nThis whole situation was pretty terrifying. My workplace is full of teenage and early 20s girls. We’re really vulnerable. I’m glad I go outwardly deadpan and emotionless in situations like these, because I had my wits about me and was able to make some good decisions while being calm.\n\nOne thing I kind of wish I did was call the police. When the creepy guy started knocking on the door I was contemplating calling 911. This probably sounds kinda stupid but I was afraid of them not taking us seriously. What if they were like “Maam this isn’t an emergency, next time call the non-emergency line” or what if they took eons to show up? I’m also a little scared of the police after everything that happened in 2020. I doomscrolled a lot back then and saw too many videos of police either abusing their power or being completely useless. I’m half Asian and easily white passing but as a really tiny woman I’m really easily intimidated. My manager said that if this happens again to go ahead and call the cops. I’m going to warn all the other girls who work closing shifts too, because I feel like this creep will probably show up again.\n\nThat’s it. I guess I just needed to get this out, and to have something to help me file an incident report at work later. After work I went over to my godparents house (my only family, also I live alone and was not in the mood to return to my dead silent house at night). That helped a lot and they made me feel safe for a bit.\n\nNever posted here before. I’m looking forward to my free Reddit Cares handout that everyone seems to get! 🤲",

    "text": "why does society hate opinionated women so much? I had a conversation with an old co-worker of mine that has really just had me doing mental gymnastics for a few days, so I decided to come here to discuss it as I think this might be something many of you can relate with.\n\nI got a new job during COVID for one of the top 5 major banks in the US. I was so excited as I thought it would be *huge* for my career. Little did I know how positively toxic the workplace culture was and how positively disorganized it was despite how large the organization was. I was immediately targeted by the older women in the workplace, very few people would help me (to cover for their own incompetency, I later learned) when I needed it. I was often ostracized when they would do team outtings and intentionally leave me out. At one point, one of the women openly insinuated I was having an affair with my coworker, which was absolutely untrue and unfounded. Peers openly blocked me from helping in capacities that I was strong in, refuses to listen to any suggestions I had, and would openly come up with systems they'd work on together and leave me out of. I would usually find out they were doing this in team meetings, and when I brought the behavior up to my boss and how I was feeling, I was told I simply couldn't take feedback.\n\nNothing could have been more true. I burned for feedback, I desired to be told how to do better. Instead I would speak and sometimes offer insight or a suggestion, and peers would move on like nothing was said at all. I was so open to creating projects and systems and trainings together, but no one wanted to be part of it.\n\nEventually, when my mental health was taking a huge hit and I was questioning myself even outside of work and experiencing significant imposter syndrome on top of workplace bullying, ostracization and sexual harrassment, I made the decision to let go and seek employment elsewhere. \n\nIt has been night and day, and my mental health couldn't be better. \n\nOne of my old coworkers called me the other night as he recently moved to a new employer and we were catching up. He mentioned a lot of people were leaving en masse as the toxicity has only increased. He apologized for what he went through and actually admitted that he knew he was treated differently as a white passing man in that place and leveraged it to his advantage multiple times there, but still hated seeing how I was treated. Nevertheless he never stood up for me or acted in any way to help change the workplace. Instead, he chameleoned in, his explanation, and watched all the chaos unfold. He never really made problems for me directly, but he never coached his staff and it created issues inadvertently and sometimes created more work for me and I do think he was a little toxic towards staff members. He said some pretty nasty things to staff over messages, and yet I would often get spoken to and reprimanded for small things. I was written up for saying \"yooo!\" In chat and told it was inappropriate for a manager to use \"that kind of language\".\n\nAnyway, this is what really stopped me in my tracks:\n\n\"It's because you're nice, and no one knows what to do with genuinely nice people, and you're really intimidating with your experience, but it was mostly because you were so opinionated. And you were often right but no one cared because that place was so toxic and no one really wanted to change the things they needed to because boohoo work. But you, you did the work ApriKot, and people turn you into the bad guy while I do nothing and everyone tell me how amazing I am and like, am I though?\"\n\nIt just makes me so mad how the world views strong, opinionated women. I am so tired of fighting the patriarchy but it will forever, and ever, be a fight I persist in. I'm tired of extending goodness and hardwork and watching my male peers be forever less than mediocre and continue to step on the backs on women like me, while other women continue to bully strong women and uphold men who behave like this and each other. It just weighs on my heart so heavily.\n\nThanks for listening.",

    "text": "AITA for telling my manager he doesn’t understand after a customer followed me around work for over three hours while having fun with himself? I’d be remiss to not start with saying I KNOW men can be bothered, including in the work environment. My brother works with me at Food Lion and he’s bothered by older women at least two times out the week. Anyways, I’m a personal shopper so I walk around a store all day for my job. I started my orders around 1pm and noticed a man with a white shirt walking around with a baking sheet and blue/green-striped gift bag. I made a mental note of this because it was an odd sight (the way he was hugging the baking sheet), I assumed it was a gift of some sort. During my orders, I see this man on several different occasions over the course of three hours (1:00-4:15ish). By 2:30 I started becoming concerned because it felt like everywhere I went he was there (he ditched the gift bag and kept the baking sheet). I (falsely) assumed he maybe had some sort development/neurological disorder. I notified a coworker and she followed him for a bit, then she came back to tell me his movements look like he’s searching the aisles for me. It turns out my coworkers found him having fun with himself in one of the aisles. Anyways, I was beating myself up for not reporting him sooner since I waited OVER two hours. Then again, I feel like I’m so familiar with the various ways to be bothered. I’ve had people grab my waist (to “help me through the door” or whatever that means), brush up against my backside, stare ONLY at my chest while talking with me, follow me briefly down the aisles during my orders (to watch me bend down/over), and even the more subtle ways like asking about where an item is in the store to start a conversation with me (in which they’ll ask if I’m single and or want to exchange numbers/social medias). Due to my past experiences, I’m aware of how I’m perceived and how that manifests in social interactions. My manager was telling me to stay more vigilant (he’s “always aware of what’s going on around him”) and I understand that sentiment, I really do. Still, I feel like who would expect someone to be having fun with himself under a baking sheet in the middle of Food Lion in the early afternoon. I asked around with other coworkers and they assumed he might be stealing if anything. Regardless, during the conversation it just felt like he didn’t understand my perspective, so I brushed it off and said it must be a “woman thing”. However, that statement is highly problematic. I went back to him later on and apologized for my wording as it didn’t truly convey my point. I ended up saying that “we have different experiences in society due to the differences in our backgrounds, appearances, and genders”. To shorten it, I told him it wasn’t my intention to invalidate any experiences he might of had or still has, but my experiences are extensively different from his. These issues occur so frequently for me, including another manager telling me I need the “right man” with a “big fun time” to “not be confused” about my sexuality. Back to the question, AITA for essentially saying his appearance limits him from really understanding the extent of botherment I face on the daily (but in a nicer, less blunt way)? I just honestly wouldn’t consider his experiences comparable to mine or even my brother in the slightest. I doubt anyone would follow him around the store for three hours having fun with themselves I guess? Is that a valid statement or like some form of lookism? Also, if anyone has any advice on how to cope or deal with these problems feel free to comment. I’m trying to not be so passive about boundaries. I personally don’t think I’m that attractive, maybe slightly above average? It seems like nearly every time I go out these issues arise no matter my clothes, makeup, or hair. I’ll change my pfp to me for reference (same uniform, but my hair was up that day).",

    "text": "The Other Side of the Veil. It starts suddenly. I am awoken by searing eye pain. Half remembered dreams quickly fade as I fumble for my glasses. A lot of tearing. It feels like sand caught under my eyelid. I make my way over to the bathroom. My left eye is red and the eyelid somewhat edematous. Maybe something stung me? I take some ibuprofen and go back to bed. The pain recedes to a more manageable level. It helps if I keep my eye totally still. My mind retreats to fitful sleep.\n\nSome hours later, I reawaken; my eye still hurts. A lot of crustiness. I blink a few times to untether my eyelid. More ibuprofen. Some eye drops. I go about my day. The pain is constant but manageable. I frantically scroll through Uptodate. Lateral episcleritis. It sort of feels like what’s described, “but visual acuity is never affected”. Is my visual acuity affected? I look at a shampoo bottle with my good eye and then the other. It’s unequivocally worse in the affected eye. Fuck. Conjunctivitis? Maybe, but the conjunctiva is not really that red anymore. Keratitis? I mean, I do wear contact lenses which the article keeps harping on and on about. But that’s really serious. Nah it can’t be that. Don’t be a hypochondriac.\n\nI Google Ophthalmologists near me but it’s Saturday and of course they are all closed. God damn ROAD to success. Do I go to urgent care? Nah they’ll do the same Uptodate search and send me on my way with a referral for Monday. Hospital? With my deductible; yeah right. I guess the pain is better now. Maybe my glasses script needs to be updated? Is it all in my head? I whisper some self-affirmations to myself and relax somewhat.\n\nSunday comes and goes. The pain is getting better but the blurriness remains. 8 AM Monday, I call the ophthalmologist’s office.\n\n“This is Dr. 4990; Dr. C and I have collaborated in the care of a few patients. I was hoping he could see me first thing. It’s a bit of an urgent situation.\"\n\n“No problem, come at 9, the doctor will see you as an add on.”\n\nMini panic attack that my insurance isn’t in-network. Psych, it actually is. Nervously, sitting in the waiting room. Listening to the same infomercial for cataract multifocal lenses on television. “See life the way it was supposed to be seen”. Fuck, I want that more than anything. Pray a little. Remember I’m an atheist. Scroll UptoDate a little more as a substitute bible.\n\nWhirling and whizzing of machines. Green drops. A puff of air on my eyeballs. The doctor comes in. We exchange quick pleasantries.\n\n“Well it is bacterial keratitis, but you’re very lucky. There is no ulcer and the infiltrate is very small. We’ll start you on antibiotic drops every 2 hours and that will take care of it.”\n\n“What’s the prognosis, doc?”\n\n“Excellent. But maybe it’s time to think about LASIK?”. The upsell. I know it well. His body language indicates that he is not worried. I am awash with relief.\n\nWe arrange to meet again in 2 days to make sure that it is resolved. A few hours later the antibiotics are clearly working. The blurriness is resolving. I feel so supremely grateful for modern medicine. Moxifloxacin. Even the word is kind of rad.\n\nI arrive to my own clinic and don my own white coat.\n\n“Doctor, I’m covered in this rash. It started all of a sudden. I read that it could be syphilis; It’s really freaking me out”  Obvious herald patch, pityriasis rosea. Reassurance. Appreciation.\n\n“I just don’t want to be bald” A lot of tears. Post Covid telogen effluvium.\n\n“I promise you its going to be alright. Your prognosis is excellent!\"\n\n\"It’s not melanoma, just a seborrheic keratosis. Totally benign and would't give it a second thought\" \n\n“Oh my god, you have no idea how relieved I am!\"\n\nOn and on. But with new found appreciation and gratitude.",

    "text": "I may have rage quit my PRN job after getting punched in the face… I recently started a new ER job in a wealthy suburb but stayed PRN in the city ER I’ve been at for years, nervous I would hate the clientele. \n\nIn the month that I have been there, I have not been assaulted, verbally abused, heck people have barely even been rude. \n\nThe shift I had at the city last night will be my last. \n\nWas not expecting it to be. I hadn’t had a shift in a minute, and everyone was really happy to see me which made me feel great. \n\nBut of course I came in to a full ER and waiting packed room and was given a group of beds in the hallway. Cool, I thought. Probably gonna get a bunch of easy 3s from the waiting room. \n\nNope. Back to back to back ambulances. Could barely finish triaging one before I got another, had to manually take vitals because I didn’t have a working vitals machine, and they were ALL inappropriate for the hallway. \n\nI finally finish the last’s triage when a cardiac arrest comes in. There are no techs so it’s just me and another nurse switching meds and compressions. We finally call it and I finally go back to my pod, very winded, and someone complains that they’ve been sitting there for an hour and I haven’t done a thing for them. Typical. \n\nI’m rushing to line and lab my very sick pod when the least sick of them, who came in very pleasant, starts to yell about wanting to go home and that I’m mistreating her. I realize she’s sundowning, but make a bit of a show of trying to reason with her because the other three hallway beds have full view of the scene. Of course it doesn’t work. \n\nThe doc needed info from her nursing home. The phone I had was missing the cord so I could only talk on speaker. They hung up on me because they couldn’t hear me over the patient yelling. \n\nThen I get a critical for another patient. Hgb 3.2. I tell charge this patient needs a room. There are none.\n\nIm trying to type and screen the low hgb when grandma ends up wiggling her way to the foot of the bed with her leg stuck in the side rail. I grab another nurse to help me get her back up in bed. \n\nThe second I let go, she punches me in the face. \n\n“Hey. Not okay. Ma’am, if you hit someone again we’re going to have to put you in restraints” \n\nShe swings again. \n\nSo now I’m putting her in softs while she screams that she did not hit me and that I am racist (I’m white and work with a primarily black population) \n\nAt this point, there’s a visitor of a roomed patient standing in the hall with her arms crossed glaring at me like I’m the devil. I politely ask her to step back inside the room, and she responds “I’m good right here. People like me and her need to look out for each other.” \n\nMy heart SANK y’all. I take no pleasure in restraining and sedating anyone. I try to empathize with the tendency to think an HCW is being racist, but it really hurts my feelings when I get accused of it. \n\nThis visitor ends up talking to the assistant manager about me. Bro does not stand up for me at all and he too questions my actions until security confirms the strike was caught on camera. \n\nAnd then what do I get?? The classic “what do you think you could have done differently” \n\nMy guy, I just got punched in the face. You didn’t even ask me if I’m okay, and after knowing me for years still questioned my ethics. We don’t have time for this. Someone else here desperately needs blood. \n\nEmbarrassingly, I am in tears when I tell him I am done, he needs to take my patients, and this will be my last shift. I let some other coworkers know I won’t be returning and give a few hugs on the way out. Got in my car and never looked back. \n\nI did get a text from the educator that heard what happened, asked if I was okay and said she was sorry to see me go. So that’s something. It really wasn’t the way I wanted to end my time there, getting emotional, but I was gonna need the push one way or another.",

    "text": "In the closet transwomen nurse Highly debating switching from my Adult Med Surg unit to NICU TLDR: I’m a dark, south Asian mtf (in the closet) in the nursing field and am concerned if I will not fit in a NICU unit that is 90%+ white women because of previous experiences. I also have minimal experience with babies. Med surg unit feels like I’m not critically thinking as much as I would like and don’t like the population that much \n\n\nIn case some background info: I worked in BMT at a highly regarded hospital and was fired, had an extremely terrible time there even though I decided to be a peds nurse. Because of the area I’m in I had to go to adult health care. If it matters here’s my experience that had me switch https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/134qb9u/how_is_the_pediatric_nurse_environment_had_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1\n\nSo I have been working in my med surg unit for 6 months now, 4 months out of orientation. I have gotten semi-comfortable in the sense that I think I can handle what the shift can potentially entail. However though we have a 28 bed unit and we sometimes run 5 nurses and 1 PCA so we each get 6 patients. Some of these patients are extremely heavy and in general I just am NOT interested in the older adult population. \n\nBut in general a lot of my patients really like me and enjoy me as their nurse since they feel I advocate for them. My manager before she left (we have an interim manager on another floor and no educator) said I have been doing really well and am on track as a new grad nurse. \nMy preceptor also said I am doing great and is now trying to get me oriented as a charge nurse because of staffing in general being quite low. But I feel like at the end of the day I feel like I’m passing meds. I won’t be cocky and say I know everything though and I know there’s more to lean\n\nI know that my floor in the whole hospital system is regarded as the floor “I absolutely will not want to work in and that floor needs to be paid double” by floats and RTs. \n\nI don’t have a good baseline so I can’t say how legit that is or isn’t but I know in general it’s a tough high acuity unit. However I really like the staff we have here as a whole. Coming from my BMT unit the people here are very accepting of me and do not have issues with me not knowing things. I don’t feel like anyone looks at me odd. \n\nI shadowed at the NICU in our hospital and I was first concerned because in the interview the nurse educator specifically asked me why “as a MALE are you wanting to work in NICU and are you comfortable talking to women” which just throws me off a lot. Is this a general concern in NICU? Or am I being paranoid because of previous potential profiling?\n\nHowever the actual shadow was great. The turnover is very low with experienced staff (we have some nurses who are experienced with 10+ years but not much), I feel like all the questions I’m asking turn into understanding more physio which is something I love And in general I feel like I am critically thinking a lot more in a way that feels engaging. \n\nThe staff seemed friendly at least with the nurse I was shadowing and I didn’t feel like I had people looking at me in a very concerned way like I did in BMT. I like that the axillary staff is all there as well and i just feel like assessing feels more…engaging? I’m not sure how to explain it. \nAlso, from the nurses I talked to they said my current unit to nicu would be a much less hectic case load as well \n\nThe only thing I’m nervous on is being able to have the skills for IV placement, labs and whatnot because frankly I suck at it a LOT but I very rarely get the chance to try because our unit just has constant hard sticks even for the experienced nurses here. \n\nShould I take a plunge and go to NICU?",

    "text": "First code white… What could I have done better? I’m a new grad working in the ED and today I had my very first code white in the mental health unit of our emerg.\n\nPatient is a male in his 20s who was brought by police after assaulting a hotel worker (he was being kicked out as he hasn’t paid). No psych history. No known drug use aside from cannabis.\n\nHe was agitated with police when he came so we got him restrained and sedated with 10 mg Olanzapine IM. He seemed calm and cooperative afterwards (although his speech was pressured) - he let me interview him, do his blood work and his vitals. I let him know that if he cooperates we can slowly remove his restraints. I let him be downgraded to 3-point and monitored him for another hour or so.\n\n(I went for lunch at this time and my break partner actually said that the patient was asking to leave while I was away.)\n\nI come back to the room and I reminded him that he’s under involuntary admission and that if he does not work with us, we can restrain him back and even call police if he tries to escape. He was agreeable to the plan and since he was cooperative with 3-point restraint, we let him off the restraints completely.\n\nHe goes to the bathroom and gives me a urine sample. Then he asks if he could use a phone to make a call to his work. There were no phones in our secured mental health unit except for inside the nurses station so I tried to find a portable phone for him. When I couldn’t find one, I told him sorry but he couldn’t make a phone call at the time but I’m able to call for him.\n\nAll of a sudden he gets agitated and started asking to leave. I repeated that he’s held here involuntarily for a psych admission and that I have no authority over that. I reiterated that he will have to be restrained again if he is not compliant. His eyes looked like he was about to kill me. I suddenly could hear a threatening tone in his voice. He started walking off to the hallway so I took the opportunity to walk quickly back to the nurses station (it’s a locked area) as I had a bad gut feeling about him. As soon as I was about to open the door, I saw in the corner of my eye that he was about to run for me so I quickly tried to get the door closed but he managed to prop it open with me and security (we’re both smaller females) trying to push it closed. I manage to press the code white button on the wall and luckily, help came really fast and we were able to get him back on restraints.\n\nI feel traumatized right now, but more upset because my judgment call caused a dangerous situation. \n\nSo my question is, where did I go wrong? And what could I have done better in this situation?\n\nHow can I know if my patient is faking being cooperative? I feel like I’d have a hard time trusting MH patients now and would be scared to let people off restraints after this.\n\nPlease help…",

    "text": "Should I have gone to my manager? \nAITA? Nursing Orientation\n\nHello everyone! To start off, I am a nurse who works in a southern hospital and I finished my orientation around 7 months ago in the cardiac ICU. Recently, a new friend of mine - whom I will call Jane - started her orientation and I've heard positive things about her from numerous different experienced nurses. However, during her final couple days of orientation, she was paired with preceptor was upset about Jane's schedule potentially interfering with her own once off orientation. Despite there being no issues during the shift and Jane even asking for feedback, she was taken to the manager's office and told her orientation was going to be extended due to her lack of urgency. Completely blindsided by this, Jane was definitely hurt. Not only did the nurse cause the extension, but she did it behind her back after mentioning she did a good job. This decision was made by a \"night preceptor\" with only a year and a half of experience, while her original preceptor had over 30 years of experience. Jane continued her orientation with the night nurse, but I witnessed firsthand how the group of close-knit nurses treated her. The nightshift nurse singled Jane out in front of other nurses and the NP, making disparaging comments about her skills and abilities. I tried to help, but the preceptor loudly stated that she was trying to make Jane drown and if she needed anything she better get it herself. The following morning, the manager extended Jane's orientation again for another four weeks, bringing the total number of weeks to five. I felt like Jane was being bullied and sabotaged. I can’t even begin to imagine how it felt to be singled out like that specially since she is the only non-white person on the unit out of 30+ nurses. After asking James permission, I spoke privately to the manager on Jane's behalf, as I could not talk to the preceptor and make things worse for Jane.the manager seemed  angry at herself for prolonging Jane's orientation based on one person's opinion. Later on, the manager called Jane and asked what was really going on and she told her and the manager then paired Jane with a different preceptors schedule, and her orientation was shortened. Although I am glad everything worked out for Jane, I noticed that my co-workers were giving me the cold shoulder during my next shift. I anticipated their reaction and assumed they would know it was me but it still does not feel good to be ostracized by colleagues in an ICU where trust is imperative. Unfortunately, I too was treated poorly when I first came off orientation and said nothing about it. I’m not the type of person the go around someone’s back but I couldn’t stand to see this affect Jane so heavily anymore and I knew the target on her back wouldn’t go away if I didn’t speak up. Also for context, nurses pay on orientation is significantly less then when you are finished, so this situation not only affected Jane mentally but emotionally too. Can you please tell me if I was in the wrong for speaking up? AITA?",

    "text": "Left residency after 2 months feeling hopeless I applied and interviewed for both er and med surg and they gave me a observation unit.\n\nI ofcourse being a new grad immediately accepted what ever they would give me.\n\nThe education portion of the residency program was great but it seemed disconnected to the actual unit. They would say at the end of classes but its different in the cdu.\n\nI ran into a issue with one of the two preceptors I was scheduled with. This preceptor the first week would leave me alone with patients and take selfies in the nurses station. This preceptor also would intervene to quickly and micro manage every little thing because I did not do it exactly her way.  This was not the case with the other preceptor. \n\nAfter a patient needed immediate intervention they left me in the room alone said do this and when I finished they were talking with someone at the nurses station about dating apps mean while my patients bo had barely improved. \n\nI gave it a bit before I decided to report this preceptor because I have heard can be rough in the first year. But after continuously back tracking i. Progress between the better preceptor and this oen I finally reported them when they became extremely hostile when I asked questions.  \n\nThis was the start of the end. The whole unit turned on me. Attitudes changed the next day and this preceptor constantly was trying to push for why people were being pulled into meetings about it.\nI meet with this preceptor after a meeting with the ad of the er who over saw our unit. When I met with ber I just said I was meeting with the admin to find better ways for me to communicate my needs like setting up code words instead of having to just have her fix things for me or words I can say when I need help. \n\nShe only pries about what the meetings were. So I finally got tired of it and told her ot was a way for me to find a better way to communicate my needs when I see her rolling her eyes when I ask for help or yelling at me or leaving me in a room alone week one.\n\nObviously this preceptor was toxic and horrible and I requested not to be with her. Sadly that ruined everything l because then my schedule became terrible had random preceptors every day zero consistency in evaluation and never knew what I needed to work on until pulled into improvement meetings. 2 months i acter constantly communicating I want more feed back because what i hear on the floor and what the ad tells me are way different I requested a formal written eval not only word of mouth. \n\nIt was five lines of super general terms that honestly I already was doing. They held me from going from residency phase to orientation stating I am not ready for an independent load. \n\nThis is where I really realized there was a severe disconnect from the unit and the residency program. \n\nI would get told I am not doing meds correct but literally following written hospital policy. Dont get me wrong there were definitely things I needed improvement upon but they were the things all new frad nurses work on for the first year not ground for threat of termination or withholding  movement to orientation. More effective time management having a smoother more reflexed work flow. Things like that.\n\nMy unit would claim I am unsafe with meds xais eI would not reschedule a non critical med that was schedule daily exactly 24 hours from when last given. \n Or that my ic piggy back skills were lacking xause I didnt fill up the chamber exactly the way my preceptor wanted versus what hospital policy states. The preceptor would then say I was allowing deed back and I was too black and white. Keep in mind I would not tell the preceptor this is wwhat the policy state untill they told me I was doinf it incorrectly and that is what they would report to the ad to prevent me from advancing to orientation. \n\nI came fo realize the whole situation as pure lateral violence and bullying and even the educators in the residency program didnt lien what was going on.\n\nI quit after two months when I realized there was no way to actually do right for my one primary preceptor and my ad told me it was purely his blessing that allowed my to continue. \n\nNow I am scared shitless and being told I should have stayed. ZI am the sole provider for my family and a day later I have already applied elsewhere. \n\nI feel like there is zero chance of getting into any hospital positions now and that I will be stick with low pay out patient situations. My girl friend felt like i should have applied else where while working but sadly one option I thought I had fell through \n\nAny feed back or discussion is highly welcome and would be appreciated.",

    "text": "Was I wrong for not yelling at my orientee? So, I work in nursing home as an RN and I have an orientee this week. He is an LPN and he is a very fast learner. I talked with him about his previous work and he is actually a new nurse like me (finished last year). Now, you're probably wondering why a new nurse is training a new nurse. Well, they're desperate as hell. That is why. Anyway, this is his first job in a facility. His previous experience has been solely homecare. As you can imagine, it is quite a culture shock moving from having 1 patient to now having 20 but he is doing well, when this happened today. \n\nOne of the long-term female residents who never gave me an issue (also a male nurse), gave my orientee such a tough time. She is not 100% alert. She is MOSTLY alert but she has a lot of emotional/behavioral issues so she will often cry suddenly over something then stop. Or she would have a yelling match one minute and be calm the next. But she knows what she is saying/doing and is aware of her actions. She was calling him racial slurs, mocking him when he would talk to me, tell him he is worthless, etc. while we are in there trying to do her dressing change and I am showing him how to do it while she's interrupting him with insults whenever he says something. She wouldn't even let him touch her. She let me do the dressing change while he observed and handed me supplies. I told her that he is a nurse in training and he has demonstrated great skill while I have been with him. She still continued to attack him.  \n\nSuddenly, she started crying out of nowhere saying she is all alone and nobody visits her. So, my orientee took this as an opportunity to chime in. \"Well, no wonder nobody wants to visit you. You're a miserable person.\" She cried even harder and said she was gonna report him for that. He replied with \"Go right ahead, ma'am.\" and exited the room. I did not say anything to her while I was in there alone and I did not make an effort to console her crying either. She was telling me how mean the new nurse was, how he shouldn't work here, blah blah blah. I just finished what I was doing and said \"Call me if you need anything.\" before I left. \n\nI went over to my orientee, who was by the med-cart, and told him that I was on his side and how she treated him was not right. He said how it was a \"new\" experience for him as he has never dealt with a difficult patient like that before and usually is able to remain professional but he \"could not bite his tongue\". I, again, told him that he is only human and it was a reflexive statement. We talked about it a bit more and moved onto the other residents. Maybe about 2 hours later, the unit manager approaches me and says she has a complaint from a resident regarding my orientee. She told me what the resident told her and I told her how she communicated to my orientee. She asked me \"Did you educate (aka yell at) your orientee for his response?\" And I said \"No, I am on his side because of how dehumanizing she talked to him as a new nurse.\" She had said that even though the resident's demeanor was negative, that doesn't mean you stoop to that level, and I do agree with what she said but at the same time I understand why my orientee said what he said. \n\nWould I have lost my cool like that on a patient? No, but I have also had experience dealing with difficult patients early on. My first ever patient in clinical called me a \"skinny white fag\". As a gay man, I wanted to defend myself naturally but I did bite my tongue and remained cool. I also worked customer service before nursing and dealt with a lot of meanies there too. I don't regret not \"educating\" my orientee on how he responded. I just wonder how you would've handled it if this happened to your orientee and they lost their cool on the patient.  Whether you'd yell at them or stand up for them, I'm curious on your approach.",

One teacher (white woman) was specifically told that she \"doesn't understand the culture of the children (title one school, mostly African American)\" to which she reminded them that she is engaged to a black man and has a mixed race child. They didn't respond to that either and basically the teachers were told if they are ever heard saying it again, they would be fired. \n\nI tried searching this claim and found something about how it's equivalent to telling kids to \"shut up\", but even that seems like a stretch.

I'm at a rural, low income, high risk, predominantly black school (the last part shouldn't matter, but I'll explain.) I was warned by hr when I was hired that the kids have behavioral issues and to reach out if I wasn't being supported. \n\nIn my first week, there were multiple fights in my class. One student threw a chair at my screen board. The students actively told me they were trying to get me fired, would lie to the admin, and were misbehaving to get me to quit. Of course, I told them that wasn't going to leave and to cut it out so we can learn. \n\nOver the month, most of the students have calmed down. Some enjoy my class and are actually learning. About a third are still being rambunctious. They curse in class, bully other students, don't do their work, refuse to sit in their assigned seat, still throw things. There's been multiple fights in my class too. Another teacher asked one of those students why they only act this way in my class and not for any other teacher. He responded \"because you're black\". (I'm the only white teacher in the grade).\n\nI'm also having issues with their IEPs. The SPED teacher hasn't been following their accommodations so most of those kids are failing. Yet I'm suppssed to provide read aloud accomodations to a student who doesn't have an iep. I have referred this student for evaluation twice and have been ignored. I also had to restrain a student with a 504 because she was charging at another student to fight them. I reported my use of restraint, but the administration didn't report it to the state as required. \n\nI've told admin all of this as it has happened. I've asked for disciplinary policies and procedures for when kids are being violent multiple times. The admin hasn't been able to provide any direction besides call the parents. Well I do that and it does nothing. The parents say they'll discipline, but they come right back doing the same stuff the next day. (BTW, our class phones don't have outbound call access. I have to use my personal phone...).\n\nThe admin scheduled a meeting with me this week saying I need to learn how to manage my classroom because writing 10 referrals a week is bad. I explained everything above again and asked again for assistance in doing that by receiving written policies and procedures. They claimed this was there first time hearing about it (lie) and provided nothing.\n\nThey said I need to have better lesson plans that engage the students every minute. I offered to pull up my lesson plans to show them that is done. I also explained that we haven't been able to complete the activities I do plan because of the behavioral issues. \n\nThey proceeded to tell me that they didn't have these issues before I got here, basically saying these kids are violent because of me. I reminded them that the kids have said they don't respect me because of my race and are trying to get me fired. The conversation continued to revolve around how poorly I'm doing. I reminded them that I am an emergency provisional, untrained, uncertified teacher and that I need support. \n\nEverything I suggested was given a no. We don't have security to call. I can't call the police. I can't send disruptive kids to the hall. I can't give them worksheets to keep them occupied. They refuse to suspend kids and if they do it's not for more than a day. ISS is usually only used for that class period and they return for the next. \n\nIs this normal? Admin tried to tell me this is how it is at every school and I need to just get used to it. \n\nI truthfully don't know what to do. I enjoy my job. The \"good\" students enjoy my class. The other teachers tell me I'm doing a great job. \n\nI can't stop thinking about how they are blaming me for the violence. These are long standing behavioral issues that are happening in every grade at the school. If the worst were to happen, a school shooting imo, I have no way to get help. I wouldn't be able to live with the fact that the adults blame me for the violence. \n\nI'm not sure what to do and I need advice. I can reach out to HR, but that will strain my relationship with admin more. I'm planning on sending a recap email of the meeting with my questions about procedures in writing. I make good money, but the districts closer to my family are paying more...\n\nShould I look elsewhere? Should I try to make this work? Should I escalate to HR? I truly don't know how to handle this.",

    "text": "How to deal with entitled parents? I teach 4th in a Title 1 school. I would've never expected so much parent entitlement from this school setting, but this year most of my prep time has been spent dealing with student issues and demanding parents (and it's always the rich white parents who are in the minority at my predominantly Black school). It almost feels as though I'm punished for telling these parents anything contrary to the idea that their sweet little baby is perfect and can do no wrong. For example, I set up a meeting with a parent because I noticed a decline in a student's work. Mom reacted with anger, was skeptical of MY teaching, threatened to go to my principal, and is now emailing every day or every few days asking for \"data to back up the interventions I have put in place.\" With another kid, I wrote home to tell them that he said several insulting things to another kid (\"Your mom is fat,\" \"your writing is stupid,\" etc.) and they said that their son claims he didn't say those things and I'm lying. I'm now receiving texts from this mom twice daily asking for updates on her precious baby and what I'm doing to \"help him feel less fearful in the classroom.\" I'm feeling really discouraged and angry because I put in so much work in the first half of the year to cultivate strong relationships with students and families. Then, one small issue arises, and suddenly I'm considered a liar, a bad teacher, and someone who is out to get their kid. It almost feels as though it would have been easier to not report any issues home and just pretend everything is fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's worse, it would be somewhat manageable if this was one parent, but I have 4-5 parents who are this demanding. I really cannot handle this many parents demanding my time every single day.

    "text": "Disrespectful student I have a 7th grader in my specialized math class (a class with students who are at 3rd/4th grade math level with many learning/intellectual disabilities, but they’re still in general classrooms the rest of the day). This 7th grader has autism, and is somewhat in the high-functioning range. He also has behavior problems not suitable for the classroom some days. He has access to BMC (a behavior management classroom) to “cool off” attitude, anger, etc.\n\nYesterday, we worked together on white boards. Each kid had a personal whiteboard, marker and eraser. Before I handed them out, I told them the expectations I have when they use these items. Throughout the lesson, he was constantly drawing on the whiteboard which isn’t allowed for this activity. He was also smashing in the tip of the marker onto the whiteboard, which ruined the marker. I took away those items and then gave him paper and pencil. He gave me big attitude because I took it away, and said “I’m going to tell my mom what you did, and you’re going to get in trouble.”\n\nWhatever, kid.\n\nI emailed his mom later on yesterday explaining the situation, and she said she would have a talk with him after school. It was a pleasant email. She even said she would bring some dry erase markers and whiteboards that she doesn’t use at her house!\n\nToday, we were doing the same type of activity with the same materials. Before this, I called this student outside the room to have a chat about expectations and rules for using my classroom materials. He didn’t say anything and rolled his eyes at me. In the middle of class, he started giving me attitude when I told him I needed him to show some work and participate (he is smart enough to know some of the answers I was asking as I’ve seen him show me before). At one point, I had enough with him and the attitude and disrespect because it was distracting the rest of the class (friends who were snickering when the boy was talking back to me), so I sent him to BMC.\n\nWhen I called down to BMC, the teacher got snippy with me asking why I sent him down for this situation, that I should’ve sent him to the office. Well, isn’t that room a place for the kid to cool down his attitude?!?! It’s in his IEP!!! \n\nWas I in the wrong for sending him down instead of to the vice principal’s office?? What are some options I can do to handle this student in the future. I feel like I’ve tried everything!\n\n\nTL;DR 7th grade boy with behavior problems, attitude, disrespect - today was sent down to behavior management classroom to cool off. BMC teacher frustrated that i sent him there instead of the office…I’ve tried everything with this kid, but nothing is working. What can I do??",

    "text": "Get help if this is you (Apologies, it's a bit of a long post)\n\nFor the first nine years of my career in education, I burned myself out every single year. Every year it just got worse and worse, and I knew I could expect a nervous breakdown every year; especially in the third term (the worst term for final year high school students). The pile of marking kept getting the best of me, I just couldn't manage to get everything done on time and to a satisfactory standard. Because I was clearly not coping, I’ve been looking for an opportunity to change careers.\n\nLast December I checked into a mental health clinic and started my mental health journey. I was finally diagnosed with ADHD and OCPD (an awful combination) at the age of 36. At last I got help. It wasn't an easy journey; it took four tries to get a medication that worked with three different therapists!\n\nThe drastic improvement it's brought about in my life, especially with regards to marking, cannot be overstated. It's as if I finally have a say in what my brain and body needs to do, now I’m not being led around seeing all things bright, shiny and interesting. Before, I was unable to mark unless I got into some magical hyperfocus state (now I know the name for it), which I only managed to get into LATE at night. Consequently, I was never able to mark during the week. It was a disaster; I would try, but I just couldn't focus enough to get going. I kept getting sidetracked with new and interesting projects or tasks. Procrastivity (productivity as a form of procrastination) is a real thing! For the first time in years, I am able to decide when and where to work, and the stream of thoughts popping into my head, are finally quiet. My ability to prioritise has also drastically improved.\n\nOCPD is a compulsive personality type where one is ruled by an absolute dread at ever making a mistake, and a steadfast belief that you are the only one doing it right, everyone else simply has an awfully poor work ethic. Getting a better understanding of that, has also made an enormous difference in my marking speed. Now everything doesn't have to be black or white, I am finally comfortable with a bit of grey. I am so sorry for the criticism and pride I have displayed towards others all these years, when I have been the one with a problem.\n\nI am so thankful for the journey God has taken me on. Character development isn't a pleasant process, and waiting so long to get the right help has been a nightmare. If He didn't carry me through these past years, I would probably not be here anymore. Thankfully, through countless divine appointments, conversations, closed doors and other open ones, I now have an answer, and I'm in a completely different place in my life. \n\nFor the first time (in my 10th year of being a teacher) I have managed to finish my marking on time, and I will have my first ever mid-year school holiday. \n\nIf anything in this post has resonated with you, know that you are not alone. You are not the only one not coping, you do not need to be ashamed. Get help, it is out there!",

I'm super stoked to be teaching English, litcrit and storytelling to mostly black middle schoolers in NYC. I've taught this age group and subject matter before in a volunteering context and I'm looking forward to empowering these kids thru reading and writing as some of my favorite English teachers have done for me. However, I'm unsure if I will be effective.\n\nI'm afraid that I won't be able to connect with these kids. A lot of this stems from insecurities i have about being \"black enough\". I grew up in the mostly black suburbs of Philly, ive attended Catholic schools with varying levels of white kids and my family is solidly middle class Afro Carribbean. Many of these kids have lived in the projects, experience issues w food insecurity, homelessness, sexual abuse and police violence/incarceration. I'm not saying this to be a savior or look down on them, as I understand they cant help the structural issues that created their environment. However, I acknowledge even if we share skin color - black narratives are not a monolith. What's more, I'm generally very quiet and I don't like conflict, so I'm unsure how to do classroom management without seeming like a tyrant or a pushover, especially since rules for conduct are generally more lax in public school.\n\nI'm very committed to combatting anti blackness in schools and understand the importance of black educators as a way to inspire young people. However, I feel scared that the kids may see me as uppity, an Oreo or otherwise out of touch.",

I'd be super grateful for any friendly advice or suggestions on how to tackle this with positivity and good vibes.\n\nHere's a snapshot of the situation:\n\n- While a few attentive students are present, many tend to be easily distracted.\n\n- They're so excited to start \"playing\" that they sometimes overlook the rules of the game.\n\n- This leads to instances of rule-breaking, followed by finger-pointing, as they haven't fully grasped the rules.\n\n- Touch rugby lessons can become a bit chaotic, with students hesitating to admit when they've been tagged and resorting to little white lies.\n\nI'm trying to find the best way to address this issue and teach the students the importance of following rules and fair play. Additionally, I want to create a positive, inclusive, and fun environment for everyone involved.\n\nIf you've encountered similar situations or have any suggestions on how to approach this with kindness and understanding, please share your thoughts and advice.

    "text": "How to defend students against new principal Hi everyone,\n\nAfter 8 years of teaching in a district with a principal who was manipulative and emotionally abusive to her staff, my wife and I (both teachers) moved to a new district further north.  The first year was awesome, but the principal, who had been there for 20 years, retired after I'd only been there for one.  The new lady they brought in (no admin experience, coming from a correctional school in Florida) has been a problem.  Mostly, it's just been run-of-the-mill incompetence, but there have been a few issues (lack of respect to transgender students, elimination of a \"sensory overload\" table for kids with IEPs at lunch, etc.) that have really been red flags.  The worst happened in my wife's class yesterday.\n\nWe have been experiencing a heat wave and our school (being about 5 miles from Canada) was not built with A/C.  A student in my wife's class, with known emotional issues, wore tanktop, which for the most part seemed to be in line with our dress code, but apparently was a little too short? (I'm honestly not sure of the justification here. Maybe because it was white?)\n\nAnyway, our principal barged into the room in the middle of class and demanded the student put on a sweatshirt.  The student (who has come SUCH A LONG WAY in managing her behavior and sees my wife's room as a safe space) refused.  The principal continued until it became a shouting match and the student was taken from class and sent home early, undoing a year's work on getting this student to stay in class, manage her anger, and persevere.  We were flabbergasted. What can be done when it's your boss who isn't putting the students first?  She's come in and mostly focused on being a disciplinarian (which wasn't REALLY needed) and has alienated and enraged the student body.  We have a union that protects us teachers, but who do we contact to protect students from this?",

    "text": "First Year Teacher - frustrated, looking to prevent repeat Hi, I am a first-year (in the USA) teacher, though I have some experience overseas. When I taught in Asia, it was by and large a dream. I loved it, my students adored me, and came back to the US for my Master's in education. I am endorsed in ELA and social studies. This year I started at a middle school in a rural district teaching 7th and 8th grade.\n\nTo say it has been a rough year would be an understatement. My admin is just woefully inconsistent. She started off saying, \"Students think you're too strict; be nicer and build relationships!\" So I backed off and became \"nicer,\" using a lot of positive language. She particularly got upset because students were coming to her claiming they were being targeted because of their race, which made me feel *awful*. She at one point tells me, \"You absolutely cannot discipline any minority kids. They are complaining.\" (the principal, for reference, is white and had previously only taught in richer, overwhelmingly white schools) Come to find out later that it's actually her a lot of parents are calling \"racist.\" Then she comes back and says, \"You must be stricter and hold students accountable!\" after literally telling me, word for word, not to discipline them two months ago (predictably, the class went off the rails). Then, the first week when I do what she tells me to and send six kids to detention, she complains that I'm over-disciplining them.\n\nBonus: Early in second semester she pulled me aside to say a kid had made a hate page of me on Instagram, taking sexualized pictures of me in class (mostly zoomed in on my butt and profile). This was not the first incident of sexual harassment with the student; the two previous incidents, involving comments and assignments in class, had resulted in a \"talk\" and a promise that the student would change. The student was suspended for two days; I asked that the student  be put in the class that had para support so they could be supervised. She agreed; however, at the parent meeting, the mom starts actually screaming at me that I have had it in for her kid for months. Principal does nothing to defend me, and she and another admin tried to persuade me to put that student back in the same class as before with no extra supervision. I refused, and went to the union. She got angry, and at that point, colleagues were telling me I should be prepared for nonrenewal, just in case.\n\nBy February, I had serious mental health battles that drove me to go to several doctors; each one of them told me, \"The problem is your job.\" However, worried about getting penalized (and also financial security), I knew I needed to stay and finish out the year. I've done my very best, but the classroom management that had things running like a well-oiled machine in Asia simply doesn't work here; working in a small town means being an outsider can be tough; 8th graders in the lowest-paid district in the area have seen teachers come and go, and are not very open; and the principal herself offers some help but very inconsistently (she'll say she'll pull a kid for repeated racist and abusive language in class, and then just...forget and be unavailable, while the kid refuses to leave and continues abuse). Obviously, I put in my end-of-year resignation the week before spring break and lined up references, and I'm currently looking for jobs.\n\nI'm just trying to get through the last few weeks at this point, and doing my best for the kids. However,  classroom management has deteriorated as kids near the end of the year and her inconsistent policies remain unworkable. Today, I had kids making a fuss about something that they \"heard\" as a swear word but was actually completely not, and things got loud and bothered another class, which I feel awful about.  I feel burnt-out and not as willing to put in the energy to make my lessons amazing. I have to be medicated in order to finish the year.\n\nSorry for the novel, but my question is this: Is this normal? And also: How do I prevent it from happening next year? What should I do differently?",

For the past 3 years I have managed to avoid all of the heinous inflation by living in a shithole part of Texas making \"good money\" for the area. After a nervous breakdown I was going back to school and looking for work while living with family.\n\nI finally managed to find a job in Seattle making 20 an hour and its just not possible to budget rent into the mix with all of my other finances (Car, insurance, groceries, medical insurance/doctors visits etc.) because at the end of the month I have 60 bucks leftover for \"savings\". Even after trying to tighten the belt and adjust spending, and I'm talking rice and beans and cheap protein style food budget, I still only come up with 300 a month in savings.\n\nNow the schooling I got was in healthcare and there is a strike in San Diego that I can go and make 75 an hour plus overtime for a few weeks and make 6-8k in that time which will give me a nice safety net of six months to look for a higher paying job (Which I've been doing for the last 6 months).

Would I be a ginormous flaming piece of shit for crossing a picket line, or is it justified for my survival?\n\nEDIT: To say that crossing the picket would be temporary, as would the contract. I would not be crossing to take the job over entirely, and would not be permanently relocating. The company would pay for me to show up and work and leave after 2 weeks or if the strike ends early and will be paid for any missed work just not at the same rate. I also currently live in Seattle, which is where my family lives and I am living with them. \n\nAnd final request to all of the white knighters and those calling me a piece of shit, what would you do to come up with the rent and utilities to not be homeless?",

But for the entirety of my career every salary \"negotiation\" at my company has been with my manager (or a hiring manager if I'm changing jobs internally), the manager then says \"HR comes up with the compensation number, but if you're unhappy with it *I can talk to them for you*\". I am personal friends with managers at my company, and I do know they're not lying about how the process works. But I think this is a huge farce, I realized today I have *never* had a direct conversation with a person with control over my pay. Even my direct HR manager says that a \"compensation team\" is responsible for my pay. \n\nIn an irony to my company, this realization was the result of a recent transparency initiative in salary decisions, they shared the inputs to the salary equation which are time on job and cumulative performance score, and then there's a salary range for job type. I am very happy to learn about this, it's also disgusting to see them make it plainly clear that there's not *really* room for salary negotiation.

TL;DR - If you’re able to get away with it, shitposting on LinkedIn is fun! \n\nSome time ago, I signed up for a new alt LinkedIn profile with an old alt email, gave myself a fake but real-sounding name, filled it up with a work history of all my old shitty retail/restaurant big brands jobs from when I was a teenager, gave myself a Head Manager of Blahblahblah bullshit position at a company I made up, and used a pic from Does This Person Exists. \n\nThen I just started connecting with random people who accepted my invites and that ended up tapping into this network of People I May Know who just all accept invites from each other and before long, I had like 3x as many connections than my real goddam LinkedIn. I try to be genuinely supportive of the people I’m connected to when they have career wins. I like their promotions and raises and new jobs and I comment “go person go!” I also follow the brand pages of nonprofits and food banks and libraries and parks and Planned Parenthood and the ACLU and other causes I support and give them all the likes and loves their meager-ass marketing teams deserve. And I guess that seems to generate goodwill in terms of engaging the LinkedIn algorithms?\n\n I also post r/antiwork and r/workreform content and screenshots, as well as socialist and anti-capitalist takes and memes, and share articles about union wins from major media outlets. Also, tons of brands and companies across all industries advertise to show up in my feed, and I’m always commenting with something pro-people. I’ve learned there’s always at least one person in marketing or whatever fucking department they’re in paying attention to the comments and being tagged, so that shit gets noticed and read by someone in corporate, if not responded to. \n\nIf some conglomerate corporate brand page shares a photo of a bunch of old C-Suite white men, I tag the brand page and comment and ask if they employ any POC or women. If they advertise for internships, I ask how much are they paying. If healthcare and insurance brands advertise on my feed touting their services, I tag that brand’s page and ask why we do not have free healthcare for all. If someone says “wow Elon Bezos zomg genius” I select the laugh option — which is surprisingly available on LinkedIn and should be used a whole lot more often for all these goddam sycophantic “attaboy boss!” comments there are. Sometimes I even push back on sycophantic takes that “thought leaders” provide but then I end up actually getting some surprisingly earnest and thoughtful “you’re not wrong” kind of responses, so on a super micro level, there is potential for this kind of message to get more attention on the one social media platform it probably matters the most on. \n\nI tried to replicate this with a brand-new email and suddenly LinkedIn starting asking me to verify my identity in ways that I am not comfortable with at all and will not even be fucking doing for my real profile, so using LinkedIn to post anonymously may not work for everyone. And most of us have jobs and bosses that we’re already sensitive enough about sharing TMI on any kind of social media. But if you’re in a secure place professionally and you aren’t afraid to use your voice to speak out on issues you care about on Facebook with your real name, then maybe using LinkedIn with your real name to speak out would be more productive. Tagging Elon Bezos won’t do anything, but finding out the names of C-Suite and VP suits and tagging them on LinkedIn can be an easy way to get their attention, if not their reaction.\n\nSometimes I’m just flat-out shit-posting I Hate Mondays memes in the comments of corporate  just to amuse myself and I have definitely been kicked off from posting and tagging certain brands as they learn how to use blocking tools they’ve probably never had to use until my jerk ass came along. Still, folks are for now engaging with me and looking at my profile. It’s probably only a matter of time before I’m reported to high up enough by some good lil capitalist rat fink tool and then kicked off by the LinkedIn police forevermore but in the meantime, I can’t help wonder if as an active user with 1000+ connections, I’m too valuable in engagement points for LinkedIn so I’ve had a longer leash? idk. \n\n It’s so goddam weird because if you are on LinkedIn and you call yourself the Head Manager of Blahblahblah at the company you made up and you say things, people will listen to you, so bugging the shit out of specific big wheels high up in corporate can absolutely create real tangible micro changes — like tagging the name of the head of HR on a brand’s sponsored post and pointing out any lack of alt text in their images for that post — and asking hard important questions in the comments section of big brands has the non-zero potential to push anyone who is listening a lil closer to the message. \n\nLinkedIn could be very ripe for more of this kind of pro-worker voice to take hold because companies are not used to any kind of engagement on LinkedIn that isn’t sycophantic. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nTL;DR - If you’re able to get away with it, shitposting on LinkedIn is fun!",

    "text": "Happy Birthday, You Broke Loser: a brief commentary on dumb little work “incentives.” \n*Congratulations on being with the company for 5 years! Here’s a ballpoint pen worth $2 with our name on it, to show how much we appreciate your years of dedication.*\n\nI could use a raise.\n\n*We made more this quarter than all of last year combined! To share the wealth, upper management has sprung for… a pizza party!!! Be sure not to take more than two slices so everyone can have some.*\n\nI mean, I could *really* use a fuckin raise.\n\n*Our essential workers really risked their lives and the lives of their families to keep society running for us for two years, to acknowledge their sacrifice and the stress they lived through, here’s a stress ball with one of our corporate sponsor’s logos on it that we dug out from storage, plus a tiny pack of six whole haribo gummy bears.*\n\nHow much is a human life worth? What if we broke it down into hours, how much is each hour of a human life really worth?\n\n#*Sigh…*\n\nI already don’t like my job and am trying to get something lined up so I can leave. The hiring process was basically a scam, I got bait and switched, essentially. *I shouldn’t even be here today!!* But they just keep showing how little of a fuck they give about their staff. \n\nFor example; when that crazy Christmas storm hit North America and everywhere from Austin to Edmonton was wallowing in frosty white bullshit, our entire city basically shut down because despite being a major Canadian city they have a Fijian snow removal budget. The bus/metro system was advising everyone not to travel and cancelled most of their routes. Taxis and Ubers were entirely unable to move and alongside all other drivers were being advised by the city and law enforcement to stay off the roads. Work sent out an email telling everyone to leave early to get to work on time. They had a number for you to call to let them know if you’d be delayed, but didn’t make calling out an option. It took one of my coworkers eight hours to get home one of those nights. (It’s a hotel, btw, they could put staff up if they chose to, but fuck us.)\n\nAnyway, onto dumb incentives, sorry for the rant tangent. They say they give out gift cards for birthdays. My birthday comes and goes, I never expect work to do anything for that stuff so idc. But two weeks late they actually remember, and I got a card. (Had a message from the one HR lady but signed by no one else.) A Starbucks card inside. Not the kind that say $5 or $15 but the charge up kind. Nowhere is written how much the card is worth. \n\nOne coworker insists his was $15. Two other coworkers say no, it would be $5. it’s always $5. I went to use it today to find out.\n\nGuess how much was on the card?\n\n$0.\n\nGave it back to my manager and he’s like “can’t you activate it?” Like… you mean by putting MY OWN money on it? That’s not a gift dude. \n\nAnyway it’s such a small and stupid thing all I can do is laugh. It means so little and yet… maybe that’s the problem with these dumb little attempts jobs make to get “personal” and be a “family” with the underpaid staff. How about giving me the hours and pay you promised me? That would show your appreciation. \n\nWhat’s the dumbest little “incentive” you’ve gotten or heard of someone getting?\n\nOthers of mine from previous jobs:\n\n- Company t shirts (the gift of being unpaid advertising, thanks a lot)\n- A grab pile of “sponsor swag” basically a pile of too-small stress balls and too-hard erasers with various insurance provider logos stamped all over them that upper management got from free booths at a seminar\n- The fabled monthly box of break room donut holes, 50% of which are the kind nobody likes\n- Paltry discounts on things staff should get for free (staff meals at restaurants etc)\n- Competition bonuses, so whoever does the most [X] gets the bonus and no one else gets anything even if everyone goes above and beyond and earns their own bonus, resulting in the company making loads of extra money without having to pay more than one staff member for the entire team’s collective extra effort.",

    "text": "It's my turn! I make 2$ less than my coworker and have for years Hey all! Long time lurker, big fan of the movement and I finally have my very own story about unequal pay and I'd love some advice about what to do. \n\nIronically, I didn't find this out until today due to getting a raise. I work in home health and I am paid \"per unit\" the rate per unit that I was hired at is $45 per unit. I've been with the company since 2019 and I've never had any bad performance reviews or anything like that. My raise has raised me to $48 per unit which originally made me very happy, but of course the story doesn't end there. I have a co-worker who was also a classmate of mine in the same school program, we literally graduated together. The only difference between us is that I am a white male and she is a white female. When I got informed of my raise, I reached out to her out of concern that I was getting a raise above her because I am a fair-minded individual and being a white male I was somewhat concerned I'd be making more than her. Surprisingly to both of us, she was originally hired at a rate of $47 per unit and now has been raised to $50 per unit. We got the same raise ($3), but she's been making more than me the entire time! (Note: I do want to reiterate we LITERALLY graduated from the same school, same class, so there is absolutely no difference in workplace experience, so this is not a factor with this wage increase. She was technically hired before me but still within the same year as me, earlier in 2019. This is also not our first job and we've both worked at different places before this, so very similar levels of experience.) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately this is where it gets a little complicated. Upon discovering this and knowing that I would be talking to my manager about it, my coworker got very nervous and said she would much rather I not disclose that she shared her pay with me (neither of us expected that she'd be making more, if anything we expected the opposite). Our local branch is a small part of a big company and the only two full timers in the same position are me and her. If I say \"it's come to my attention that payrate is variable here and I am paid less than coworkers in the same position\" it is immediatley obvious that I'm referring to her which immediately makes it apparent we discussed our raise+wages. I live in Virginia and it is supposed to be illegal for employers to penalize employees for sharing wages but we all know that doesn't necessarily work. The biggest issue is my co-worker has not consented to me sharing her wage increase since she is worried it'll reflect back on her if I say anything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWithout the context that she's been making more than me from the start, it is hard to make any argument that my raise is insufficient. I received the exact same raise as my coworker, it is just that my overall rate is lower and has been since I started. Of course I've learned my lesson and should I have to move on then I'll know to discuss my wages front and center in the future. \n\nLastly, I want to say despite this discrepancy in pay, I really do love my job. I enjoy the work, I have a good reputation with my coworkers, I am fairly well established here and I know I'm going to get a lot of comments saying \"dump that place asap and find a new workplace\". If I absolutely have to I will but I really am happy here except for this development so I am reluctant to do so. I will also say that my manager is not a particularly nasty person or anything like that, she is also not the original person that hired me so she might not even be expressedly aware that I was hired at a lower rate. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice or tips are welcome! Again I live in Virginia if that helps at all. Thank you all so much.",

    "text": "Afraid to File a HR Complaint I know this isn't typical \"work reform\", but I feel like it's something that deserves more attention here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWarning: Long tl;dr at bottom \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a white male, CISHET presenting human. (I'm fairly pansexual) I am currently working as a mountain bike trail builder for a small town, and it's a job I absolutely adore. This is true for my winter role as well. The problem is that in the summer, I loathe many my coworkers. It didn't take long to realize that I just didn't want to interact with them because of their topic of conversation, and the \"know-it-allness\" of one of them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo it all came to a head the other day when I expressed my opinion of what the next work on the trails should be. And the Know-it-all guy rolled his eyes as if to say \"oh look at the dumbass speaking\". This when he hasn't been on our trails all summer due to injury, and every day we go to perform the work he keeps telling the bosses we should do, having a reason not to help. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I called him on it by saying \"Could you not? Especially if you're not going to come help string trim?\" And he fucking blew up at me \"Why, I could string trim circles around you!\" Yeah, I don't really care, it's irrelevant. He continues to lash out and act a fool, even saying I'm the cause for all the problems on the team. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStatistically, he's right. In a later team meeting I mentioned my being the outsider of the group, and that's okay with me. I always have been. (Two of them and a boss work together on a different winter job, and the other guy has worked with them for years.) I have various examples of this being true, and was told then by one of them \"that's not how it works here, you're not the outside person, you're not a victim.\" or something of this sort. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI even mentioned to my boss that when I realized their conversation topics were not things I want to talk about, I just stepped out of them. He then proceeded to ask me if that was the best thing to do, placing the blame on me. Here's the conversation topics:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis girl they had nicknamed \"solar eclipse\" because she was under 18 and you can't look at her. Now that she's turned 18, she's referred to as \"Lunar\" and they gawk more openly. Kinda like when Emma Watson was turning 18 and people essentially had countdowns for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey spend much of their time talking shitty about, or making fun of people when they're not around said person. Even those they claim to be friends with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have heard many times the valuation of women according to the size of their tits. Or rather, the only characteristics I hear about women from these men are bodily characterists. And of course one of them who is about to be a father is the typical \"I have to protect my daughter from men\" types, which is to say he feels he needs to protect her from people like himself and his friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey still call things they don't like \"gay\". They refer to some traits of humans, derogatorily, as \"woman\" or \"female\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd you can most certainly, according to them, judge the quality of a Mexican restaurant according to \"little abeualitas in the  kitchen.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, and they also leave their work trucks idling when mowing large lawns for an hour or two at a time so they can get into a cold truck when they're done. Even when it's parked next to the climate controlled building our team office is in.  Or when they go into the store for minutes at a time, or gather implements for the day from storage, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFuck this drives me nuts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's a team of five. I only get along with one of them. And since the foreman is on a winter crew with two of them as EMTs at a different job, he's probably not going to support me in this, either. He's too close to the problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe boss/manager litterally just sat there while the dude raged at me, and him, about me being the problem with the team, because no one challenged them then. (I've only directly done so twice.) So he's not really capable of being quality help, and spent his time explaining to me that he hired people for their strengths, and thus doesn't focus on their weaknesses. Weaknesses such as laziness, being an argumentative know-it-all, etc. I was also told that if someone is causing problems and can't work as a team member, he has no reason to invite them back for the next season. Which I'm guessing is me, the guy who's waiting to be screened for Autism and ADHD. Cause it's true, I'm the burr under the saddle, and against sexism/racism/homophobia like this, I'm okay with being the odd person out until it makes my life miserable in a place it shouldn't. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is no way there won't be retaliation if I take this to HR. I see no way it will get smoothed over, either. Because I just don't tolerate this sort of shit and don't want to be around it. So by removing myself from it, I'm accused of \"having a shitty attitude.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it's not like they wouldn't hide all this in front of women, or Mexicans, or gay people.  The bosses don't see it, and I do because I'm sort of out in the field with them. And it's not just them. I hear this bullshit in my locker room at the other job, particularly during our Pride week. One guy even talked about how stupid and illogical women are while I was, ironically, on the phone with my partner who is a professor. And if I file a complaint, it's basically the equivalent of dropping an armed hand grenade in the room while they're wearing body armor and I'm not. I really don't know what to do. Especially without putting my winter role at this job in jeopardy, when this crew isn't around and I get along with everyone because they aren't like this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr I work with a bunch of men who only talk about women according to physical characteristics, judge Mexican restaurants by \"the little abeualitas\" in the kitchen, and spend a lot of time talking shit about their \"friends\" behind their backs, and letting truck engines idle for hours a day. I removed myself from these interactions, and have had to defend myself a couple times, and am accused of having a shitty attitude and being the source of all friction from the team. But if I take it to HR, there is no way there won't be retaliation, and it might cost me ability to work a labor service I really love providing for the community. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just needed somewhere a bit to rant. Maybe to get some insight.",

    "text": "How do I recover from learning that a new, inexperienced employee was immediately given the same salary that I have spent years trying to earn for myself? I (34F) have worked at a nonprofit arts organization for 5 years. I started as an administrative volunteer while finishing my masters degree, was hired as an administrative assistant, and have slowly worked my way into middle management. I love what I do, the mission of the organization, and most of the people I work with. We are still recovering financially from the Covid shutdowns but we're on an upward trajectory. I received my last raise in April 2022 and haven't had any adjustment in salary since then because money has been tight for the organization. I would like to make more money, but ultimately I care about the organization and I'm getting by ok so the specific dollar amount doesn't matter too much to me as long as I can pay my bills.  \n\n\nMy personal shake-up came last week when I accidentally discovered that a new employee (27M) who just started in June of this year was elevated to the same salary as me after only 3 months on the job. (This was a salary it took me nearly 4 years to work my way into.) This new employee is a recent college graduate with very little work experience (and no experience in this particular industry) and almost immediately pissed everyone off by trying to change our processes without taking the time to learn anything about the organization (or industry) first. He is an arrogant ladder-climber who thinks he knows best, especially when faced with women in leadership. (Much of our management team is female and/or queer.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince he began, at least five employees (myself included) have come forward to senior management (including one member of senior management!) to lodge formal complaints about his behavior, which runs the gamut from simple laziness/failure to perform his job functions to pathological lying,  sexist comments, and deliberate exclusion of certain female managers from important meetings. Unfortunately, nothing has changed following these many complaints - I've probably buried the lede and should note that he is a relative of our organization's biggest donors who put their name on our building.  \n\n\nI'd be here writing all day if I started listing all the grievances I have with this kid, though, so I'll just cut to the point. I already felt so powerless about the situation and had decided after I made my complaint that the pros of working here are not worth leaving behind just because of one asshole. But to find out that he was elevated automatically (with no supervision from senior management to verify if he was even doing his job at all) to a salary I struggled to achieve has been such a slap in the face. I was fine with what I was earning, though I did ask for a small raise in August of this year, only to be told that I'm doing an excellent job but we \"didn't have the money.\" Come to find out, this kid receives what amounts to a $20K raise  shortly after I was told this. I just feel so dejected and disrespected. I've put so much of my time and energy into this organization, but that seems to have not counted for anything in the face of nepotism. (And possibly racism/sexism, since he is a white man and I am neither.)  \n\n\nSo back to my question - how can I move forward from this emotional setback? I don't think I want to get another job because I still love what I'm doing here and have so much freedom to learn and keep expanding my skillset. I haven't talked directly to my bosses about this situation yet because I'm not quite sure what would be appropriate to say. I had planned to ask for another performance review/raise in January because we're supposed to receive a large grant at that time and hopefully there will be no more \"we don't have the money\" excuses. But I wanted to collect my thoughts and be careful about how I approach them.  \n\n\nThank you so much for reading and any advice you might be able to provide. If nothing else, this was cathartic to write. :)",

    "text": "Becoming an electrical lineman - am I crazy? I'd like to hear advice/stories/information people have on my situation. Apologies in advance for the length, but I feel context is important when asking for guidance.\n\n*TL;DR, I'm tired of getting burned in my line of (white collar) work, considering becoming an electrical lineman - but unclear how realistic this is. Looking for advice.*\n\nI am a white collar worker who's been employed at a variety of small businesses in \"tech adjacent\" industries like creative services (graphic design, web dev, etc.), marketing, consulting, and so on.\n\nI'm well educated (masters degree), with over a decade of experience in my position (project/operations management). I have excellent references from every position I've worked in, I have good relationships with all my employers.\n\nAfter getting laid off earlier this year, I found a new job a couple of months ago, only to be informed that once again I'm getting laid off about 3 months into my new job. My boss said it's simply due to a revenue shortfall, and since I am one of the newer people, I'll be one of the people let go.\n\nThis will now mean that I've been laid off (i.e. not fired/let go for cause) 4 times within the last 9 years.\n\nEvery boss I have tells me I'm smart, talented, and capable, and I know this to be true. I'm not bragging, but I know I am good at what I do.\n\nBut it doesn't matter. I cannot get ahead. I've made decent money, I've done pretty well, but my career just constantly gets derailed.\n\nI've tried moving into different fields that are more stable (government, healthcare, etc.), but I don't ever get responses; my experience is obviously not as strong, and I have no network in those fields.\n\nI refuse to live the rest of my life on this treadmill. I don't expect miracles, I just want a decent job I can stay at for 10-20 years, so I can have some stability in my life. I don't need to be rich, just comfortable.\n\nI have come to determine that I will never find the stability I want in any sort of white collar job I am likely to get.\n\nSo I've looked into various trades. The one that seems most feasible is to become an electrical lineman. It is a trade, but you're likely to work for a large utility company, which offers fairly stable employment. The money is pretty good once you've completed your apprenticeship. While any trade is somewhat physically demanding, this seems to be comparatively mild in terms of wear and tear on your body. I'm in my late 30's, and while I'm not in great shape (office lifestyle), I'm in good health, not overweight, etc.; nothing a couple months of regular exercise couldn't fix.\n\nAnd while it becomes tricky as I get older, I feel that once I have the underlying technical knowledge after a decade of field work, I could become a project manager, as I have plenty of experience doing that.\n\nIt's a job that won't be automated or outsourced. Electricity isn't going away anytime soon, lol. The job is unionized, for state-licensed utility companies.\n\nI know it involves some regional travel, and I'm well aware that I may be out in storms, or working in semi-dangerous conditions, but I'm at peace with that.\n\nI have plenty of savings, and my wife is still employed, so I can manage with a low salary while I'm an apprentice for a couple of years.\n\nI would be working in Oregon.\n\nSo, that's my story. My wife thinks I'm crazy. But after this last layoff, something just clicked. I just can't bring myself to muster the energy to compete in a cutthroat industry that's constantly cycling through employees.

Just was going through resumes on my Handshake profile for Uni where I was applying for jobs and saw a couple old resumes I had from back in 2020 and 2021 and I cant believe I sat there and listed experience about food industry and labor jobs I had worked during community College...No wonder I wasnt getting an interview at the time or even a part-time job in something white collar. I was doing freakin odd jobs, ODD JOBS that has no spot on a resume thats meant to be tailored for a profession in a white collar line of work. \n\nI can just imagine software and Management company employers i was handing my resume off to crumpling it up and throwing it in the dustbin after I lfet. Like What was i thinking?? I was just naive i guess because I was trying to be honest but sadly honesty doesnt get you far in this cold dark world.\n\nAnyways, from what I learned now is that either what gets you the job is to be fair and sqaure sugarcoating your role/responsibilities, position or even company you worked at. Lets be honest not to  be honest. I quickly deleted those old useless resumes from my system because even though I had experience working as as an assistant manager for said Thai fine dining restaraunt, some employers may have seen that as a waste of time when i could have been doing better with my life..smh. \n\nAnyways, kind of wanted to make this rant-like because sadly, Ive seen the failures this kind of resume brings people and it sucks that people cannot be honest about their experience anymore",

    "text": "How to move to a white collar job at 34 when all you have is fast food experience and a stale degree? I have an engineering degree from 12 years ago but haven't done anything with it. Wasn't able to find a job in the field. Tried to do grad school but dropped out and have 70k+ in student loans. All I have is 6 years in fast food, 5 of them as a shift lead. I want something better for myself. The next position above me is General Manager but I don't want to get stuck in the food industry forever and I want to have free time to pursue jobs in other industries.\n\nIdeally, I want to be an engineer. Is it too late for that? Getting another degree seems prohibitively expensive and it doesn't look like financial aid is a viable option with all that unpaid student loans. I've considered trades. But I really want to break into a white collar job and not have to do manual labor my whole life.\n\nI've also considered working in a bank as a teller and trying to advance from there into the finance world. Or getting into accounting. I'm naturally good at math.\n\nAre there jobs that I can get that require just \"any\" bachelors degree as opposed to a specific one? Because I can't imagine getting hired as an engineer with a 12 year old degree and no relevant experience. Is there something I can do, certifications I can get, or work experience that will allow me to leverage that degree.\n\nI also have a clean background so surely that should give me some advantage in jobs where background checks are a barrier to entry. My biggest issue has been not being able to quickly get a job upon graduation, finding a fast food job, getting too comfortable, and in the blink of an eye, 7 years have passed.\n\nI'm single, can work anytime and my schedule at my current job is flexible so can work two jobs at once. I currently work roughly 38-40 hours a week.",

    "text": "I quit after two months, did I make a mistake? This is a long one!\n\nI recently started, and promptly quit, a job at a group psychotherapy practice as a recent graduate. This place has pretty bad Glassdoor reviews. I accepted the job offer because my position (in the context of a larger group/cohort I was part of) was created as a means to address and fix this place's reputation. I was promised access to stellar mentorship, training, and supervision. \n\nThe orientation was filled with a lot of stuff like: \"share something with the entire group that you've never told anyone before\", talk about how this group is a family, and we're here to challenge what it means to be professional. Lot of discussion on how professionalism is steeped in white supremacy/patriarchy. However, I found that the more candid I became the more it irked my manager. I am susceptible to and have been in cults before. In hindsight I realize I was very triggered and became overly vulnerable as a way to try to protect myself but it had the opposite effect.\n\nI started getting weird vibes because my manager would sometimes snap at some of us (mostly me) for asking too many questions and then would go back to being really nice. It was an odd back and forth that I didn't understand so I pulled her aside one day to ask her what was up and if she was upset with me. \n\nShe told me I take up too much space in the group and I need to be mindful of that, and do more to soothe myself before I just launch into an emotional external process. I took it in, said that makes sense, and remediated my behavior. Well, as the orientation ended they front loaded me with high acuity clients and did not provide me with a supervisor. Some people in-house, including a person who holds a high office, offered to supervise me in the interim, but they ended up ghosting me a few times. The times I did see them, supervision ended with me in tears feeling torn down as a clinician. So my manager offered to be my temporary supervisor while she \"found\" someone else for me.\n\nNow I had new emotional baggage to work through. I frequently processed in the larger group about how much not having a set supervisor/consistent training impacted me. I said I feel like I'm not cut out for this job. I talked a lot about how lost I felt seeing high intensity clients with no sense of direction. I was again told I can't talk about my feelings like that in the group to the extent I was. But my feelings and confusion started to become unbearable,\n\nNot too long after this, they gave an office I reserved a month prior to see a client, to someone else. I was left to scramble to find a room (I was going to have to cancel my session with this client). Finally, someone put me in a storage room in the back after I was running around panicking on the verge of tears for 10 minutes. I raised concern about this to my temporary supervisor/manager, who told me that because I'm such an emotional person I must have done something to evoke an unhelpful response in people. She told me again that I need to be aware of how I do a lot to make other people responsible for my feelings. \n\nI ended up quitting not too long after this because I got pulled in again and was going to get put on a PIP because I started seeking additional/outside consultation on my situation and it upset them that I wasn't communicating with them directly about my feelings. I was like, \"this is obviously just not a good culture fit lets just call it here\".\n\nNow I'm left feeling confused and overwhelmed because I'm not sure if it was me, them, or just a bad fit. I've never quit a job after two months. I have so many fears and uncertainties in my mind right now. What if I can't get another job? Did I make a mistake?",

    "text": "Engineer with PhD in Germany - How to decide my next career step? Hi, writing this from a temp account for obvious reasons.\n\nI'm  in my mid-30ies in Germany and studied micro engineering up to a PhD because university was a nice environment and the salary was decent. At university, I worked in experimental laboratories on various topics.\n\nAfter  finishing at university, I looked for any interesting engineering job  and landed one with a contractor agency as a mechanical engineer - I was in a team with a 2-ton prototype device and we ran tests on it, improved the software, that kind of thing. However, it wasn't really  academically challenging and I was bored from work and people.\n\nAfter  2 years I switched to a non-profit/publicly funded tech consulting  agency to write white papers on current tech issues. That is a lot more  interesting content-wise and people-wise, but it's desk work only, which  I also find boring, and also bad for my health.\n\nSo  now I want to switch into something where I do actual stuff with my hands and eyes, and maybe work on actual problems, probably related to environmental issues. However, I'm not sure how I can use my degree and all my past experience (PhD, Experimental Engineer, Desk Work with important  people) to find a suitable job profile.\n\nIf I look for research engineering positions again, I compete with graduates\n\nIf I look for middle management stuff I continue to sit on a desk in zoom calls and further destroy my health.\n\nI  feel like I combine a lot of valuable skills and should not just go for  any random job. Still I don't know which job profile might fit. Any  advice how I could move from here? Thanks!",

    "text": "I feel like all of my current and former peers are passing me by at 100mph and I’m stuck spinning my tires in situations I hate with no way of changing them. How do I turn it around? \nTl;dr I need to escape a dead end job and subpar educational background and actually become something but I feel like even though I have the drive to change it, I don’t know where to start, don’t know if I have the resources to do so at all. \n\nKind of a rant. Idk. \n\nI graduated from college a year and two months ago with a degree in history and English. Since then I have held two jobs: I managed a coffee shop, which was fun but unsustainable, and I worked at a hotel which is my current job. Well paying, but not enjoyable tbh. \n\nMy grades weren’t amazing when I graduated because I had been struggling with pretty substantial major depression and suicidal ideation for the second half of college that happened during Covid. Still, “c’s get degrees” and all that so I powered through. History and English are really my main two interests aside from more niche subtopics like anthropology, studies of myth & religion, archaeology, etc. but I just knew that I didn’t want to do something that wouldn’t play to a passion of mine. I want to love my work even if it means sacrificing financial stability now. \n\nI now have neither. \n\nI regret my degrees and wish, as someone who didn’t aim for the focus of being a teacher or some shit that I had specialized my focus to anthropology or archaeology more closely but I’m insanely broke and can’t even fathom going back to school to pick up the pieces and get another degree, even fast-tracked or online (I also just don’t think it would look good). I also told myself I wasn’t interested in grad school in the past and that I would worry about it in the future if I wanted but I needed a break. That was a mistake. The opportunity for some sort of internship came and went forever. I never corresponded closely enough with professors to get a leg up in that regard. And again, I got so-so grades for useless degrees and I have not been proven to have had any more worth than someone who just straight up didn’t go to college. I wasted four years for a lifetime of shame and regret and crippling debt. My current partner also says that I can’t go to grad school unless I can get funding because it would leave us too deep in debt so it’s seemingly off the table, but tot doesn’t even look like people in my field are making decent splashes with their careers anyways unless they have doctorates which like, as if. \n\nMeanwhile, my two close friends got degrees in business and communications and are working comfortable high-paying jobs. They’re both 23 and just bought their first house. My older sister just moved to Chicago for grad school after an absolutely incredible i story of internships, opportunities, and points of excellence as a student and my younger sister had an internship with a law firm as an undergrad with law school aspirations. Even my friend who dropped out of college and is a full-blown alcoholic is working an extremely successful career as a mechanic. And I’m here, working in hospitality for barely enough money to scrape by with a partner who isn’t doing much better in a role that I probably only needed a GED to get in a city I didn’t really want to live in. I feel like a failure. \n\nEveryone says I’m smart. Everyone has said I’m smart my whole life. I don’t feel smart. I feel inept at everything I do. I struggled through high school. I struggled in college. I like the things that I mentioned. I live for books and literature and sagas of history and the world of man, and want to spend a lifetime studying humanity and sharing my findings with humanity. I wanted to be a professor but I can wave that goodbye without good grades, grad school, or any real achievements to stand on. I’m even writing a book, as author is another big achievement that I would love to reach, but I’m 30,000 words/100 pages deep into writing it and just feel defeated. I doubt myself at every turn and I feel like finishing a story that people will care about as much as I do and actually conquering the task of traditional publication is such a Herculean task that it feels impossible. I write regardless, but it doesn’t hold the same luster. I can’t even get a job working the door of a museum with how bad the job market is rn, and neither can people I know that DO have master’s degrees. \n\nI even decided at one point that I would be content with working in a coffee shop my whole life. Why not? It was fun. I was good at it. I made people happy and worked in an environment that didn’t make me wish I was dead. Making flat whites doesn’t keep food on the table though. I even got a job offer from a coffee shop that I would consider dream job territory and when I asked if their wage of $11/hr was negotiable as I couldn’t survive off of that, they cut contact with me. \n\nI moved to a different city because I thought that that would change things. Cities are where opportunities are, right? It’s no different. \n\nI’m 22 years old. 23 in a month. I feel like every action I’ve taken in my life thus far has been failure after failure leading me to the failure that I am now, and I’m just stuck job hopping in industries that I hate forever until I get my big break too late for me to be able to smother out the regret of lost opportunities with money or I die.\n\nI don’t sleep anymore. I eat enough to stay mostly alive. I stopped going to the gym, which was my one great non-intellectual hobby that brought me joy. I just want to succeed. I just want to be given the chance that will let me live a life that makes me happy in the moment and satisfied with my work and what I achieved when I get to the end. What am I working towards? What the fuck do I even want to achieve? \n\nI need to know that I’m not the only one here…more importantly I need to know that others have been here and broken free. I need to know that someone can make all of this worth it and BE something. To achieve or contribute to something. To be great in small ways that can, if no one else, make me proud. Make me feel less small. Make me feel like I’m not the floundering black sheep of a family that has always been able to just “make it work” so fucking effortlessly. \n\nI’m sorry for being so melodramatic. I just wish it would all stop sometimes.",

I worked in no-profit healthcare for most of my 20s, starting when I first began college and found an entry-level job at a hospital. I graduated with a bachelor's and then master's degree in behavioral and community sciences, and worked my way up through patient advocacy positions in acute care until I became a supervisor. I enjoyed my work at its core, but it was a high stress, low pay position.\n\nThe allure of better benefits drew me to apply to an entry level position at the local branch of a giant insurance corporation, but instead they recruited me into their executive development program. I underwent vigorous training and worked my way through various roles until entering management, and I've been managing teams of direct reports in customer-facing positions for 4 years now.\n\nHistorically I've always been an extroverted person with a love for public speaking and working in a team environment. The pandemic hit me hard, and while I grew to appreciate WFH, it absolutely impacted the way I work, and think about my work. Then last year I experienced a personal tragedy, took three days off and kept chugging along, because I've always prided myself on being a 'workhorse'. This event made me realize that years of handling everyone else's crises was weighing on me, and I needed a career change for my own wellbeing.\n\nIn contrast to how I felt pre-2020, in the past few years the times I've felt happiest and most fulfilled at work have been when I've been handed a major internal issue and tasked with independently analyzing data to find trends and develop solutions. I've found that I LOVE being able to actually see my productivity at the end of a day, since it's coming from hard data and not just coaching and delegating and de-escalating customers. \n\nMy current position has only limited opportunities for this kind of data analysis/quality control/process improvement, so I'm looking to branch out, but I know that my soft skills won't be nearly enough in this field. I've been looking at coursera programs for data analytics and project management, and the Lean Six Sigma certification (I'd been through the white belt introductory seminar at work and LOVED it) but I'm pushing 40 and approaching the idea of an abrupt career change much more hesitantly than I did at 30.\n\nIs this kind of career switch viable?

The main problem I have faced so far as a professional is that I miss a lot of deadlines.  \n\n\nFor the first 6-7 months, my features kept breaking in the staging environment, and QAs also reported many simple bugs. Ultimately, I used to end up missing deadlines and often working late nights, even on weekends. Soon i realised that I should test the feature/bug fix well and think for different scenarios before getting my PR merged. I noticed that there was a slight improvement in my performance.  \n\n\nBut to enhance my performance further, I followed few strategies for better time management, like blocking time for tasks, using priority-based lists, white-boarding the solution before implementing it. And although it has made me feel that I am in control of my time, it didn't really make a significant impact.  \n\n\nOften, I keep working on my office work in my free time, due to which I don't get much time for my personal projects. Even after this, there's a spillover in my sprint almost everytime. Is it normal for freshers to work longer hours because they lack technical knowledge?   \n\n\nI wanted some advice from the folks here who have gone through this phase and have done good job in their careers.",

    "text": "Why the Gen Z \"problem\" isn't going away I don't think a day has gone by when I don't see a member of this community complain about our newest generation in the workforce. They start threads unironically wondering, \"why isn't my staff (that i've never took the time to meet) caring about the spreadsheets that I took 5 minutes over a Teams meeting explaining\" or \"my staff is leaving at 5:30 pm during busy season! Help!\".\n\nIt has occurred to me that none of the older generations have an iota of understanding of how we got here, even the \"with it\" millennials.\n\nLet's start from the beginning:\n\n**Boomers**: Started the bullshit. They saw their parents go through WWII and any perceived laborious white collar work was deemed \"at least better than war\". Thus the shit snowball was born.\n\n**Gen X**: Got fucked, but didn't complain much because they got to pay for their first house in dimes they found on the way to work every day.\n\n**Millennials**: Got fucked doubly with the great recession and still bad conditions but also didn't complain. But also are understanding of Gen Z for a variety of reasons.\n\n**Gen Z**: Graduated during COVID isolated from their peers largely. Looks at the cost of everything that the older generations took for granted (and internally screams): Housing, child rearing, food. Inflation abounds, sees wages on their horizon that have stagnated for 20 years. Feels like they missed out on crucial college years and a part of their 20's due to COVID. Suffers the most mental health issues due to all the previous issues along with being saddled with more student loan debt than one should ever have.\n\nThey spent their college years looking at other majors that either involved less work and more fun, or more payoff later. Aha, they thought! They chose the \"practical\" major, you see. The payoff will be later.\n\nAfter being lubed up from an internship that felt more like a fun paid summer vacation, they were on top of the world.\n\nThen full-time starts. They start work remotely, mindlessly rolling forward workpapers without being told why or how, by a manager who is too busy with their own kids at home to field questions from someone who doesn't know anything yet. They don't meet anyone, after all no one is at the office and reaching out to people they don't know is already intimidating enough.\n\nEven then with all the shitstorm they have to deal with economically, they thought, \"Well, this isn't too bad. At least my evenings are free.\"\n\nThen PA rears its ugly head for the first time with their first busy season, and the distinction between day and night become blurred as they figure out it really doesn't matter in PA. As the 14 hour workdays become a reality, they know they made a mistake.\n\nThey start checking out, \"quiet quitting\", performing the bare minimum or poorly.\n\nBecause of their perceived work ethic, and because they have newer, shiny toys and electronics and our GDP is higher than it was in 1960, the accusations of laziness pour in. But it doesn't do any damage to them, because they are wiser than anyone gives them credit for.\n\nThey know that the only thing they have control over anymore is their time.\n\nThey can't control the fact that they may never be able to own a home that they want, climate change, AI bullshit, Russian war machine.\n\nTime is their last line of defense, and they'd rather spend it going to a concert than filing a return that you should've told me about a week ago rather than 10 minutes before I was supposed to fucking leave, Denise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

    "text": "7 YEARS LATER - UPDATE: \"For those who are constantly flooded by negativity by this subreddit, just know there are plenty of people out there who enjoy working in public accounting.\" [Original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/55tbu2/for_those_who_are_constantly_flooded_by/)\n\n[Follow-up post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/ane6x5/2_years_later_update_for_those_who_are_constantly/)\n\nWell guys, it's feeling like it's time for another follow-up on my now seven-year-old attempt at providing a contrasting viewpoint to the otherwise largely negative take on life in public accounting. Yes, I and everyone else is well aware that the accounting profession extends far beyond public accounting. Yes, everyone's experience is different and unique. I'm just here giving my two-cents through the years in the profession.\n\nI don't need to parrot and repeat things I already have; my takes are largely the same. Working in public has been good to me, and I'm certainly not alone. I'm still stimulated, challenged, and enjoy the work while being able to maintain a work-life balance that works well for me as someone who has their career far from the top of their life priorities. This is moreso a follow-up to all the \"just wait until you're a senior/manager/etc.\"- well, I'm here 7 years later as a senior manager and I still feel broadly the same with perhaps some more nuanced takes. I'll open it up to commentary and questions after aimlessly ranting about some random musings of mine in no order with the disclaimer that I don't know shit about anything and don't claim any of what I'm about to say to be gospel or even remotely factual:\n\n* Care less. Setting limits for yourself in what you're willing to do/not willing to do is a pretty key skill that not everyone has right out of the gate. I've always been a path of least resistance type of person, and have no desire to ever work more than what I need to; the limits of what I'm willing to do for a white collar job are pretty low. This has forced me to only do and focus on things which I've learned are important and make a difference to those I'm being evaluated by, and I frequently see a disconnect between what someone thinks is important/necessary to do and spend time on and what actually moves the needle to those they are being evaluated by. There's no shortage of work in this profession - you'll never get ahead of things, nothing will ever be perfect, you can work every waking moment of every single day but if it isn't moving the needle for others, then all is lost.\n\n* Public accounting is in a lot of ways college 2.0. You go straight from a structured school system with defined years/levels right into a career that mirrors that structure, with peers who are by and large the same as those you were in school with. A lot of these people are competitive, and a lot [from my experience] come from white collar backgrounds with minimal struggle and are accustomed to success and pats on the back so long as they check the boxes of a syllabus and get good grades, and are used to continuous feedback in the form of a percentage/grade to always know how well they are doing. When you jump from that right into a career where you don't have a syllabus and don't get grades, people scramble to define what success is for themselves. These people aren't used to being without immediate feedback and aren't used to any sense of failure and they cling to the one thing that is measurable/tangible and well within their control: putting in hours. It creates a partially self-inflicted toxic environment that we claim to hate but tend to perpetuate ourselves. It's odd to me that those who have the least to lose and have plenty to fall back on often are the ones who take things far too seriously and burn themselves out in avoidance of failure. \n\n* People should remember that the worst that can happen to them is getting canned and having find a job somewhere else. I come from a blue-collar background and worked a stint in the labor force before going down this whole accounting route and I find people who have some experience outside of the white-collar world take things a lot less seriously and have a healthier scope of what matters and what doesn't. If you have your CPA and have any experience in public, you're in a better position than most to find something you're qualified for. In the earlier years of your career, this simply means you're now forced to find a different job that will likely make you more money than you were making. It's wild how many people completely burn themselves out and drain themselves to the point where they can't take it anymore and grind all the way up until the very last moment when they have to leave on their own when you have the option of simply drawing a line in the sand of what you're willing to do, and seeing what happens if you don't go past it. Even speaking up for yourself and listing demands of what works for you and what doesn't, and being explicit in what it is you want to do at your firm can yield someone a lot, yet this is rarely done.\n\n* To summarize - look out for #1 - yourself. Don't be taken advantage of, don't be belittled, get comfortable enough to know your worth and call your shots while developing an understanding of what moves the needle for those you're being evaluated by. We're all selfish beings. What gets people's attention are things that make their life better or worse. Striving to frame how getting what it is you want will help/be beneficial to those who are in control of your career is key.\n\nFire away and give me your worst r/accounting so we can continue this fantastic tradition.",

    "text": "The accounting profession is uniquely well suited for unionization 4 reasons:\n\n1 - Let's be real, there is little difference between a top performer and a median performer in accounting. Unionization usually ends up hurting top performers in order to lift up median performers - this is why professions like sales or engineering are so hard to unionize, as top performers can perform/add value 1,000x as much as median performers. There's no such worry in accounting - both top and median performers will benefit from collective bargaining.\n\n2 - Accountants are a necessity. Unlike digital marketing, management consulting, graphic designers, etc - no large business can run without staff accountants and accounting managers. If accountants go on strike, the business is in serious trouble.\n\n3 - We are now facing a massive challenge (offshoring jobs to India) that can really only be overcome by unionization and collective bargaining. You can't \"outperform\" your way out of offshoring unless you're very high up in the field, it's going to happen one way or the other - why the fuck would companies pay more to hire you when someone in Mumbai will do the work for 1/20th the cost? Sure, you might be more efficient than the Indian guy, but are you 20x more efficient?\n\n4 - Accountants, generally speaking, are already underpaid and overworked compared to other comparable white-collar professions. Both partners in PA and executives in industry know this very well. Which means we already have quite a lot of room to negotiate once collective bargaining begins - we won't be starting from an unreasonable position.",

    "text": "Boss hates me Not sure if i’m overthinking this but my partner is a white older man and I’m a younger, non-white, not attractive girl who doesn’t drink. Sometimes I get worried that he thinks I might not be a good face to put forward to clients. I’m clean, presentable, I’m super social, but maybe not the right look? \n\nAlmost overnight, my partner stopped talking to me. Stopped making eye contact, or would ignore conversational questions directed to him in meetings. Whilst he’s super busy and stressed, I see him talk to the other lower level staff in our team (who are more attractive than me). I’ve asked him about his day whilst our team was in a group, and he straight up pretended to not hear and talked about something else. When it comes to opportunities to be client facing or internal opportunities, he always picks the other graduate. My sample size isn’t big enough, so not sure if this is by chance or in my head.\n\nI don’t think my performance is the problem (unless I’m super not self aware) because when I’ve asked for feedback my coach and other managers give me positive feedback and we all get along. They are the ones who offer me up to opportunities as well so technically I’m not being left out and still have opportunities to interact with clients. \n\nReally the only evidence I have is that he ices me out. I’m giving in so much effort to this job, and I really want to stay, but it seems pointless if my partner isn’t happy with me.\n\nToday another team member and I stayed back late to study. He asked her how she was going and empathised with the study load. When he noticed I was there too, he made brief eye contact and wished the other girl goodnight. I felt myself want to cry and leave. This is the second time this happened, another time he was engaging with the whole team at an event except me. I’m not sensitive but the rejection made me want to cry my eyes out and quit on the spot. \n\n\nBut in all of this, he hired me. He once congratulated me for my exam marks and made the effort to welcome me when I first started. So am I going crazy? What’s happening here? \n\nWhat’s the best thing to do here, leave? Wait it out? Confront him? Is it not that big of a deal?\n\nI’ve never had this problem before, is this just a reality for people like me?",

I’ve been at three different companies FT (started in Big 4, moved to industry, and left accounting for finance) as well as two companies for internships since I graduated from college 5 years ago. \n\nI’m not sure if I’m playing the race card here, but I experienced micro aggressions from my white colleagues when I was at the Big 4 and never from anyone who wasn’t white. Not sure if it’s due to coincidence since most folks I’ve worked with have been white, but at my next job in industry, my boss was from my cultural background (as well as my boss’s boss’s boss) and during my time there, I was promoted twice in 3 years. \n\nAt the Big 4, my team was pretty cliquey and I often found myself excluded (along with two others who were also minorities but were staff like me) from lunches and inside jokes. I just couldn’t click with my team since I’m more on the introverted side. \n\nEventually I left my industry job for a high finance job, where I was the only woman on a 12-person team (which consisted of 10 white men). I wasn’t close to anyone other than another analyst, who was the only other minority. Culture was also like the big 4. \n\nIs this all just in my head that I’ve felt that many of my white colleagues have been subtly discriminatory and expected me to bend over backwards for them? I’ve found that I inevitably end up chatting with the other minorities whenever we’re at work functions. Even in my industry job where I felt accepted, I was working for the only other minority woman. \n\nTLDR; I have found myself stagnating in teams that lack diversity/support for diversity. Bending over backwards for teams with homogeneous management has been the only way for me to keep my job, and I’m exhausted. I never felt distressed/bullied when I worked at my industry job with a fellow woman from my cultural background. I’m targeting diverse teams from now on even if the pay is not a high.

He had served in many industries. The sight of  John, a Consultant, offended him, especially after he learned that John  was from PwC. It seemed to the Assurance Associate that John was in  abominable taste, and supposed that John had gone to a lot of silly  trouble to dress himself just so.  \n\nThe Assurance Associate spoke English, and he said to John, \"I take it you find Accountancy a very comical thing.\"  \n\nJohn looked at him vaguely. John had lost track momentarily of  where he was or how he had gotten there. He had no idea that people  thought he was clowning. It was his job, of course, which had dressed  him up - his job and a feeble desire to impress his clients.  \n\n\"Did you expect us to laugh?\" the Assurance Associate asked him.  The Assurance Associate was demanding some sort of satisfaction. John  was mystified. John wanted to be friendly, to help, if he could, but his  resources were meager. His fingers now held the two objects from his  briefcase. John decided to show the Assurance Associate what they were.  \n\n\"You thought we would enjoy being mocked?\" the Assurance  Associate said. \"And do you feel proud to represent PwC as you do?\" John  withdrew a hand from his briefcase, held it under the Assurance  Associate's nose. On his palm rested a stack of documents and a business  card. The business card was an unremarkable little artifact - white and  black and red. John smiled.  \n\nThe parade pranced, staggered, and reeled to the lobby of the  PwC office building, and then it went inside. The office wasn't a  bustling place any more. Almost all the accounting and consulting work  in the world had been done and reviewed and audited by professionals,  mostly from Deloitte.

Behind it was a  restroom, which was a private space with stalls.  \n\nThere was a big number over the door of the floor. The number  was five. Before the consultants could go inside, their project manager  told them to memorize their simple floor number, in case they got lost  in the big office.

Just like many of you I learn by doing not book learning. Being ADHD and Dyslexic I see the world a little different than others. As a Solution Architect and Security information and Event Management lead it was a natural role for me as it utilized how I see Data as it ingresses, egress and moves lateral in a modern Ecosystem and how to implement it into some of the largest Data Networks in the world which was amazing and truly fulfilling. Like I told them when they hired me “My oath did not have a expiration date, even though I retired I still want to serve!” And they let me do that.\n\nBeing a data guy and a Vet I am a copious Note taker and wanted to share some rules I learned over the last 3 years.\n\n**Character is important:** We live in a world where every word is recorded, misinterpreted and lawyers go over every legal agreement and statement of work to make sure both parties are protected. To me I took a simpler approach “I give you my word that my team and I will help you” and so I did. I did not care about the white noise of the world but focused on keeping my word as that was their expectation of our services. At a certain point all the consultanting companies are the same so the clients just wanted to have confidence that we will do what we say and keep our word. Honor and Integrity are not concepts to be pulled out when they need something to be negotiated but are core to who we are as people and the company we represent. Do what you say and say what you do. Keep it simple. \n\n**Listen First, Talk Last:** The people I met were some of the best in the world. Day in and day out they are in the thick of the storm fighting the good fight. When they want to employ a consultant usually they have already figured out the solution but just needs us to validate or execute it as they are still in the storm fighting. I always told my folks “we are like the Coast Guard and they are the leaky boat in the hurricane. We fly in and help them patch their boats, give them a new motor, help them with their navigation to realign them to a true North Framework then we head to the beach for Mai Tais and volleyball until called again but they stay in the storm hopefully with a better boat then when we arrived.” They are always in the storm so listening first and understanding their challenges will help us integrate and help them with their challenges as we bring industry insight to them to hopefully stop them from bailing water all the time.\n\n**Lead, Don’t Manage:** This is ingrained in every NCO (Noncommissioned Officer) from day one. We are only as good as the people we work with. In a world where loyalty is based on the Fiscal year and the greener, shiner object across the street by leading your people and truly showing them that you are there for them they will work for you and stay with you and not be tempted by the grass is greener on the other side of the street. I am truly proud that I had one of the lowest attrition rates and a huge success rate while I was at EY but very little was me but my team pulling together as a team. Forgetting the normal politics and focusing on being part of the solution. Harry Truman once said “You can get a lot of things done if you don’t try to take credit.” They emphasized this on a grand scheme, and they all knew I was available 24/7 if they needed me and if need be I would jump in front of the bus for them over and over again as that is what a leader does. Managers just look at the team as assets and resources to be discarded when done. A leader Drives the team to become a team and think beyond themselves and protects each and everyone of them so they can accomplish their goals and live their passion in their chosen profession.\n\n**It takes a Village, Not a villager:** One of the earliest and most heartfelt lessons I ever learned was EGO is the destroyer. I can truthfully say there was not one day I did not learn something from my team and the people I came into contact with. When I look at a global Ecosystem / network it is a like a symphony to me. I can hear if the drums are to loud or the horns are out of tune or if there is a rogue soloist trying to make a name for themselves. They all come together in my brain but the crux is there is order in the chaos and you cannot have a symphony / great work of music if everyone is not doing what they are supposed to be doing. Very quickly as people align to the same page the music comes from being discordant to a thing of beauty and amazement. No single person can do it alone. The maestro is nothing without the orchestra. Everyday you can learn something new and everyone has a place in the digital symphony we call a data network.\n\n**Remove Fear:** Frank Herbert really nailed how to deal with Fear in dune; it is the “mind-killer” and in a modern organization it can be disastrous to the enterprise. Fear has no place when data is the truth. In the military we used to say “We trust but we validate” When lives are on the line we don’t guess and we don’t make decisions in fear as it will cost lives. In the modern world remove fear and focus on character and data. Data is truth and character will guide you. There can neve be a situation where you fear for your job or not telling the client or boss “Truth”. The world around us deals in “fake News” we don’t. We focus on the data and we “KNOW” before we elevate or recommend. We never shirk from our roles as the data gods as truth is our watch word and the foundation of who we are. Fear is the mind-killer and in a job where we are paid to think, fear is nothing more than an anchor that will weigh you down and prevent you from being the best you are able, when ever you are able. \n\n**The right Skillset to the right role to the right outcome**: The world of a modern Ecosystem is a diverse as the stars in the sky and everyone has a different skillset supporting their roles to drive revenue for the business. We should always strive to understand the skills to accomplish a task and never try to shove a person into a role that that they don’t have the skills to accomplish the outcome or the role assigned. In SOCOM we are surgical when we build a team and understand every skillset and the strengths that guide those skillsets to the mission outcome. Everyone has a role to play and every skillset feeds that to the ultimate outcome. In the modern ecosystem we should learn these skillsets and roles to support. \n\n**Be Honest and Authentic at all times:** So many times people told me I was known for being “authentic and honest” and I enjoyed that but it ultimately led me down the thought pattern “well what are others doing.” So many people put on a face for a client or change who they are for the company they support. Stop it! The clients don’t want that and you don’t want that. What is the point of reaching the end of the race if you lost yourself in the race. Be you. You are knowledgeable and know right from wrong just speak your truth and it will work out. Usually people will respect you more for it than just being another person on a call. I remember one time I got feedback from a client “I don’t remember everyone else on the call, but I remember the guy with the hat and the swords, He really got it and understood our challenges.” (for those who don’t know I have a collection of swords on my office wall and I always wear a ballcap, it is me.) Never be afraid to be yourself (unless you are narcissistic Asshat than maybe you should get into another line of work and a different viewpoint of the world.)\n\nI have other lessons but these were the ones on top of my mind. A very long time ago a great friend of mine (was my XO at the time and now 30+ years later still my friend) gave me a book “About Face, The Odssey of an American Warrior” written by Col David Hackworth. I was a young man when I read it and one of the biggest lessons I learned from that book was he used to carry a green book and in it he would write things are good that he saw in leadership and things that were bad. I did that for 20 years of military service and I continue today in the private sector. These are my lessons that I learned and are not meant for any individual or company but life lessons that I reflected on as I continue my Journey outside of consulting (went Vendor specific). They are not meant to change anyone’s mind or call anyone out (legal disclaimer in the world we live in) but merely sharing my wisdom on my journey. Remember it takes a village and my village is the world as we all have a part to play in it and we are better together, being alone only finds you wandering in the dark screaming for help. (alone does not mean not being a individual for those who choose to pick apart my words.",

    "text": "Deliver with partial assumption vs deliver with detailed requirement from customer Hi consultants of Reddit, I have a work dilemma which I would like to pick y'all expert minds here.\n\nI am on a case to help client develop a new sales report for their management, requestor is a mid-senior manager, new to the system the company uses. Upon analyzing the format given, some data and column name were confusing to understand what data is required here, the manager wasn't sure where those information should source from and need to confirm with the end user almost all the time. Despite the clear objective of this report is simple, to review gross profit by service item, this process of \"let me check with my end user\" has dragged this request for more than a month and it is still going, which is not looking good for my company and client's management is not happy for the slow service.\n\nSo here's my dilemma, I have gathered what I can to piece the report formula together but I'm not sure if that is 100% what the client wants. Do I deliver the report based on what I understand the client wants(since they take too long to come back with a firm answer) OR do I continue to follow up and make sure client agrees with the requirements, only then I proceed to get technical to develop it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first is quicker, but leaves room for wrong deliverables. Wrong requirement = time wasted to develop = unable to bill customer and still need to fix it. The latter is slower, but makes sure both parties align, billable time, if client claims the report is not as per what they want(which happens quite often with this account), there's always black and white to fall back on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe PM in the house is against the latter as we come off as incapable to understand what client wants and unable to offer sound advice, but the technical department is against the latter because we're wasting resources if we can't bill the deliverables and need to make changes again. Sadly, the work culture in my country, making error is frowned upon in comparison to western culture that may be more open to admit that they don't know everything.\n\nHappy to hear some opinion here.",

    "text": "Systemic Racism is Real. My unfortunately racist and homophobic hotel experience in Montreal. Hi Everyone!\n\n\nI really need some advice as I still feel pretty shaken up. \n\n\nTo give you guys some background:\n\n\nMy brother and I were doing a small college road trip and decided to stay in Montreal on our way home. My brother and I are both black americans with dreadlocks. I identify as queer and I had specially designed rainbow nails 🌈\n\n\nOnce we arrived in Montreal we used a third party provider to book our stay. We check in and everything seems fine. Valet is amazing and they even gave us a free upgrade! Our experience was going well until we decided to extend our stay. That's when things took a turn for the worst.\n\n\nThe manager, a middle-aged white woman who spoke at least three languages, seemed nice enough. I hadn't thought much about her when I saw her at the front desk. We let her know that we wanted to extend our stay and she said of course. It wasn't until she looked down at her screen that her entire demeanor changed.\n\n\n She mentioned that we were given a free upgrade and looked appalled. She said that we would have to pay for the upgrade moving forward and we were fine with that. She typed something into the system and said we needed to scan our credit card again so that they could put another 250-dollar hold on our account for incidentals. Okay, inconvenient but understandable.\n\n\nAfter we scanned our card I couldn't tell if she needed anything else because she went silent and stopped interacting with us. I asked if she needed anything else from us and she dismissively shrugged her shoulders, put her hands up, and said \"I don't know.\" We thanked her and she responded with an insincere thank you.\n\n\nTo make a long story shorter our hotel stay concluded with this hotel manager directing the front desk staff, bellhop, and valet to withhold our belongings and vehicle until we gave them our credit card for a third time at checkout. Even though they had already placed multiple holds on our card totaling 500 dollars and it was still reflected on our online banking statement. \n\n\n By the end of our stay both my brother and I felt afraid and unwelcomed. I think the manager specifically directed her staff to make our stay unpleasant. We felt bullied by the hotel staff.\n\n\nAfter we checked out, one of the managers (who was a white man) asked me about my stay. Usually I'm too afraid to speak up but I was honest and told him that my experience was rude and racist outside of the stellar treatment I received from valet. He told me that my experience wasn't the only one and that this has happened to multiple other guests. He said that he personally has spoken with upper management about it but they refuse to do anything.\n\n\nI don't want this to happen to other families but this problem appears to be systemic and I don't know if there is any way that I can bring about real change. I need your advice ladies 🙏🏿❤️ What should I do?\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: Thank you all so much for your support ❤️❤️ I definitely will see who I can contact in corporate. I was afraid to say the name but I hate feeling like I have to keep others comfortable even when they have no regard for my own comfort. \n\nUpdate #2: You all are so amazing 😭 Thank you for validating my feelings. I'm sorry I haven't responded to everyone yet. Since you all have been so amazing I want to be vulnerable with you guys. My mental health has been suffering a bit after this. I've just been on edge and anxious. I keep going between anger and feeling helpless. I'm going to talk to my therapist. But I was embarrassed that I wasn't over everything the next day. Just taking some time for me ❤️❤️❤️ You all are truly so supportive! Thank you so much 🫂\n\n\n\nThe hotel is the InterContinental Montreal, an IHG Hotel ✨\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a list of some of the microaggressions I experienced during my stay: (unfortunately, my instincts were right. I already had a strong sense of unease after the first microaggression and it meant that something worse was ahead)\n\n\n\n- While waiting at the hotel restaurant to order a soda my brother was told \"You know this isn't free right?\" we were then told that we couldn't charge it to our room because they didn't know if our card would work.\n\n\n- Security started banging on our door at 10:58 pm Sunday night to let us know that we needed to turn our TV down.  We were watching cartoon network at level 27 out of at least 60-something volume levels. I'm not even sure if their we're other guests staying in the rooms next to us and a curfew wasn't mentioned or posted anywhere visible.\n\n\n- I couldn't sleep the night that they sent security up to our room and I started reading more of their online reviews. Unsurprisingly, the hotel has a history of racist and homophobic profiling as well as assaulting hotel guests of color.\n\n\n- Someone was sent to knock on our door at 11:57 am to let us know that we needed to check out and had 5 more minutes. The posted check-out time was 12 noon.\n\n\n- A member of housekeeping admitted to going through our personal items and throwing away a bag with my brother's art supplies and antique coins because they thought it was trash. We went to them directly because we didn't want to put her job at risk. She kept nervously laughing and made it seem like we were inconveniencing her before she brought it up to the front desk.\n\n\n- A hotel member at the front desk said that they would comp our breakfast and 1 day's parking for throwing away our belongings but they still sent someone to knock on our door about payment. They also called us afterwards because they thought the manager only directed them to cover two breakfast items and not our full breakfast.\n\n\n- When we ordered dinner they also sent someone to knock on the door afterwards and called us to collect payment. We asked them to charge it to the room when we ordered. \n\n\n \n\n\nTLDR: I experienced prejudice on nearly every level of service interaction I had at one of the largest globally recognized hotel chains in the world. I believe I was targeted as a queer black woman with dreadlocks. (I literally had specially done rainbow nails too). I believe the woman responsible for this treatment is the manager of the hotel and I found out that this hotel has a history of profiling and assaulting guests of color. I don't want this to happen to anyone else and I'm not sure how to proceed. This problem appears to be systemic, so is there any way for me to make a difference?",

    "text": "Health PSA for my ladies I recently talked to my aunt about my baby cousin (gen Z) who has been having health issues for a while. She and my aunt have both been overweight all their lives and have a tough time managing their weight. I have medical background so they come to me sometimes with concerns. \n\nMy aunt told me that when my cousin was in high school, she was worried for her because she would bleed for almost two weeks. Her cycle would come about every three weeks but would last so long it almost seemed like she only had about a week between each cycle. \n\nThey took her to the hospital and the (white male) doctor told her that is was “normal for African women” to bleed longer and that her weight was probably the cause. He offered no tests or follow ups and she felt he basically dismissed it as “black women are fat, that makes them bleed more.” Thankfully they never went back to him, but she also never went in for a second opinion. \n\nWhen I found out I called my cousin and asked her about this. She told me that some of her friends experience the same thing and it’s so painful that most days she’s in bed and had to drop a college course because she was missing too many days.\n\nThis is NOT normal. No matter your body type. This is akin to hemorrhaging.\n\nI urged her to go see a gyno asap. Thankfully they did as soon as they could and they found MULTIPLE CYSTS on her fallopian tubes that have grown past average size and was close to rupturing. They also found scaring inside her uterus that is being investigated. \n\nThe doctor said that if she had let it go for a couple more years, she would have had to have a hysterectomy…she’s only 23. If the doctor would have caught it while she was young, she would have been able to possibly have them removed and she wouldn’t be experiencing so much bleeding and pain.\n\nIf a doctors “advice” doesn’t sit well with you, ALWAYS seek a second opinion. Don’t just brush it off. Please ♥️",

I 100% sympathize with those of you tired of reading ‘woe is me black woman’ content — if this is you please don’t read this one ❤️ \n\nBut my GOD. I live in a very white and very Asian region. I am treated like absolute shit day to day. I really can’t even say anything about the racism I experience because right now Asian people have the ear of white people as long as they’re hating on black people and white people here? Well they don’t want me here at all in the first place. So I just get double the whoop ass everyday, at work, at the grocery store, at the gym, everywhere. \n\nI’ve had one too many experiences that leave me with the feeling that people are just plain UNCOMFORTABLE with my presence. And it’s not just white people. I’ve had south Asian immigrants (not assuming, in this case there was verification as they did not yet speak English) literally look terrified that I was going to hurt or steal from them because I was walking behind them (they were in my way). \n\nThen being completely ignored or dismissed by staff at restaurants, stores, the hospital, you name it. While they address the white or Asian person in front of or behind me.\n\nAnd today, I just fucking lost it. I was at the store standing in line with a full buggy and an Asian man looked me in the eyes while he sprinted just to stand in front of me with two items. I stared, because it was just ridiculous. He says “oh I didn’t mean to cut you” and just turns around. I respond “oh it’s alright” and he literally just doesn’t acknowledge me further. Had I been angry, this would’ve beeen another instance of “discrimination”. \n\nThen a black attendant sees what happens and offers to take me in his line (express line) and I say okay. I take my big ass buggy (with a scared looking Asian couple in front of me) and then the white manager comes roaring in screaming “no you can’t be here it’s the express lane!!” \n\nThe whole store turns around and stares at me as she keeps yelling and I’m struggling with my buggy, including the guy who cut me, as if I’m causing a commotion. The same terrified looks I’ve become used to, even though I’m small and scared myself when I’m alone. It’s like a spotlight is on me at all times and I have no advocate.\n\nI lose my place in line and the stares continue as I move back. It may seem small but this is just one story in a million where I’m treating like Quasimodo in a big blue state for being unambiguously black. \n\nI’m sick of it. I’m tired. I’m tired of being told I have to be strong. Who do I owe strength to? \n\nEnd rant. I am over today.",

    "text": "It really irritates me that everyone thinks my white male coworker works harder than I do. I am an RN. I have my masters in nursing, and I have a certification in my specialty. I work with a white guy, he is an LPN.\n\nWe share a caseload of patients, and we each visit the patients weekly. My role is more managing the patients needs, communicating with family/pharmacies/doctors and NPs. I manage new admissions to our program, and discharges. I oversee the plan of care, educate caregivers and families, and communicate changes of condition. I do all of the documentation that supports compliance, and that identifies whether patients are eligible for our program on an ongoing basis. \n\nMy coworker checks vitals, texts families updates (I often tell him how to word things if there's a concern), and he executes tasks like wound care, orders med refills. He also checks in with people who don't qualify for our program (basically asks how they're doing for 5 minutes a month), but then if I ever admit them to our program they think it's because of all his \"help\".\n\nOur tasks are normal for each of our scope of practice. What pisses me off is everytime we are in the same room, everyone addresses him first. They assume he's the doctor, and often ignore me completely. Until I speak up because I have the answer to their question, or I'm the one actually managing the problem. They comment on 'how busy/hard working that guy is' because he is walking around all day telling jokes (while I'm seeing patients or documenting). The actual caregivers often contact me after he's seen a patient because he missed or didn't address something. For example, even though he wears his stethoscope on his neck, I have to go behind him and actually order an x-ray or antibiotics because they clearly have pneumonia (which I heard because I actually use my stethoscope. I just clean it and tuck it in my bag after). Then I have to backtrack because he told the family there's no changes, when in fact there was an issue. \n\nI've worked in a similar fashion with LPNs before, and really respect their role. I've worked with LPNs with more experience than I and learned a lot from them. But this is the first white male and also the first situation where I'm ignored or looked at like an assistant or like I'm following his lead on a regular basis.

    "text": "Should I report him to HR? Hi everyone.  I have been working in an all-white office space for the past 2 years or so.  The coworker who I work most closest with is a fake progressive white man who spent nearly every day asking me questions about my racial/ethnic background, sharing gruesome details of minority trauma/suffering stories he has heard on the news to me, or wanting to debate problematic views he has in order to learn from me why they are racist.  For a brief period I think he had a crush on me and he would detail his dating history which included past exes of a similar background to mine (but he doesn’t do this anymore).  I would try to ignore him the first year I was there, and then later onwards I would mention to him in various ways that I did not want to discuss such matters (let’s focus on work, I feel too tired or depressed to talk about this, I find it traumatic to discuss this, I am too busy, etc)\n\nI finally worked up the courage to ask my boss for permission to let me set up a meeting with him and be more direct.  He said ok.  The meeting I had with my coworker went alright - he apologized for his behavior and said he would change although it would be unrealistic for him to be 100 percent perfect overnight.  I said I understood.  It has been about 2 weeks and so far he has left me alone.  Two times since then he said he wanted to mention a story to me but didn’t because it was on a topic I requested him not to discuss, and that the reason he was telling me this was because he wanted me to know he was working on it.  We then went back to discussing work.\n\nMy manager told our director, who then called me into his office to discuss the issue.  He would like me to report this all to HR because he is worried my coworker could do this sort of thing to another person in the future too.  He said that 7 years ago he did something similar to another coworker, and that he only got a slap on the wrist for it, so he wants to show HR what happens when you ignore a situation.  He said that if I report him he will be able to physically separate us so I don’t have to be around him anymore & that he can look into creating a new position for me since they have more money coming into the budget.\n\nShould I report him to HR?  A part of me feels like an asshole for doing so because it seems like he is trying to change now, but another part of me still feels shitty around him (I can’t un-hear some of the things he has said even though I am trying).",

It was a lot more prevalent when I was in grade school, though. I just don’t understand why non-Asian people (particularly white people) can’t just accept “I’m from here” as an answer. I’m not even lying either, I’ve lived in this godforsaken country for two damn decades! I thought about an alternate reality where Asian customers ask white workers where they’re from and probe if they’re Russian, German, etc. A lot of this is also paired with racial compliments and remarks towards how “ethnic” I look. The same customer who asked me where I was from was like, “I would’ve never guessed you were Chinese! You just look like something/got something going on!” and called me “hun” and “gorgeous” within the span of 15 minutes. 🙄 Apparently my work today got a call from some random asking for the name of the “pretty Asian girl who works here” (I have a few other Asian co-workers). The morning shift manager slammed the phone on his ass according to my closing manager. I’ve been the target of a multitude of racial “compliments” since I was in my mid-teens and thought it would stop since it seems like these types of men don’t want older women their age. There is also a customer who regularly comes here and sends money to people in the Philippines and he recently asked for the phone number of my newly 18yo co-worker. 🤩 God, if you exist, give me patience or send the flood.

    "text": "A 25-year old Managing Director applies the best from the East and the West in a podcast interview Rick Hu, who became the youngest Managing Director of Northwestern Mutual at the age of 25, was the keynote speaker at the Asian Hustle Network conference that happened last month in Vegas.\n\nMy friend also interviewed him on his podcast. I wanted to share some highlights on what resonated with me:\n\nImposter syndrome - imagine what it felt like being a 25-year old Managing Director in a room full of 50-year old white men. Rick struggled at first but eventually led his office to becoming the number one district of the company.\n\nRelationship with your parents - Rick earned the respect of his parents through success. At the same time, he remained humble. He was able to build a relationship with his immigrant parents on equal footing and shared with them the abundance over scarcity mindset.\n\nBeing uncomfortable - he cites his successes to his failures, which he goes into deep (like getting put on probation in his first job). It’s amazing how far he’s come.\n\nI think this story is pretty closely tied to the Asian American experience and it’s good to have a role model like Rick to learn from: [https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/afterhourprojects/episodes/Episode-15-Rick-Hu-Mindset-Matters-e24sn74](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/afterhourprojects/episodes/Episode-15-Rick-Hu-Mindset-Matters-e24sn74)",

    "text": "Young men are not being \"indoctrinated.\" Young men are simply disgusted by feminist rhetoric and want nothing to do with you. One of the most persistent myths in feminism is that young men have been overwhelmingly indoctrinated on social media to adopt hateful beliefs towards women. Since Gen Z is one of the most anti-feminist generations since suffragettes were handing men white roses for not being cannon fodder, it actually does raise an interesting question: Why?\n\nThe assumption is that social media has radicalized young men, but this makes zero sense. The feminist outreach on social media is *far* greater than any corner of the so-called manosphere. Feminist messages are constant in movies, music, video games, on TV, on reddit, on Twitter, and everywhere else. It's all Girl Power™ now.\n\nIt isn't that Gen Z males are refusing to listen to feminism. It's that they're listening loud and clear. Despite its resources and following, feminism has managed to be so repulsive and hateful towards young men that they're rejecting it and everything it stands for.\n\nIt's no surprise. Feminists are very clear on one point: they fucking *despise* men. Disproportionate incarceration rates? Celebrated. Male rape? Not a problem to them, especially if the perpetrator is a woman. Male suicide? A talking point to insult men and masculinity. Genital mutilation? Not an issue until it's a girl. Workplace deaths? Combat deaths? Radio silence.\n\nBringing up *any* of the above points also gets you mocked at best. Feminists delight in pointing their fingers at men and laughing at us when we bring up valid points about the hardships men face. They legitimately seem to enjoy laughing at \"fragile masculinity\" and \"male tears.\"\n\nIt just boggles the mind. After all their conduct, and all their abuse hurled towards men, they insist it's other men doing it. How do they not realize that their psychopathic attitudes towards boys and men are what turns us away to them? How can they sit there and claim a couple of talking heads with YouTube channels can drown out the onslaught of feminist messages that barrage boys every day?",

    "text": "White men are actively discriminated against in the job market right now Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm a 32 year old white male in the tech industry. Specifically PM work. I was let go in the mass layoffs months ago by a major tech company that all of you probably know of. I have been in multiple interview rounds with good companies and I have never seen the market this bad for white men ever in my adult career.\n\nJust to preface without sounding like gloating, I have a good resume with solid experience from desirable companies. I've had a number of interviews, and for the positions I want, most hiring managers/majority of panel interviewers have been women, either white or minorities. And oddly enough, every single time I reach the final stages of the interview process and I find myself interviewing with one of these women in a position of power, I get a swift rejection email.\n\nI am cordial, well spoken and friendly. I received two offers from interviews, with the hiring managers/majority of panel members being men but unfortunately they are not companies I am very interested in.\n\n**Two alarming trends I have noticed in tech are that being a white man is an instant negative for most companies**, especially if you find yourself in front of a panel of women or a hiring manager who is a woman. Women are also being promoted to these HM positions in much less time than their male counterparts.\n\n**The other is underqualified women are getting these jobs that white men are competing for at increasing rates.** I checked back for the roles I was rejected for that have been filled and, unsurprisingly, all but one of them were filled by women with less experience than I have.\n\nJust wanted to let other men (white men specifically) that are struggling know that you aren't alone. You don't meet the quotas that these companies have and you are playing against a stacked deck. This is the worst I have ever seen it, and I can only assume it will get worse. I have spoken with close friends and they are experiencing the same thing.\n\nWhite men are being discriminated against in the job market and nobody wants to talk about it.",
