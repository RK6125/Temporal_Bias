    "text": "What boomers and older folks are failing to recognize about wages, the state our economy, and the struggle of younger generations. The following was pulled from answer on Quora by Eris Ke Ku’e. Let me know what you think. Why don’t people want the American Dream anymore - marriage, kids, a dog, and the white picket fence?\nI feel like my husband and I are part of the last American generation to be able to achieve this “American Dream\". We are late Generation Xers. How were we able to make this happen?\n\nMy husband grew up upper middle class. I grew up lower class. He was able to attend college because his parents had the savings to pay for his tuition, room, and board. I was able to attend college mainly on the back of hearty Pell Grants, with a few academic scholarships. We both attended the same well-respected state university and at the time, tuition was a mere $1,500 a semester in state. Our books were about $700 a semester. Room, board and meal plans were crazy affordable.\n\nWe walked out of college completely debt free, him thanks to his parents, me thanks to very affordable tuition, government subsidy, and some work on my part for academic scholarships. We got married Junior year in college. Our apartment was dirt cheap ($400) and I was able to pay for it, along with food, entirely on the back of a part time job. And in 2000, I was a pharmacy tech making $11 an hour. We used public transport and I got dirt cheap birth control from Planned Parenthood. We had cheap student health insurance. We were good.\n\nI graduated with a BSN in nursing and he became a teacher. Neither pay royally, but because we were married, our combined income was adequate to support us. We married young and being a dual income house paved the way for us. We had our first baby, planned, a couple years later, while in a fairly nice apartment, 2 bedrooms, very nice area, for $650 a month in a larger city on the East coast. Simply put, housing was affordable.\n\nNext, we were able to buy a house before the market crash. We moved to a bigger city south of us, and we picked an up and coming area where prices were fractional to established areas. In May of 2005, we picked a lovely 1,800 square foot, 3 bedroom, 2.5 bath house with a loft and a two car garage with a killer master suit on half an acre of wooded land for the absolutely bargain price of $140,000. Did I mention it was a new build with a warrantee? I mean, it was a buyer's market all the way.\n\nAs for financing. Interest rates were incredible. They were handing out loans like candy. We got an 80/20 loan at 0% down at a 4% interest rate on the main and a 4.5% interest rate on the 20%. The first mortgage was a 30 year and the second mortgage was a 15 year. Our total house payment, after taxes and insurance, was around $1,000. Retrospectively, the loan process was a ridiculous breeze. We obviously did not get stuck with a subprime loan and we didn’t buy a house that was overpriced. We were certainly lucky, not so much wise. These loans with those rates simply do not exist anymore.\n\nThen the market crashed. We had another child and we soon decided that we wanted to get rid of our second mortgage and get a 15 year fixed loan. However, the game had changed. We eventually succeeded, but the sheer difficulty of this process post crash was insane. Even though we were not a risk, the mortgage company needed years of financial statements, years of tax returns, so many paystubs, freaking statements from our employers that we were not at risk of being terminated, even multiple property appraisals. You can see how if someone is just starting out and trying to buy a home, they very well might not have years and years of solid employment and financials. I could see where the industry was coming from, but if a very stable, middle class couple was struggling with a refinance, what on earth would a single person, or a person of less money or weaker employment do?\n\nAnd to put things in perspective, even though I was a pharmacy tech almost 20 years ago in college, current pharmacy techs aren't even making $11 an hour! Two decades later! Their pay is seemingly going backwards. All while the tuition for the university I attended has over quadrupled for in state tuition! If I were in the exact same boat today, I absolutely would not have become a middle class homeowner. Government subsidies for education have dropped, the interest rates for loans are up, you cannot claim your interest on taxes anymore, and tuition is absolutely through the roof.\n\nIf I were in school now, there would be zero way I would be able to walk away with a college degree and no debt. No way could I only have worked part time to pay for housing. No way would I find an apartment that affordable. The same apartment I lived in 15 years ago is now $1,100 a month. And guess what? Wages have not risen enough to offset that cost. And Lord knows what I would have done for birth control because that particular Planned Prenthood had to close its doors.\n\nI'm no economist, historian, or sociologist. I only know my experience. And looking at the cost of things overall today, mixed with the poor growth in wages, I'd be screwed as a millennial today. To put it into perspective, in 10 years, the price of our first house has gone up a full $100,000. The area developed, but it certainly didn’t turn into anything terribly different from when we lived there.\n\nThat being said, as a nurse, in the ten years since we bought that house, my wages have gone up exactly $3/hr. My husband has not gotten a raise in 7 years. That's right. Seven years and not even a 1% bump. But his insurance has gone up and his benefits have decreased, as have mine. At the price it is now, we would not be buying that house with our current incomes in this current economy. Due to the rise of insurance, we are both taking home less money than we were 7 years ago. That certainly feels counter intuitive.\n\nSo, yeah. The masses aren't reaching for the American Dream anymore because everybody knows the American Dream is much harder to reach than it was 15 years ago. People have had to compromise. Maybe you can afford education but not a house. Maybe you aren't lucky to afford even an education. Maybe you're in a field where wages are frozen. Maybe you aren't married and you don’t have the perk of a dual income. Maybe, maybe, maybe, there are a thousand maybes.\n\nAnd all of this isn’t even considering the fact that perhaps this new generation has different goals. Maybe they would rather travel than own property frozen in one place. Maybe they want to be at the top of their field rather than at home raising kids. Maybe they just want to be able to eat and have a roof over their head, because in this economy, that truly is considered a success.\n\nSo I say, we kind of ruined the fact that the American Dream used to really be the American Reality. Now, younger generations have a different reality to face, and we should not be judging them on making choices that make more sense in this new reality that they face. They are having to make new dreams, because the old dream is rapidly dying.",

    "text": "I'm going insane trying to get a job. Howdy folks, sorry for the upcoming rant/essay. But I think I must have messed up my chances of ever finding a job. So yea, a possibility of a future living on food stamps and sleeping on the street might actually happen, which has got me very badly freaked out.\n\nEssentially, I'm currently a highly disillusioned undergrad rising senior with a useless major (history). The plan was to go to graduate school for education and become a teacher, but some recent financial issues in my family scuttled that plan - plus the fact that while I definitely tried in school, I didn't try my absolute best to be honest, so my grades are mediocre but nowhere close enough to get any scholarships or anything, or get into one of the big-name schools that would be worth shelling out deep student loans for. With how useless my history degree is going to be alone now that I've lost the original plan, I've just started falling apart academically. I've literally spent my entire life studying and writing, and I haven't learned any skills that anyone would pay me for. I'll literally just have a fancy piece of scrap paper, and a bunch of papers and essays that are only worth the few bucks I might be able to earn from selling them to some other student to copy, I guess. This isn't the 19th century, you can't get paid to be a thinker or a man of letters anymore. Should've taken computer science I guess. What the hell was I thinking?\n\nIn a final act of desperation, I shotgunned out almost 400 applications to various internships that I might remotely qualify for, since this summer would be the last one before graduation. At least one internship might be better than none. The previous three summers I spent working as a teacher overseas, but with the shutdown of my teacher plan, I need some sort of other experience to give myself a fighting chance at finding any other white collar job. After all of these applications - which I made sure to custom-write cover letters and resumes for each single one - I got a single interview. Within a week I figured out was just a MLM scheme, so I ended up not taking that. So there goes any chance at entering an office job at all.\n\nFine, so I suppose I have zero chance at getting an office job. But at the very least, maybe I can get some unskilled blue collar job? They don't pay as well, but at least I've have a tiny chance of actually being able to live. Once again, I began shotgunning applications (although this time I kept it to within a 20 mile radius of the city where I live, because I'm not moving cross country for minimum wage). Obviously I don't have the skills or the background to apply for any of the skilled blue collar work, so plumbing and elevator repair and stuff like that was obviously out of the running, but pretty much everything else that didn't explicitly ask for educational requirements beyond high school or work experience was fair game for me.\n\nOut of around 150 applications I fired out, I only got responses from maybe 15 or so. I use \"applications\" lightly, since for some of these (like roofing - literally the one job that supposedly takes high school dropouts) literally ask you to just call a number.\n\nOut of the 15 or so that actually responded, I got 0 offers. Literally nothing. Now admittedly I can perhaps understand why I might get rejected from construction - I don't have an OSHA 10 card, and my only relevant experience comes from helping a cousin finish his basement, so the clerk at Home Depot probably has more qualifications than I do.\n\nWhat really drives me mad though is the fact that I got rejected from jobs high schoolers take on summer break - somehow, I got rejected from Burger King. 7-Eleven at least gave me an \"interview\", where I gave the standard generic answers to all of their questions, then said they'd call me, and obviously never did. What makes me even more mad is that they literally had a giant sign on the outside saying that they were urgently hiring. Should've said \"Urgently Hiring, except for You\". And of course, they never told me why I got rejected.\n\nThe only job that told me why I got fired was a small veteran-owned flooring company; while they were looking for people to commit for a career, and I was just looking for summer work (for now), I called them anyway since they literally had \"we need people\" on the bottom of their job posting. Seemed to be going well at first, despite my initial short-term schedule I was completely willing to return once I graduated and keep working for them, and I made sure to let them know that. They asked the standard interview questions, I talked a little about how I wanted to learn a skill and find some honest work, and they sounded pretty happy to take me on - talking a ton about what the schedule was like, what my duties would be, the pay, and an approximate timeframe of when they wanted me to start figuring out how to do the job. While the pay was pretty low, it was an honest job, and once I started learning the ropes I would be earning bonuses and raises, so I was fine with it too. Right before the end of the call they asked me a bit about why I was only looking for a summer job, which was when I let slip that I was in college. The tone of the entire conversation changed right there; all of a sudden they weren't talking as much and were clearly trying to end the call. I suppose as a veteran-owned company with a ton of combat vets on payroll, they probably look at millennial college-goers like me as complete cupcakes unwilling to get our hands dirty or work more than a minute straight without looking at our phones. I legitimately wanted to learn a skill so at least I'd have some options for a job after graduation, and this company would have been a great opportunity to learn at least something employable. Obviously they never said that me going to college was the issue, but judging by the way they talked before and after, it's probably that.\n\nIronically, the only job I really ever had, at a coffee store, I ended up quitting. My parents still firmly believe in the old \"any degree gets you any basic job, you don't need to worry about internships or your major\". Probably worked in 1980, but definitely doesn't work now. While they paid for most of the bill for college, I decided to get a job at that coffee store just so I wouldn't have to take so many student loans. But pretty quickly my parents started complaining that I was clearly not trying at school, because after all, this job was a \"loser job\", that only drug addicts or ex-cons or whatever do, and if I just spent my entire time studying I could land a \"proper job\". Eventually they threatened to kick me out of the house if I kept working there, so I quit. Of course, now my degree is going to be nearly worthless, and I can't get a job anywhere to save my life.\n\nSo I have the wrong major and no relevant experience for entry level jobs or internships (even being the guy that just makes photocopies of stuff all day, Jesus!). Somehow I keep getting rejected for fast food, service, and retail jobs. And by just going to college, I've been basically blacklisted by blue collar jobs. And now I don't have the finances to go to grad school. Or the motivation for that matter. I've felt my motivation to do anything academic just completely collapse over the last few months. Going to grad school with my current mental state might just result in me flunking out. I feel completely disgusted with myself. All I've done for my entire life since first grade is study and write, and that's gotten me absolutely nowhere. The news keeps repeating that restaurants need workers. Construction folks keep talking about how they need more laborers. Every single retail store I've seen has hiring signs up. And for some reason they just don't want me. Yes, I'm aware that they have no obligation to hire me, but what the hell am I qualified to do? Why does even fast food reject me? I don't have tattoos or anything, I dress and look reasonably neat, I don't have any major physical disabilities, I'm literally just a typical 21-year-old human male. I've got no criminal history or anything else I can think of that would immediately disqualify me from a job. I'm polite and smile when I come in, and I don't do any drugs. I'm willing to show up on time and do my job. Somehow that's not what they're looking for.\n\nI'm literally going crazy. I can understand why I might not get a job as an office assistant (with all the other \"useless major\" grads fighting for any white collar job available), but how the hell am I getting rejected by Walmart and McDonald's of all places? Help me out folks, can anyone think of anything else I'm missing here? I'm just depressed as hell. I started out as a freelance musician while in high school making decent money before an injury, then I taught English abroad making really good money before this, and now I'm staring at the possibility that I might not be able to get a paycheck at all. God, how the hell did I mess up so badly in four years? I'll stop ranting now.\n\ntl:dr what are possible reasons why an average-ish person might get rejected from manual labor or fast food jobs?",

    "text": "Does anyone have any tips on how to move on from a traumatic work experience? I was let go from my previous job where the work environment was toxic and systemic racism was around. Even though the organization is a rather small nonprofit, every few months, it seems like someone or groups of people would be let go - and not a lot of people would know why as there were no formal performance reviews ever. Despite that, I spent a few years there building my role and outperforming quite a bit in comparison to other similar roles in other organizations. I did this working extra hours often and covering roles as needed despite not being paid for it, as going above and beyond was the norm. There was a culture of bullying where the executives would judge people on what they wore, their weight and such. They forced people to always be \"positive\" and they wanted things to be sugar coated and a culture of fake happy is promoted. This is in addition to reckless spending that everyone was supposed to be ok with.  Because of this and the fact that people were always being let go, everyone was on edge and when COVID-19 started, that made me on edge too. People started to backstab each other, like one of my direct reports started to backstab me by saying things about me to my superior - that said I have never done anything that betrayed my integrity. This way of management is hidden behind a the mission, and because of the marketing of the mission, funds keep coming in despite poor staff treatment and management. \n\nThe hardest pill to swallow is the advancement opportunities here. As a BIPOC person, I never received any advancement opportunities. However, everyone who is white seems to be advanced continuously. For example, the executive director's assistant was promoted 3 times in 2 years and despite them not having the merit or leadership abilities to really warrant a senior level position. \n\nThe day I was let go, I remember going into the office and a cab was waiting for me outside. It was a 3 minute conversation where they told me my position was eliminated for business reasons and then papers were asked of me to sign. I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye or clean up or anything. It was so traumatic. \n\nI am worried if I move into another role at another organization, I am worried about the following things:\n\n* If I moved into a similar role at another organization, how would I answer why I left?\n* What if I run into the person who takes my role after me, how would I confront them (mind you - the person before me was let go too)?\n* I feel a lot of injustice still, and lots of anger and resentment, but because I signed papers (I learned now that you have to talk to a lawyer before you sign an employment contract and after) I can't say anything to anyone. What can I do to get my justice back?\n* I can't help but blame myself and look for what I did wrong, but I know it's not me. It's just a hard pill for me to swallow.",

I have previous experience and everything is the same where I worked before so no challenges. They only give me 36 hours a week which they split the hours into 6 days and I have no real freedom. We do solo shifts which is easy though.\n\nIt all started with my manager's boss, he would edit my hours to save payroll. When I realized and brought it up, my manager's boss said he would fix it and never did and my manager who is always friendly told me I shouldn't bring it up to higher ups otherwise it could make me lose my job. Well her boss got fired and was replaced by someone who ain't better. \n\nHer new boss assumed that one of us is being stealing merchandise because the inventory numbers were wrong and I feel like they assumed it was me.

It happened 2 weeks ago and only o once and I just got a write-up. \n\nWhen I  brought up being working so much and taking care of the store and covering, they did not care.

    "text": "Recent job rejection received, being an Asain woman was accused lacking confidence Hello all, this is actually my first time posting here, just wanna get some opinions here. Recently I received a job application, the email is attached in the post. I'll briefly introduce the background, basically, this is a local UK company, consulting, small size(50ish people), not diversity (all employees are white, 90% are men). I'm an Asain female, recent graduate, with a relevant degree, qualifications, and based on what they said, an amazing resume. In the first few interviews, they seem very nice, very keen to hire someone. I just went my last interview on Friday last week, it was a coffee interview, not very formal. I was being very honest, calm, and showed my professionalist and confidence. Today I got this rejection. I honestly feel quite insulting, I was trying to build a connection with the person at the meeting but it has to happen from both ends, and they have accused me failed their effort. What I feel is that the truth is they are just not used to receive a calm honest and confident Asian woman, and they don't know how to interpret it. \n\nThe whole fact I just realized now is that the people they have and people they are looking for are always white men, who were growing in a space where society just encourages them to always bragging about themselves, showing off, and talk about themselves all the time. I'm not that kind of person and I don't want to be like that. The whole thing for me is that I showed my confidence but if they don't feel comfortable because they don't use to diversity. If it's because I'm lacking some specific experience or practical shortage I'm totally fine to get rejected but this just doesn't make sense to me. I don't know what's their standard but they can't judge me based on white men's level, that was not fair. \n\nI'm jusy very down like honestly everytime I thought something good will happen it just won't, and I don't know how to deal with it, now I feel like this kind of rejection really hurts my confidence. I just kept questioning myself is it really my fault? I used to believe I'm good at communicating and every feedback I received were saying i'm fun, confident and nice to get along. I didn't understand where did this go wrong...Feel I might need some help here.",

I'm certain that there are millions of women across the globe who would have liked to share the impact your father's life had, and will continue to have, on them.\n\nIn 1990, Lawrence Lockman, a Republican member of the Maine House of Representatives wrote, while serving as director of the Pro-Life Education Association, [\"If a woman has (the right to abortion), why shouldn't a man be free to use his superior strength to force himself on a woman?

But, nevertheless, we have to make the best out of a bad situation.\"](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/santorum-to-rape-victims-make-the-best-out-of-a-bad-situation-a8388910c907/)  Apparently, in the case of rape, it's a gift.  It's a horribly created gift, yet nonetheless, a gift.  However, in the case of incest, it's what?  Just a regular, everyday gift?  A normal byproduct of a fully-functional family life?\n\nAlso in 2012, Richard Mourdock, a Republican candidate at the time running for Senate in Indiana, stated, [\"...I came to realize life is that gift from God.  And I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.\"](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/richard-mourdock-even-pregnancy-from-rape-something-god-intended/)\n\nIn 2014, Montana Judge Todd Baugh sentenced a 54-year-old, admitted child molester, convicted of repeatedly raping his 14-year-old female student, who committed suicide during the course of the trial, to 30 days in jail.  At sentencing, he stated that the victim [\"seemed older than her chronological age\" and was \"as much in control of the situation\"](https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/29/protesters-demand-montana-judge-resign-over-rape-sentencing/) as her rapist.  One month later, in an interview, he defended his decision, stating, \"Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent.  I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape.  It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.\"  [He also added that her death complicated the case](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/28/teacher-rape-montana/2722817/).\n\nIn 2019, a Tennessee Judge Steven Sword sentenced former pastor, David Richards, to 12 years in prison, 60 short of the maximum prosecutors had sought, for repeatedly having raped his adopted daughter over the course of two years, beginning when she was 14-years-old.  Richards maintained his innocence throughout trial, attempting to portray his victim as a rebellious teenager, who only made the allegations, after he had imposed strict rules for his children.  However, his DNA profile was lifted from a seminal fluid sample recovered from the girl's bed frame.\n\n[The judge, in handing down his lenient sentence, stated that he took into account Richard's longtime ministry, the Bible study he began in jail while awaiting trial, and the community support he received from family, friends, and fellow Christians](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/crime/2019/05/09/former-pastor-nets-12-year-prison-term-rape-adopted-daughter-david-lynn-richards/1143006001/).\n\nAt sentencing, over 30 friends and parishioners sat on Richard's side of the courtroom in support of him, while only six appeared for his victim.  One of those appearing on behalf of Richards to argue for sentencing leniency, David Thompson, who shared ministerial duties w/ Richards at their church, said, [\"I find it impossible for me to believe he's guilty of this. His business needs him. His family needs him. Our church needs him.\"](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/crime/2019/05/09/former-pastor-nets-12-year-prison-term-rape-adopted-daughter-david-lynn-richards/1143006001/)  Clearly, his family needs him, since he's such a wonderful father.\n\nAnd, of course, there's the new breed of vitriolic misogynists who, in a single breath, deny rape culture while proliferating it w/ their toxic ideology.  They refer to themselves as \"[Western chauvinists](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys),\" but in reality, [they're nothing but neo-Nazi terrorists](https://www.timesofisrael.com/not-nazi-enough-proud-boys-leader-wants-group-to-fully-embrace-white-supremacy/), and [that's all they've ever been](https://www.adl.org/blog/proud-boys-bigotry-is-on-full-display), so don't be fooled by their rhetoric.  They've now taken to wearing suits and ties and [holding yearly conventions that promise to make \"men masculine again,\" while \"Making Women Great Again.\"](https://the21convention.org/)  Since last year's conference was such disgrace, [this year's conference promises to be an even more hatefully misogynistic experience w/ 17 featured speakers, and in a first, they're actually going to allow to women to speak](https://22convention.com/)!\n\n>Women today are being taught to act more like men. Where has that led us? Skyrocketing rates of broken families, a documented decline in female happiness since the 1970s, endless social and dating dysfunction, and America at the #1 spot in the world for single motherhood. No longer will you have to give in to toxic bullying feminist dogma and go against your ancient, biological nature as a woman, great men and women have arrived to help #MWGA.\n\nIt's pretty clear that this toxicity has led to a rape culture that's just intolerable, and this is just a snapshot of what's taking place in America.  [Gender-based violence has rooted itself in some of the most populous countries in the world, and the problem only appears to be getting worse](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/southasiasource/understanding-rape-culture-in-bangladesh-india-pakistan/).  In other parts of the world, the abuse of women is absolutely horrific, [akin to something the Third Reich did to Jews in the death camps](https://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1233&context=history-in-the-making).  In 2016, an [Indian woman from the state of Rajasthan was gangraped by her husband and his two brothers](https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india-woman-gangraped-by-husband-in-laws-tattooed-with-expletives-over-dowry-336883), then tattooed across her forehead and hands/arms w/ expletives, b/c her family failed to meet the husband's dowry demands.  In 2018, [a 17-year-old Moroccan girl was abducted, tortured, and gangraped by 13 men over the course of two months](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/8/27/morocco-outcry-after-girl-is-raped-tattooed-with-swastikas).  They burned her w/ cigarettes and tattooed her all over her body, including w/ symbols of swastikas.\n\nThis could go on (and on and on and on and on), but there's only so much space available on the Internet.  What's clear is that those who perpetuate this violent culture are the same who propose and legislate the wholly ineffectual laws designed to deal w/ this problem, and they're also those who enforce, prosecute, and adjudicate said laws.  In a sense, it's allowing predators to sit in judgment of predators, while, at the same time, giving them the option to dismiss those they victimize.  I'd say that it's a broken system, except that it's not.  It's a system that's working exactly in the way in which it was intended.",

    "text": "For all the Texan woman who plan on voting against the abortion bill ( a warning) I warned y'all about this [Texas bill a few months before it went into effect](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/nvrbp6/i_had_a_meeting_with_texas_state_legislators_8/) , and I'm here with another warning to every Texas woman who wants to fight this bill by overturning it by getting rid of it's sponsers and kicking em out of office at the ballot box by voting.  \n\nYour right to vote to change this is in as much danger as your chance to obtain an abortion.  \nThey are targeting areas with people likely to vote against the abortion bill.\nThey are putting in restrictions that might strip a lot of y'all from the right to vote.\n\n[I'm an election judge](http://imgur.com/a/Rgnc6uv), (that's my election judge pin )so here's what y'all need to do to not get your voting rights taken away as well: \n\n-Y'all NEED to check your voter registration status more than 6 weeks before every election.  Look up your\" county\"+\"election office\" and it should bring up your website \nShould any issues arise, or they took you off the voting rolls illegally, you should be able to get it taken care of within 2 weeks. 1 month before the election you wish to vote. If it's not taken care of by that deadline, your vote won't be counted. (Harrisvotes.org is the website for Houston /Harris county, Montgomery County is Montgomeryvotes.org,  if this post gets any traction,  I'll list the top 25 most populous county  sites)\n\n-If you move, change your name or want to register to vote: you should be able to obtain a short form Secretary of State voter registration form at many post offices, libraries, Texas Department of Public Safety offices, and Texas Health and Human Services Commission offices throughout the state. If you move within the county, you should be able to still vote at any early voting locations.  The local Democratic and Republican party headquarters are also likely to carry them.\n\n-If you have issues/or think you might have issues with your voter registration and can't verify it, contact a local voter registrar. You can ask your local League of Women Voters,  either the local Democratic or Republican party and ask about any events with a \"VDR\". Last but not least, contact your local election office.  (This can be the most time consuming option)\n\n-If you are denied voter registration by a VDR(Voter Deputy Registrar) because of partisan affiliation or if they try to have voter registration events for anti-choice voters only, that is still illegal. \n\n-They plan on having partisan jerks bothering voters and intimidating them. They are not allowed to film you in a manner that shows how you vote. They are not allowed to bother, harrass or attempt to influence your vote. They should have a nametag with their name, if your rights are violated, you need to mark down their names, go 100ft (there should be markers, they might just be plain white signs(outside the polling location and then call your local county election office report it. Then call the Secretary of State election line. The Democrats should also have a line set up to report violations. \n\n- If you want to help prevent voter harassment, sign up to be a pollwatcher and keep a record of any violations. \n\n-If you are a naturalized citizen(or being honest, have a common Hispanic name), or prior felon you are especially vulnerable.  \n\n\nAlso, try to geta government photo id. They cannot ask you specifically for a driver's license.  \n\nDo not wear any clothing that can be construed as a political messaging in favor of a candidate or measure . It can be up to individual judges discretion, and if you're in an area that voted conservative in the last gubernatorial election- you've got a presiding judge not likely to be friendly. \n\n\nLastly,  if you have issues concerning your voter registration and are having trouble getting in contact with your election office and have tried all the resources I listed, you can contact me (as long as it's at least 6 weeks before election day) and I'll reach out to my contacts to try and get y'all taken care of.\n\nTldr: You need to check your voter registration 6 weeks before elections, because their next move is stripping people of their voters rights.",

    "text": "My Fiancé's brother is a gross manchild Posting here because I really need to vent or I'm going to go crazy!\n\nI've been with my fiancé for 5 1/2 years but we've never spent that much time with her family until this year. Last year during covid her mum was diagnosed with incurable cancer so this year we've been visiting for 1-2 weeks every other month.\n\nI've always known her brother is a manchild and been irritated by him, but recently it's gone to a whole other level.\n\nHe's 32 years old and has always lived at home with his parents. Previously he had a long distance relationship with a woman in Cambodia that seemed to mostly involve him sending vast amounts of money to her. (My fiancé raised the fact this was a massive scam but was told she was \"heartless\" by her mum and dad). When that ended a few years ago (turned out she had a lot of western \"boyfriends\" kinda fair play to her in a way) we hoped he would finally get his shit together and move out.\n\nThat clearly hasn't happened. His parents do pretty much everything for him. I mean EVERYTHING. Bear in mind his dad is 61 and a full time carer for his dying mum. They cook all his meals, they do his laundry (and collect it from the floor of his room), they change his bedsheets, they wash his dishes, they clean the whole house including his (disgusting)bedroom. \n\nBrief rant about the bedroom. I've never been inside but he leaves the door open and you can see his clothes strewn across the floor, white stains on his desk chair and tissues all around. It makes me want to vomit thinking about it.\n\nHe also walks around the house in dirty clothes that don't fit him which means we all have to see his hairy fat belly hanging out. (No fat shaming, I am overweight and working on it. The issue is the lack of social awareness around clothes and hygiene). Despite this he brags about burning thousands of calories at the gym (sure) and is always eating protein bars or shakes.\n\nThe one thing he does is occasionally cook them a fried breakfast on weekends, which of course his mum is expected to clean up. Whenever he does the slightest thing for them he is expected to be heaped with praise.\n\nHe has worked full time in a professional good paying job for years, but what does he offer to his family? About £400 a month. That's for food, lodging and no housework required. To put that into perspective that's less than half just the rent my fiancé and I pay, forget bills and food. \n\nSo what does he do with all that money? Well instead of saving to move out (he literally could have bought a house by now) he spends it all on his car, video games and stupid \"projects\" that never come to anything (like an expensive microphone and video camera for his short lived YouTube channel). \n\nWhen we come back we work really hard to cook, clean and wash to make sure her mum can have a break (her dad can't cook) and to overall support them. We also pay for the shopping and help to pay for some meals out (normally over 50% plus tip). This includes (to my regret) having to cook for her brother who has not once offered to clear the table or help with the dishes.\n\nThis would all be somewhat tolerable if he was actually a half decent human being. But he's also a careless, misogynistic PoS.\n\nWhenever there is something he doesn't like or doesn't want to hear, regardless of how small it is, he will get angry, shout, sulk and slam doors. My fiancé has told me that her mum has said she is frightened of him.\n\nHe is also a massive misogynist. He refers to a female colleague as \"the Rottweiler\" because she has red hair is allegedly ugly (whatever the hell that even means) and \"talks too much\". When discussing my fiancé's relationship with me he compared it to their aunt and grandmother because \"whenever two women get together there is always trouble\" despite the fact my fiancé and I were perfectly happy and relaxed. He also made a joke that \"the Chinese symbol for conflict is two women under one roof\" which i challenged as untrue, sexist and racist. He said \"It is true, I know a lot about this stuff actually\" (it definitely isn't true but w/e). \n\nIn the past (thank gods not around me) he used to threatened to kill, strangle and beat my fiancé. Call her a bitch, \"a little slut\" (for going on a date) and a whore. His go to insults always seem to be gendered.\n\nWhenever challenged or questioned about his behaviour he says he can't help it and we shouldn't judge him because of his aspergers. (Aspergers isn't even a recognised diagnosis here, it's just called ASD but he insists on calling it aspergers as he claims to be \"high functioning\" and to have special \"advantages\" about his intelligence). This is just clearly untrue. \n\nFor one I work with and have worked with people with ASD. They might seem a bit odd sometimes, be a bit blunt or see things in a different way but they are fully capable of being functioning adults who manage their own lives. They can be polite at work, good at their jobs and supportive to their families. \n\nApparently his mum and dad have bought into this as whenever I or my fiancé mentions anything to her dad he says he can't help it.\n\nWhat makes this worse is the family put massive pressure on my fiancé to always be kind, emotionally forgiving and practically supportive. They expect her to do care giving tasks,  they also criticize her for having an \"attitude\" if she ever disagrees or is unhappy with her father. (Her dad is a whole other story).\n\nIt just makes me miserable to have to put up with this manchild when my fiancé and I are spending a lot of time, effort and money to travel and support her family. Plus we see him splurging cash on his boy toys when we are struggling by to get enough money for our wedding (we only want a small ceremony of like 20 people and no formal reception service, but even that is a lot of money to us).\n\nI don't get it at all. The double standard between how their expect her to act and what he gets away with is galling. Especially when her parents seem to love and appreciate him more than they do her, despite her bending over backwards for them.\n\nI honestly wish I never had to come here, but I know it's so important to my fiancé and I will always support her 100%.\n\nAnyway... rant over!\n\nFeel free to share your experiences of idiot brothers or brothers in law.\n\nMuch love xxxx\n\n\nEdit: In case it wasn't clear we are both women.",

    "text": "Loving him was like having a toothache (why women stay: emotional abuse) [Trigger Warning] Thoughts I've had on emotional abuse and control in relationships. I hope this helps someone. Something from my experience to the other lovely women out there who might be conflicted about why they are staying or did stay with someone who hurt them.\n\n(Content warning: emotional abuse)\n\n///\n\nThe dentist is impressed by your pain tolerance. You do not have the heart to tell him that someone taught you everything you know about how to push pain down, how easy it is to soothe something wrong if you need it badly enough.\n\n\"High tolerance.\" You explain it away neatly. You are good at that now.\n\nYou have often thought about how to describe your time with him. How many women have tried to explain why they have stayed with a man who hurt them? It is harder still when you have no bruises except the ones inside. Men go through this sometimes, but let's talk about you.\n\nLoving him was a permanent toothache. The first, distant pang begins on day one but your feelings are so high you can't feel it. When you fall head over heels for him, you believe. Your first mistake and it's not even your fault. Sometimes you are spinning so fast in love that you fail to take things in beneath the rose-colored glow. You gaze toward your lover like the sun but he stares out at the horizon away from you. You are already one step behind and you can't grasp this until the ache truly sets in.\n\nA month in. He's not good at emotions. He is broken from his past. You breathe in. You soothe the pain yourself. Your eyes are too filled with lust and love to see much else.\n\nTwo months in. You do not like the way he talks to other women. Don't you know that he's just an open person? You could be as open as him, if it wasn't for your past and your sad childhood. He tells you about his lovely family. He invites you into such a bright light. \"Won't this be nice?\" he asks. When he brings you closer, you can feel the dull ache begin to recede. \"Come live with me.\" It's the other side of the country. A lump settles in your throat, a civil war beginning in your body.\n\nHe tells you this is something special. You exhale. Your gut has not been the same since day one, but perhaps that's what *real* love feels like. You wait until he falls asleep to Google why you're miserable. Why is it so bad if everything around you says he so good?\n\nAnd then the mask slides a bit more. He grows weary of the way your hand feels in his at times. He has hinted you are too intense. It makes you want to please him, to gain back the way he looked at you like you might be magic.\n\nInky. Like metallic bile when the first hint of pain hits in the back of your teeth. When he tell you that he can't promise not to cheat on you after you move mountains for him. It is six months in. You have moved somewhere new, somewhere he has asked you to. No friends, no families, only allies within his community surround you. He promised you a family, the kind from storybooks. The birds watch you from their branches. *Foolish girl*.\n\nWorse, the infatuation never tears right down the middle even in that moment. You try to explain his cruel words away. He has been hurt. (Your brain, gently: You have too. Why is that easy to forget?) Your love only wears away slowly like a stone in the stream. Too difficult to tell when someone watches from the outside looking in, but a bomb knows when it begins ticking.\n\nHe tells you that you don't need anti-depressants. You have him, his family, this life. Isn't that nice? Everyone around you seems to think so. They don't see the way he turns away from you on purpose at parties, ignoring you to chat with his friends and even to flirt. When you try to call him on it, he convinces you that you're misunderstanding. You fall asleep at night feeling like a fool but needing the pain to stop. You reach out to him in the shared bed. Anything to make it stop. Anything to make you feel like you are enough. When did the pain become daily?\n\nYou know now that this is how men like him operate. They do not even realize it at times, but they have a pattern. Swoop in on a woman a little too lost, inject her with something like love, and pull her in so that he controls. Your search results suggest narcissism. You do not believe he even realizes what he did.\n\n\"Don't worry about her,\" he insists when you catch him turning his phone away late at night with a message from another woman. He reminds you of all the gifts he has given you, of all the things you will do. This is important. When your tooth begins to ache, he tips your head back to look at the stars. He etches visions within them. \"Look at what we will do together.\"\n\nHis promises are the drug that hits your system. Suddenly, the ache is gone. Replaced by a blissful feeling that makes you feel like floating.\n\nRinse and repeat. This is how he keeps you. Your only price for a pain-free life is worship. The resentment eats at you. He tells you that his sister thinks you're insane at times. You see her smiling face at dinner. It is hard to tell where the lies begin and start, so you just sink into the background. This is how he likes it. He likes that you believe everyone is on his side. While you face his family, he stitches new strings into your back for him to pull. It is almost a relief to be a puppet.\n\n\"Don't gossip about me to your friends back home,\" he snaps when you say you're upset about something cruel he said. You said your friend agreed he was wrong. He cuts you off from everything. He tells you that he is your only anchor, your only home. Your hands shake terribly when you go the bathroom during meals. It hurts more and more. You don't know how to make it stop hurting. You feel like you could faint at times.\n\nThe pain is so much that you push to move. The ache is too much even for his reluctant kiss to heal after an argument where he has again convinced you that you're crazy. He agrees. You need friends, you insist. He humors you. You settle somewhere else, where you have more access to people. You go out and make friends. You tell him you're getting a therapist. His sunny smile turns rotten.\n\n\"What do you need to talk to a therapist for?\"\n\nYou do not know how eyes go to warm to cold this quickly, but your limit closes in. A man can convince you he is a demigod but he cannot hide the way he limps when he feels tired.\n\nYou get the fucking therapist. You work your ass off to pay the bills. For three months, you are nursing the pain every day, until winter comes rushing upon you. It spits you up with a fierceness. Yet another holiday where he says you ruined everything, never mind that he ignored you yet again during a party to see you squirm. He places land mines under your feet and grows upset when they go off. You are too much, too sensitive. You are the saddest person in the world. You are no longer smart and brilliant like he thought. He gives you his love as if it's a gift from charity. He makes you grovel for it.\n\nIf the devil approached Eve in the garden to tempt her, you know the stories are wrong. He did not appear as a snake. He appeared as something much worse: a human being with open arms that asked where it hurt. You had no idea the man you loved was mapping out your every flaw when he gets you to open up. Each story is an X he marks in his brain for him to circle back to when he needs to attack. You cannot explain the anger you feel toward him, grow embarrassed of it. Your therapist asks if you're okay. You cannot tell her about how he sent a glass flying during a fight. You are protecting him even from her.\n\nBut something strange shifts in you as you continue to work on yourself. You no longer need to touch his back at night. The pain is still there, but you are sitting with it. The tooth screams. You press your tongue against it, curious instead of terrified.\n\nYou grow stronger. He buckles beneath your new-found independence. He hates the way you no longer worship him. He punishes you for it: not inviting you to certain events, criticizing you over small things, gossiping about you to his friends. He is obsessed with his own image. It's as if he hangs a portrait of himself in your shared living room and polishes it each day, whispering that your greasy fingers are the only reason his image is marred. He grows more distant, hides his phone. You wonder if you should worry that it's another woman, that you're ending up like all the other women before despite all the crocodile tears he has shed for you.\n\nAnd then you do something for the first time.\n\nYou do not ask for the relief. You do not go toward him. He grows further from you. You love him terribly, how could you not? He continues to spin that you are the problem and that he is innocent of everything. He gaslights, he gaslit. He pulls out all the stops. You do not yield. The pain is as bad as ever and yet, there is a stronger voice inside you now that reminds you that you are worthy of the very love you have always given him.\n\n\"I don't love you anymore.\" He tells you that.\n\nYou cry. He drops this line after a normal week. How does a man fuck you and tell you that you're going to build a life together only to dump you a few days later? Should you feel guilty because you didn't grovel? He gives you a list of your faults in the aftermath. For a mad minute, you believe him. You flee from your home together, from your life. There is the trouble of getting home. There is the trouble of the tooth searing like white hot heat in your mouth. No drugs. It would be so easy to beg him to come back to you, but the voice inside you will not let you.\n\nYou are a woman undone. You crumble into rock bottom and the pain... it grows worse than you ever knew.\n\nHe already moves on to the woman he had on the side. She was one of the ones not to \"worry\" about, he said. You blot out the image of them together while you sob in your new apartment, terrified, and try not to imagine her tilting her head back to look into the sky for their new grand promise. You cannot feel anything but grief for her as you mourn your younger self alongside all of it. Your anger against him threatens to consume you.\n\nBut you are stronger, aren't you?\n\nBit by bit.\n\nAnd toothaches cannot bother you if you learned how to fix them.\n\nYou rip the tooth clean out. The voice inside you cheers. You will heal. You never look for signs of him on the internet. He begins to harass you, demanding your attention. He wants so badly for you to crack like a ship at sea, wants to see you drown in the waters of your own misery.\n\nYou cry every single hour for months. It gets better. You drown yourself in vices at time. The gaping hole where the tooth was reminds you it was real. You push yourself forward. He howls in the distance. You stuff your ears up and focus on your computer screen. Job application, move, new life.\n\nYou charge to the horizon. You no longer need the pain to stop. You have become the pain and pushed through it.\n\nThe dentist tells you that you're all done. It was quick. Just a few appointments to put in the new tooth.\n\nYou do not tell him that it goes much deeper than that, that you yourself have rooted out an ache that ran straight to your heart.\n\nWhen someone asks you why you stayed with him, you can almost feel that old pain again. You run your tongue along the new tooth, reminding yourself that you're safe and whole and loved. People can judge but they will never understand the splitting pain that made you do what you did. You stayed because he was good at hurting, knew the way your mind bent and how to push it. You stayed because you can remember the way he smiled at you when your eyes opened in the morning and he asked if you wanted coffee.

    "text": "After 13 years, I'm finally recovering from bulimia, but I didn't expect to feel this angry. *(Trigger warning for discussion of eating disorders, and maybe body dysmorphia, weight, and suicide, too.)*\n\nDon't get me wrong - I'm fucking thrilled that I've not only stopped bingeing & purging, but I've also made progress against the disordered thinking - something I've never been able to achieve before. The better I get, the more horrified I become as I look back and see the extent to which bulimia controlled and destroyed my life. It cost me jobs, one career and damn near another, my stomach, esophagus, and back teeth are wrecked, my boobs have lost their elasticity from constant weight fluctuation, and I'm starting to doubt I'll ever be comfortable with full-length mirrors. It fucking ruined my life. It's a hell and a prison I'd never wish on my worst enemy. \n\nBecause of how dark the past 13 years have been for me, recovery feels **amazing**. As I put more and more distance between the new me and active bulimic behavior, I've been able to gain some insight into how and why this happened to me, and that's where the rage comes in. \n\nObviously I'm a terrible judge, but objectively I'm a plain Jane. I'm honestly fine with that. I decided sometime in junior high that I wasn't interested in being pretty - I didn't relate to the cheerleaders and the popular girls. I decided that I was going to be smart instead. So what if I couldn't rely on my looks? I place infinitely higher value on intelligence, empathy, and curiosity. I was a nerd all through junior high and high school and was entirely comfortable with that. Fast forward a dozen years, a shitty marriage, and an even shittier divorce, and there I am - drunkenly scarfing down a can of ravioli and a bag of Cheezits, then bending over the toilet straining to throw it all up because of a sudden fear of gaining weight. I had been heavier while married, and the stress of the divorce had caused me to drop some weight. I was newly single and getting complimented, so I started to associate my personal value with my appearance for the first time. I was 30 years old. After I purged, I remember laying back down, staring up at the ceiling, and wondering why in the hell I had just done that. Weren't eating disorders for teenagers?\n\nI spent a couple of years starving myself before the bulimia really took over. I used to go on pro-anorexia message boards to talk with other people who understood what I was going through. We all looked at pictures of celebrities and super models as \"thinspiration,\" reminders not to eat because \"nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.\" (Incidentally, realizing how incredibly fucked up that scenario was got me interested in feminism, which is one of the gifts bulimia gave me.) **I had fallen right into the trap that I never gave a shit about.** I had internalized the bullshit, unrealistic, unhealthy idea of female \"beauty\" that is propagated everywhere in the media, and I spent 13 years punishing myself in extreme ways because I came to believe that if I wasn't thin and \"beautiful,\" I was nothing.\n\nNow when I think about it, I'm filled with white-hot rage at the constant objectification of women, particularly women's bodies. If I hadn't spent my entire life surrounded by all the terrible misogynistic messaging in media, maybe I wouldn't have had to go through the pain and suffering and cutting and hospitalizations and suicide attempts. Maybe I would have continued to focus on my personality, interests, opinions, and intellect as better indicators of my worth. Maybe I wouldn't have had to go through this process of recovery, which has been pretty painful in its own right.\n\nI'm remarried to a wonderful, amazing man who became interested in feminism after we terminated an unexpected pregnancy. (We're staunchly child free because the world is a shit hole and I'm not forcing anyone to live in it if I don't have to.) Complaining about the way women are portrayed in media is practically a feminist trope now, but fuck - the problems that shit creates are *real.* Real women suffer the consequences of those insane expectations all the time, all over the world, and for no other reason than to please and manipulate men. I don't exist to please a man. My body doesn't exist for a man's pleasure. I'm under no obligation to torture myself into looking like Kate Moss - particularly when I hear men tell jokes like \"Show me a guy dating a super model and I'll show you a guy who's tired of fucking her.\" \n\nI quit watching TV entirely, and it's actually improved my self esteem to a noticeable degree. I fucking hate that there are millions of young girls out there suffering the same awful bullshit I went through because they're constantly told that they aren't enough - not pretty enough, thin enough, sexy enough - while simultaneously being led to believe that the very qualities they lack are the only thing that men care about in a woman. In some ways it's a prison of our own making, because we enforce and reinforce these damaging standards with other women. I developed an eating disorder at 30, when I arguably should have known better, but teenagers, who are going through the most self conscious, awkward period of their lives, *don't* know any better. I'm fucking enraged for those girls. They deserve so much better than what they're being given, and I feel helpless to change anything about a notion so deeply embedded in our culture. Thanks for letting me vent. I hope you are all safe and healthy out there. Cheers :)",

    "text": "My dad has decided that it's more important for him to chase tail than to help my brother succeed. This really doesn't fit into this sub but it does deal with very toxic masculinity. It's mostly to rant.\n\nMy stepmother died from terminal liver cancer last Thanksgiving. She didn't deserve to die in that way but she was an extremely selfish and entitled individual. She believed my father's lies about my mother and hated her so much. \n\nWhen their son [my half-brother] started to start talking, he was definitely developing a speech impediment. And what did my father and stepmother do? Nothing. They were urged and advised to go to speech therapy but refused. My grandparents attempted to intervene and they were ignored and told to back off. Instead, my father chickenshitted because he can't handle confrontation and my stepmother used his \"disability\" as a way to get attention. \n\nAt 7, he was put into Montessori school with his cousins on the stepmom's side because it was \"convenient\" for both my father and stepmom as both of them didn't really want to compromise their work schedules for their son. Pretty much, he did nothing... from ages 7 to 12.\n\nSo, now that my father is now a single parent, he hasn't really tried at all to help my brother... during the at home learning, my dad would call me and my sisters up to pretty much do my brother's homework. My bother couldn't read any of his assignments. \n\nAt one point, my older sister tutored him and you could tell that he wasn't \"disabled\" or \"slow\"... just no one taught him how to do anything. She was getting some success until she had to take 2 weeks off to recover from back surgery and when she got back, my brother blew her off, saying that she was talking down to him and was mean. \n\nAnd since then, my dad has not attempted to get him another tutor. Instead, he just put him back in public school and expects them to deal with it because he just doesn't see it as his problem. He constantly blames the Montessori school system but at the end of the day, it is 100% his and my stepmom'a fault. \n\nRecently I had called my dad since he left me a voicemail wishing me Happy Birthday and that him and my brother were sick. Speaking them him, he says that my brother was the one who was sick with Covid [they are anti-vaxxers and Trumpsters 🙄], so my brother was going to be missing the first 2 weeks of school. \n\nDuring this phone call, though, dad told me that he was going to start dating again.... I can't tell how much this pissed me off. And I told him, \"No, you need to focus on my brother.\" His excuses were that he couldn't rearrange his schedule for work, he can't really focus on my brother right now, he doesn't have the energy to handle \"his problem,\" he's no good in handle things like this.... IE, my dad is fucking lazy and doesn't want to figure out how to help my brother. So, instead, he's dating to find and manipulate someone who will help him with his problem. \n\nMy dad has done this before, sadly. When my mom and dad split up and me and my younger sister lived with my dad, he had manipulated this sweet lady from Alabama to pack up and move to Utah, promising her that he would marry her. My dad had no intention of ever marrying her, he intended to use her to take care of me and my younger sister. And when I left to go live with my mom [it became apparent that I would not be safe to live with my dad because he thought I was annoying and would bust my lips open or throw me against the wall], my younger sister had to deal with the revolving door of women coming to the house and she was expected to take care of herself. She had to find ways to get to school and make her dinners. Dad would even try to not support her by getting her the things she needed like pads and hair products. When she came to finally live with me, older sister and mom, she had rats in her hair because dad had restricted the amount of conditioner she could use [and she had a ton of super thick blonde hair]. This was because he wanted to use him money on others things and not on his children.\n\nBack to the phone call... My dad is 57.... he's telling me that he has been chatting up a 32 year old from Chicago, who is model-fit, ivy-league university graduate who is loaded [I hope to fucking Cthulu that he is being catfished because he deserves it] and she is suppose to be coming to visit him... in two weeks. Also.... I'm 32 and I am only slightly grossed out by this. I've played with 52-55 year old men myself, they were very well to do and stable... but my dad is poor white trash, bad bucked teeth, beer gut, redneck, bigot, racist, Trumpster, sexist [Jack]Mormon man... as I already know from the Tinder sub, he is fucking lying to this woman about so much and that also makes me fucking angry.\n\nIn the end, my brother this entire time was made to believe that he was disabled. He's been fed that lie and spoiled and have had everything done for him because he's \"disabled.\" He doesn't know how to read, write, do basic arithmetic or properly talk. He's 5'8 and weighs over 300. He's too scared to talk because he doesn't want to be judged for how he speaks [he still sounds like he's 7].\n\nIt's a really shitty situation and there's nothing I or my sisters can do because I am not in a situation myself that could accommodate my brother's situation. He needs a one-on-one learning situations, he needs to go to speech therapy, he needs to be put on a specialized program so that he can \"maybe\" graduate... which is still unlikely but he needs help and my dad has decided that his dick needed to be wetted first.\n\n#RAGE",

    "text": "My wife’s friend sent this email to her and their friends to help start a conversation about abortion Let’s talk about abortion. Everyone else is. \nThe lawmakers who made it clear women are a commodity they don’t give a flying fuck about—they have shit to say. The women who live in fear that people with more power than brains get to govern our bodies—well, we’re talking too. \n\nBut the group I’d like to hear from—loudly—are the women who’ve actually fucking been through it. The women on ice cold operating tables in thin paper gowns. The women in depressing, chaotic Planned Parenthood waiting rooms. The women who made the undesirable, unpopular—and in some places—illegal choice. Until we hear more from that key demographic, we’re not getting anywhere very fast. It’s becoming clear that significant change happens faster when people speak up and point a spotlight at something that’s been hidden and taboo for too long: about their sexual assaults, about their diverse sexualities, about their wage discrepancies. About their abortions. \n\nI’ll start. \n\nI had two abortions, in two different Aprils, 10 years apart. The first time I got pregnant by a rich white man who had no desire to commit to me and treated me like trash. The second time I got pregnant by a rich white man who had no desire to commit to me and treated me like trash. I loved both of these men. Our respective babies would have been highly intelligent, creative, arguably attractive and, apparently, rich. Except in both cases, I would have been raising the child completely alone. \n\nTo raise my child alone in April of 2005: I would have dropped out of the grad school program I was working two jobs just to be in, the very same program where I met rich guy #1—a guy who slept through most of his classes, dropped out of coveted internships at famous advertising agencies with no notice, and did a lot of designer drugs with daddy’s bottomless money. I would have given up on a career I was turning out to be pretty fucking good at and moved back to my small, conservative town so my parents could help me sort this mess out. I was so young, scared and desperately in love with this guy that A) I was terrified to tell him I wasn’t on birth control when he came inside me without asking the first time we had sex—and once was all it took. Then B) I waited to tell him about either the pregnancy or the abortion until I thought we were becoming more serious. He found out when the other girl he was sleeping with caught wind of it and thought it would be funny to shame me by telling everyone about something sad and scary I had been through all alone. So hilarious, right? I guess you had to be there. \n\nTo raise my child alone in April of 2015: I would have sacrificed the career I’d scraped and fought to build over the course of a decade, spent $50K in student loans on, and weathered an abortion and a recession for. I’d just moved home from working in a fashionable European city and was settling back into the fashionable American city where I’d started my career. I had a whole damn life waiting back there for me. I was lucky enough to be making a healthy six-figure salary, I had a huge, supportive group of women friends, and, stupidly, I had a furtive sexual and emotional relationship with a close guy friend of many years whom I loved deeply. It might not have been so stupid if he was capable of loving me back. He wouldn’t even pick up the check for dinner the night I told him about the pregnancy and upcoming abortion appointment. We split it. A beautiful metaphor that pisses me off to this day. \n\nWow Lauren, you’re so irresponsible that you had not one but TWO abortions?, is what some people might be thinking. Sometimes what you might call irresponsibility is just shitty fucking luck. After abortion #1, I  found a birth control that worked for me for nearly 8 years, and I took it diligently, swallowing that pill first thing every morning. It was a tiny, daily prayer for control over my own future. Then I moved to Europe and spent the next 2 years bleeding out while trying every French birth control on the market. I was in a committed relationship with an amazing man who was sick of having our sex life sabotaged by these tiny little pills. He begged me to go off birth control and we used condoms religiously from then on. If the condom broke, we marched his French ass and my American ass across the street to the pharmacy for a 12€ morning after pill. Then quelle dommage, we broke up, I moved back to America, and two days later fell backwards into bed with my old friend, rich guy #2. Condoms didn’t suit his lifestyle and the pill that had once worked like a charm for 8 years suddenly turned on me. More bleeding. Suicidal thoughts. Unsustainable. Cue abortion #2. \n\nFor years, I was the only one I knew who’d had an abortion. The silence around the topic was deafening. Occasionally, for fun, I asked friends if they knew anyone who’d had an abortion and they said no. But they did, whether they knew it or not, because they knew me. I had a drunken conversation with my dad over Christmas 2005, wherein I confessed and, in solidarity, he admitted he’d gotten his teenage girlfriend pregnant in the dusty little town where I grew up. There, in the shadow of Texas itself, churches were many, and abortion clinics were few-to-none. Aside from this shocking and illuminating, less-than-festive holiday chat, I felt very alone. And though I was deeply at peace with my decisions—correction: deeply proud of the way I’d stood up for my own fucking future and my own fucking body—there was a shame that comes as a byproduct of feeling very alone. \n\nThen one day, almost offhandedly, the women in my life began to talk to me about their abortions. A colleague abroad. My creative partner at a different big-name agency. A college professor who’s a mentor to me. A boss who’s like a mother to me. A few people I barely fucking knew.\n\nTurns out, I have many friends who have terminated pregnancies. I have friends who have terminated pregnancies for health reasons. I have friends who have terminated pregnancies for timing reasons. For money reasons. For personal reasons that weren’t expressly communicated to me because it wasn’t my goddamn business. I have friends who have terminated pregnancies, then gone on to start a family when both the father and the timing were right. I have friends in loving, healthy partnerships who got pregnant and decided it wasn’t the right thing for them. I have friends who’ve terminated pregnancies that I don’t even know about. And so do you. And while a sum total of zero people owe me information about the hard shit they’ve been through, I do think that every single woman who speaks up gets us closer to the total autonomy of our bodies that every single one of us deserves. \n\nIf we don’t start normalizing this shit, the government will continue to preach their agenda-driven gospel that we are unfit to make decisions about our own bodies. And if we don’t step up and talk about it, we’ll never normalize it. Yes—it’s an incredibly private thing, and it’s an incredibly polarizing thing. And, yes, even a friend who is firmly pro-choice and marches for productive rights and is all up in Instagram with her self righteousness might lowkey judge you when she finds out you’ve actually had an abortion. Maybe some of you friends are judging me even now. That’s usually a reaction borne of society’s pervasive culture of judgment around this topic and that’s completely up to you. That’s the reaction the Texas lawmakers are hoping for, because it keeps everyone silent. But abortion saves lives. It saved mine twice. It gave me the right to live my life, the one I built with my own brain and my own money, as I saw fit—not a life based on a biological misfire by some rich asshole who decided a condom was just not fucking worth it in the long run. \n\nIs it fair that we have to rage and fight in order to be granted the baseline, the bare fucking minimum, of rights for our own bodies? Fuck no. The raging and fighting for civil rights wasn’t fair. The raging and fighting for gay rights wasn’t fair. This is a fucked up world. Still want to bring a child into it? If you do, it's 100% your right and it's 0% of my business.\n\nI love the babies of my friends, and the babies born into my family. I do not, however, want babies of my own. An occasionally unpopular opinion, to be sure. Between rings of birth control, boxes of condoms and two terminations, I’ve spent a LOT of money ensuring that I don’t have any. Sometimes it feels like fighting a losing battle, this trying not to have unwanted children—ask any woman who has tried not one but many different kinds of what turned out to be the wrong birth control and bled for months without stopping (ask me). Ask any woman who has had an IUD go rogue and permanently damage the inside of her body (ask my cousin). Ask any woman whose health insurance refused to cover the exorbitant cost of the aforementioned unreliable methods (ask my friends). Ask any woman for whom added hormones in her bloodstream caused depression, anger, hopelessness, and a feeling of being alien in her own body (ask the next woman you see). Ask any woman who’s had a man argue in defense of skipping the condom for just a little less hassle and a little more pleasure (ask every fucking woman I know). \n\nI have my reasons for not wanting babies. Some of them selfish? Yes, absolutely. I live in the shiny city they base all the movies on and I work hard and make a fuckload of money and I want to spend every single dime of it on myself. Or sometimes I want to spend it being a generous friend, daughter and sister. However, some of my reasons for not wanting babies are things like the planet we’ve trashed, the horrifying rising floodwaters of climate change, the footage of bloody school shootings and the untold horrors just over the horizon we can’t even see coming yet. COVID-19 being a casual example I’ll just toss out. In which case, not wanting to bring a child into a dangerous and dying world can feel like exactly the right move. Whether you have babies or you want babies or you’re quite not sure yet, it’s your fucking business. Full stop. \n\nAbortion is a fucking act of bravery. It’s taking 100% of the physical responsibility for something you were only 50% responsible for. Which is, by the way, what it is to be a woman who’s pregnant, in general—whether she carries the child to term or not. 100% of the physical responsibility for something you were only 50% responsible for. Biology is incredibly light in the logic department. \n\nI refuse to be held hostage by biology. I refuse to let the government or the church tell me they have a plan for my one precious life that’s bigger or smarter than my own. I refuse to stay silent any longer about this thing I did, twice, because it’s my body and my fucking right. I’m angry at the stigma and I’m sick of feeling like the government owns my body and lets me rent it out by the month. My kids would have been amazing and I don’t fucking miss them for a second. Abortion is family planning. Abortion is health care. Abortion is way more common than you think. Every woman has a story—whether it’s the time she was scared shitless she was pregnant and absolutely needed abortion to be an option, whether she was actually pregnant and went through with an abortion, or whether she knew someone else who did. Every woman has some kind of story. Now is a really good time to start telling yours.",

With COVID on top of that, this is easily the hardest time in my life. My Mom has a new boyfriend and this is my first time meeting him. Last night he tells me about his life and how much he's loved my Mom ever since they were teenagers. \nIn explaining all this, he was trying to be the \"cool mom's boyfriend\" and relate to me or whatever, and he said \"I didn't have much money as a kid, my parents were abusive, and I spent a lot of time at my friends' houses.\" All this is fine and it's nice knowing that someone else actually knows what hardship looks like, but then he goes and says \"compared to [him], [I] have it pretty good.\"\n\nMy Mom has always taught me never to compare myself to others and that it's \"an exercise in futility.\" The fact that her boyfriend has the audacity to judge my life and deem it easier than his makes me sick. I do not know what it is like to be him, maybe he did have it harder, but I certainly am not arrogant enough to tell him he has it better than me. \n\nAfter saying that he knows everything about me, he then just spouts life advice like how I need to reconnect with people in my past (my family disowned me last week and my high school friends told me to go kill myself when I came out. What people from my past are you referring to specifically? Cause I'm pretty sure there's not many people from my past left to reconnect with) and about how I NEED to do X and NEED to do Y. All in all between his arrogance and his advice, it showed that he clearly didn't understand my situation at all, and why would he given that all he knows about me is through my Mom? Who is really stupid enough to think they know everything about someone just because you've talked to a relative of theirs?\n\nI called up my (gay) uncle afterwards because I was so furious and my uncle laughed and said \"so what you're telling me is that a straight guy did exactly what every straight guy does. Why exactly are you surprised?\" And he's 100% right. Why did I expect anything different? My Mom told me about how great he is and I'm happy that she's happy but why was I stupid enough to expect him to be anything better than the average guy. \n\nWhat is it about straight cis white (christian, abled, etc.) men where they think that they have all the answers, they know everything, that they're smarter than you and can solve your problems better than you can?",

    "text": "Opinions On Ethnic Women Having Blonde Hair So, here's the situation. I recently dyed my hair blonde, and it took a lot for me to muster up the courage to not care about having blonde hair as an Asian-American. Of course, you see a bunch of Asian American women with a blonde balayage, and they look amazing with it. I have had light brown hair for over a year, and I just really felt inclined to switch it up late last year because I needed a fresh new start (things ended badly with the guy I was dating). I thought going blonde would help me feel more confident, but instead it makes me feel so weird about myself in public (especially when I am hanging out with my white friends). I have this perception that people think I am trying to be something I am not (\"act white\") and that as an Asian American, I should stick to the darker hair colors. I know that so many non-white women can rock the blonde hair (I was inspired by yanyanchan on IG) and that wanting to be blonde does not stem from a desire to look Caucasian. The blonde color is just pretty (especially when you wear so much black clothing) and can spice up your hair.\n\nI was just wondering what everyone's views are on this. Have any of you guys regretted going blonde or felt weird about being a blonde when you aren't white? I spent hundreds of dollars to go blonde, and now that I am, I feel like I should just go back to the salon and dye it brown/black again. I hate that I feel like this, but I've spent way too much time thinking about my hair. Even though my hair looks great and that I still think I look pretty, I just feel weirdly judged when I see people look at me in public.",

Each patient had at least 12 morning meds and then throughout the owhole day. Only one went down for a test for about 30 mins so they were on the floor the whole time. Trach patients, a couple NG tubes, wound vac, craniotomy, heavy on the call bell complaining for banal things, you name it. I also had a student until 5 PM and I’ve only been on the floor for 3 months. I got a couple discharge orders in (one for a patient who we had to code but they ended up not following through with it).  Only one was discharged and the ambulance service didn’t come until 6:45 PM. After I discharged this patient, I went to give report on the patient who we ended up coding. At that moment, I’d realized I forgot to give the 6 PM PO Keppra. I turned white and then ran in and she was just staring off into the abyss. Mind you, she had full conversations with me all day about what she’d due when she got home. She was in bad shape though. Mets to the brain. Me and the ongoing nurse immediately did what you do in that situation. Pulses were fine but flaccid extremities and dilated pupils. She looked like someone from a horror movie who was possessed by a demon or something. So we called STAT team as they were close by as well as a code stroke. The patient appeared to have a stroke and a seizure as I went with them to take her to STAT CT and speak to the tele-neurologist as it was 7:10 PM at this point. During the period of starting to leave patient’s room, IDK what came over me but I kinda broke down. I felt the guilt of missing her 6 PM med and started just tearing up. I felt awful. This had never happened before. It’s no excuse but I was swamped all day and out of all the meds, this happened to be the only one I missed. Still, I felt awful. My charge told me that since it was a PO Keppra, if this was going to happen, it likely would’ve anyway but still, I felt like the worse nurse in the world. I just needed to vent because I felt like a failure and could feel a nurse or two judging me for that. A couple nurses were super supportive but I still just felt like a huge dumbass and wanted to crawl into a hole. Thanks for reading and letting me get that off of my chest. I’m not into today so IDK how she’s doing as well.  I’m thankful to the nurses that really helped and got me through it. All in all, it wasn’t a horrible experience but as a relatively new RN, it was a lot out of nowhere.",

    "text": "My multicultural teaching class hates disabled folk. I’m disabled. I know what I mean. I’m not exaggerating.\n\nWe had to take some tests where we judge our internal prejudice based on a test that relies completely on the ability to see and use your hands perfectly. My results were all over the place cause my eyes unfocused due to how the images were placed and I have dyscalculia among other things. I was somehow racist and ableist. Shocking since I’m not white and in a wheelchair.\n\nI made a student discussion post after reading some other responses about how can this test be fair/it’s ironic/it’s flaws. I made a very sharp point to be open, communicative, and kind. I was so sure my classmates would agree. That they see how ABLEIST this MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION CLASS has gotten.\n\nThen I read the rest of the posts. One of them literally said “My results showed I have a very strong preference for abled people over disableds. This doesn’t mean I dislike disableds. But I do prefer abled people over them”. This woman is studying to be a teacher.\n\nAnother dude went on a rant about how he’s been hurt but bucked it up so yea he does dislike SOME disabled people cause hes never made an excuse for himself (he was military he literally had no choice but go off) so 22 year olds with handicap placards piss him off. He also said that he doesn’t really care cause he’s too old to change his mind.\n\nAnd of course there was a SE teacher who admitted she also disliked disabled folk. And she saw no issue with that. Just… wow. Wow.\n\nI once again wrote a long, respectful message as someone who is ACTUALLY REALLY DISABLED. For him at least. For her I just basically said “hello how is this possible”. For the SE teacher I just closed my laptop cause I got so mad I wanted to cry.\n\nI thought that’d be the end of it but there were so many who seemingly took the disability prejudice quiz to just… show off how much they hate my kind?\n\nWhen it came to incorrect test results due to how the test is designed with neurologically and physically perfect folk in mind, the only ones who complained were the ones who took the gender and race tests. Other than one who got wrong on the disabled test. ONE. Out of a class of 36 where about half did they disability test.\n\nI had my suspicions before due to the fact that the course is a few weeks close to done and a flawed quiz is the most we’ve talked about disability but this throws it.\n\nI know good and well how hurtful the world is to disabled folk. I just expected better HERE.\n\nI don’t know where to go or what to do. I’m honestly afraid of the responses I’m gonna get now that I see the whole truth. Is the whole profession this ableist?",

    "text": "Rethinking a Law-Degree / Job? I'm OGMeowmix and I was hoping you could help me with a dilemma I'm having. So a bit of background , I am a second year college student, 23 (took time off school to help family), and a straight white male, living in the midwest. I currently hold a GPA that exceeds a 4.0. I transferred to my state school program after going to a private art college for a 3 years when I wanted to be a painter. I'm currently working on a degree that is going towards pre-law, history, or Poli-Sci, and doing quite well in it. \n\nOn to the question at hand, I am currently trying to get into a decent if not prestigious school to get a bachelors, and then a law degree with a focus in Social Justice / Human Rights. The reason I'm doing this is because I always feel hollow, but the one thing that stirs my soul is when I look at the turmoil revolving around Racism, and Police Brutality in our country. It is the only time I have cried in multiple years, every-time I hear about someone dying I just think about if someone could have changed the system and saved them. However, I know next to nothing about working in a law field, I just know my heart longs for justice and equal rights for everyone, and that with my potential, and my intellect I could be a force of change. But I'm having a dilemma. I have always been poor, my family is well off enough but some are poor just like me. I don't plan on having any kids, maybe I'll get married, but I want my life to focus on my work. I want to make enough money to just have a dog, a decent apartment, and be able to eat and pay my bills, and then after that, give it back to my family and to people who *really* need it. \nIs there ever really an escape from this cycle of poverty? Is aiming for a law degree at 23 too late? I know that I want to pursue a higher education so that I can get my family out of this cycle of poverty. I'm not afraid of hard work or long nights,I definitely have grit and I'm intelligent, but I just need to get a reliable game plan together soon. I'm just scared of realizing my choices are not feasible like I did with painting.\n\nI am also open to career suggestions, I have taken most of the major career assessment surveys, and I'm an Investigative, Creative, and Social person. some of the suggested careers for me across all of the tests are \n\n\\- Psychiatrist \n\n\\- Forensic, Clinical, Counseling, and Neuro Psychologist \n\n\\- Historian\n\n\\- Professor\n\n\\- Graphic Designer\n\n\\- Judge\n\n\\- Archaeologist \n\n\\- Lawyer \n\n\\- Forensic pathologist \n\n\\- Intelligence Analyst  \n\nI would really appreciate any advice you lovely people could give. If anyone could provide their own experiences with the careers above It would be appreciated.",

    "text": "I want a summer job that's fulfilling and decent-paying? Are there jobs like that for me? So, first, I'm not a student. I just have a job where things die down a lot in the summer, and I'm in a place where I could do a little work in the summer. I kinda like having something on the side. I'd like to do something that does some good in the world, even if in a convoluted way, but it needs to pay enough that I don't feel like walking away when the job has its inevitable tough moments.\n\nI should say, there are so many interesting internships out there, but they're reserved for students. I really wish some might be open to random 35 yo guys. \n\nIn terms of qualifications, I have a law degree, a PhD in the humanities. I haven't practiced law much, and I'm not sure I'd want to, especially since I only have the summer. I've done some consulting work for state government on crime and punishment issues, since that's related to my main work. I've done teaching related to my areas of expertise at every level from middle school to postgraduate. I've served on nonprofit boards for performing arts stuff as well as legal stuff. I've done fundraising, but I'm not interested in doing that again, at least not as a significant part of my day.\n\nI had an offer for a perfect thing back in 2020. The job was introducing high school kids to the American legal system over 6 weeks. It was some classroom instruction stuff plus taking lots of field trips to meet local judges, civil servants, and politicians. It paid 2k per week. Then COVID happened, and it was cancelled for the summer, and then this year, I learned that the entire program was cancelled.\n\nI've really like the consulting work, but it's just too irregular. Someone asked me to blog 2x per week about national crime and punishment stories for 3k for the entire year. That's just not worth my time. Someone suggested that I run a particular summer camp for kids, and that sounds like fun but also challenging. The camp would pay $1k per week, but that might not be enough reward for the headaches.\n\nAnyway, I'm looking for suggestions. I've mostly mentioned white collar stuff in the legal or education sectors, but I'm not above doing other stuff. Years ago, for a few months, my spouse and I rented two apartments, and I did Airbnb for the smaller one. This was just great. I honestly enjoyed getting the place ready for new guests. I would consider Uber if I were a better driver and not overly concerned about wear and tear to my car. \n\nI'm open in terms of area. I'd like to stay in the US, especially East Coast or Midwest, but I'm genuinely open.\n\nAnyway, any help you can offer would be appreciated. And if there's anything I can clarify, I'm happy to do so. I don't really wanna talk about my current job, but just assume that there are no conflicts, no restrictions on what I can do, and I have perfect job security. It's completely remote in summer, and the workload is usually less than 1 hour per week. (I did get slammed with 80 hours one week this past summer, but they did ask if I had the bandwidth before giving it to me. I could've said no.)",

    "text": "Is this a valid reason to fire an employee? It took me a couple days to gather my thoughts and be able to look for some answers. And now, after getting tired of walking every nook and crannies of my house thinking of what I did wrong I decided to post here hoping that some veterans from the industry would leave a comment.\n\nI'm an electrical engineer and I had been working in embedded systems field (for about 6 years), doing embedded software for 80% of my time. I got a new job in September, as an embedded software engineer, joined a team of 3 seniors and 2 juniors.The first two weeks I had some self-training, where I had to read some documents, manuals and ask questions whenever I did not understand something. The next 5-6 weeks we had a team training for all the new members (me and the 2 new employees) and it was like university classes, it was online due to the pandemic and we would look at some presentations about how the industry works and some other things the company and our team would need to do.During those presentations-meetings we were asked questions (the new guys) like \"we would like each one of you to tell us what he thinks that one means, or how would we solve that problem\" etc. At the end of those weeks we gave \"exams\". We had a test-task like a \"real task simulation\" so the rest of the team (3 seniors) would see how we work and think. That took about 4-5 days and at the end we looked into it all together. That wasn't actually code it was a UML generated code and we would draw UML shapes and charts. It was the first time  we used the company's uml generator software which was still in the development phase too. I made some minor mistakes in the use of software some things should have be done differently and also some mistakes other more important mistakes like missing some things in the uml. my team who judged the results told me to be more careful about my work (1st warning). I apologized, admitted my mistakes and tried to get better.Later, meetings ended, I didn't know what the other new guys were doing at the moment and I was given some tasks. I had one big task that took about 1.5 months, broken down in smaller tasks of course. I ported about 15 projects from makefile to cmake. None of us knew cmake. We looked at it together at the beginning and I was just doing some experiments to help the team decide which way we should follow. I had my second warning when I pushed commits for reviews that had some copy-paste errors in cmake. like you take the cmakelist from one project and you start building the next one and I forgot to remove or rename a few variables etc. or I didn't see that some makefiles had some extra functions that I forgot to add etc...My third and last warning was when they asked me to setup an open-source program in my computer and install an add-on on it (from a public github repo on the internet). They asked me to set it up, create a test (draft) project and send it to them to see if it works ok, so they can be sure that the program works fine in my computer and they can send me tasks in the future. The add-on didn't work and my manager got angry because I didn't take the task seriously as I didn't put effort to make it work. I asked for help and they told me they were busy and we would look at it together some other time. I spent a few hours on the weekend trying to figure out what went wrong. I found out that the latest commit of this \"add-on\" had a bug. Checked out the previous commit and everything worked fine (I was doing the checks between my computers at home). I spoke to my manager about all this and let them know. the reply was \"ok it works now\" but I think it was already late and they had decided to fire me. So a month later they fired me. They called me in the office and that very moment they asked me to leave. They told me I'm not a good fit for the team and I should better look for something else. The rest conversation didn't matter and 30 minutes later, just before lunch, I was driving home.\n\nI think that's a good picture of the whole situation, please feel free to judge, I don't like white lies. I wanna get better  as a person and at my job because I love it.\n\nI have a few questions more about the incident.\n\nShould I mention all that in my future interviews?\n\nIs it going to affect my future career?\n\nShould I put those 4 months I was working there in my resume?\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the award guys!!! That's awesome!! And thank you all for your time to answer !!!",

    "text": "**Hoping for better grades in the Spring?** Here's a comprehensive guide on how to study and do well in law school, while staying sane, from a successful T14 3L **Hello 1Ls!** Now that Fall grades are released and the Spring semester is almost upon us, some of you are inevitably disappointed by the results. That's OK! You can turn things around in the Spring, but only if you take some time to reflect on what went right and what went wrong so that you can improve your strategies. To help with that process, I wanted to repost the 1L guide that I shared here a few months ago. The way Reddit works, many of you probably never saw it, and still others may have forgot. It's the exact same advice I've given my 1L mentees over the past two years, who report that it was super helpful in allowing them to beat the curve. In particular, the \"productivity\" section at the end might be helpful in analyzing what you did last time.\n\n\nAs always, feedback from other 2/3Ls and grads is encouraged!\n\n\n**Original post:**\n\nHi friends! 3L at UVA here. I recently put together these notes as part of some advice I was giving to our incoming 1Ls. Given the explosion of \"holy crap I'm a 1L and am totally overwhelmed, help!\" posts floating around the sub, I figured it might be helpful to share these tips with the rest of you. They should apply to any school, but check with your professors and/or older students if you're not sure. If you're reading this later in the semester, you can also check out advice I posted last year for the [last month before finals](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/dtiy6y/detailed_game_plan_for_finals_for_all_the_anxious/) and advice for [taking the final exam itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/e7m4uz/for_1ls_a_detailed_guide_on_how_the_hell_you/). For the sake of establishing credibility, yes, I did very well in law school based on the approach outlined below. I've also received a ton of excellent advice from older students, my classmates, and the internet, which has been incorporated into my personal strategy over time. If you want further reading, [this excellent collection of resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/hum9n5/aggregated_content_for_rising_1ls_and_others/) by moderator [/u/Hstrat](https://www.reddit.com/u/Hstrat/) is a great place to go next and includes sources that influenced my tips below.\n\nHappy to turn this into a psuedo-AMA if you have questions!\n\n**Fellow 2/3Ls & grads** \\- I welcome any comments, criticism, or additional suggestions you want to add!\n\n**Caveats/Intro**\n\n* No advice is “correct” (including this), just suggestions to try for yourself\n* No one will ever see your notes/outlines/flashcards/etc, only the exam itself\n* The exam is 100% of your grade, so focus on that\n\n   * Your entire semester should work backwards from the exam\n   * Obviously if your syllabus says otherwise, adjust accordingly\n\n**Sleep/health/caffeine/drinking**\n\n* Your physical and mental health are important for obvious human reasons  \n\n   * They are ALSO critically important for grades\n* 1L is a marathon, not a sprint\n* You WILL burnout eventually  \n\n   * The question is when, how bad, and how fast can you bounce back?\n   * Delaying burnout and mitigating its intensity is key; health is critical to this\n* The increased brainpower, efficiency, and speed of being healthy, well-rested, and mentally/emotionally centered vastly outpaces any time “lost” from not studying more\n* Specifically: Sleep, exercise, diet, relaxation, reasonable levels of caffeine/alcohol/drugs  \n\n   * Sleep is absolute king here\n   * An hour of sleep is more valuable than an hour of anything else, including studying, job applications, exercise, socializing, etc. because it makes all of those activities way better/easier during the rest of the day\n\n**General life/social stuff**\n\n* Warn your family, friends, partner, etc. that law school is really intense and that 1L Fall is by far the most important semester  \n\n   * It will NOT be that bad, but it’s wise to set their expectations low and have them be pleasantly surprised that you’re available, rather than be mad that you’re not available enough\n   * They should be under the impression that your life will be 100% taken up by studying, until you’re comfortable enough with your schedule to inform them otherwise\n* Be nice to everyone, don’t start drama  \n\n   * This is all so much easier when you get along\n   * Contribute to and take advantage of the support network!\n   * Remember that every classmate will also be lawyer, in a very small world, and it’s better to be friends with the hiring partner, opponent, client, attorney general, judge, whatever than to have them remember when you tried to fight them on the softball field lol\n\n**Pacing/high-level overview**\n\n* Common mistakes: burnout too early, or (less common) slack until the end  \n\n   * You CANNOT push yourself round the clock in the library all day every day all semester – literally nobody can keep up this pace forever  \n\n      * Every year people try this, burn themselves out, and get wrecked in finals\n   * You should assume that you are totally average until 1L grades tell you otherwise  \n\n      * If you’re insecure that you’re not smart enough, you’re probably wrong (chances are you’re average)\n      * If you’re overconfident because you think you’re smarter than everyone else, you’re also probably wrong (chances are you’re average too)\n* You need a plan, and it should be ambitious but reasonable  \n\n   * Plan for problems/interruptions/sickness/distraction\n   * Leave slack in your schedule each week, and across the semester as a whole\n* Each hour of your time becomes more valuable the closer you get to finals  \n\n   * Thus, try to front-load tasks as much as possible without burning out\n\n**Work backwards from the exam**\n\n* The exam is the only thing that matters\n* Repeat: **THE EXAM IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS**  \n\n   * Plan the entire semester based on this realization\n   * Cases are important for learning, but pretty unimportant for the exam  \n\n      * Repeat: they *ARE important*, just not while sitting in the exam\n* So start by figuring out: what does the exam look like?  \n\n   * **NOTE**: Check the format with your professor, on the off-chance that it’s different… but most will be like this:\n   * A series of hypotheticals that you will need to analyze, often w/ little guidance, and write about in a Word doc for the professor (at some schools this may be done via special exam software but the content is the same)\n   * Extreme time pressure\n   * (Usually) open-book, open-note, even open-internet\n   * Blind grading (professor has no idea who you are)  \n\n      * Notably, they also don't know whether you nailed a cold call or bombed it\n   * Cases are used only for their key takeaway/rule, and maybe to analogize the most important facts to the exam hypo  \n\n      * *At most* you might say something like “Necessity is not a defense to murder (*Dudley*), so in this case John wouldn’t be able to raise it.”\n      * Or something like, “The workers here are independent contractors, but unlike the anesthesiologists in *Roessler*, they don’t seem to have apparent authority.”\n      * This kind of unofficial “citation” to a case is not only the maximum you’d have to do, it’s honestly more than most professors would expect or care about – you DO NOT have to even use cases to this degree\n      * The point is, a few days/weeks from now, when you’re spending so much time learning cases, reflect back on these examples in this post, and realize how little information you’ll actually use from them on the exam\n* So, now that you know what the exam involves, what sorts of tools would probably help you during the exam?  \n\n   * A gigantic, well-organized document with all the information from the class, that you can CTRL-F to find things  \n\n      * This is an “outline”\n   * Your raw class notes to CTRL-F in case you missed something  \n\n      * This is why you should take good notes\n   * A shorter document laying out only the most important info as a reminder, that you can glance at quickly mid-exam  \n\n      * This is an “attack outline”\n   * Other visual aids?  \n\n      * An excel database of cases w/ key info?\n      * Flowcharts?\n      * Other creative ideas?\n   * Knowing your professor’s opinions, preferences, quirks\n   * Practice: having done a very similar exam multiple times before  \n\n      * AKA “practice exams”\n   * General familiarity with the content from constant exposure  \n\n      * AKA consistent studying and review all semester\n* What will probably NOT help you during the exam:  \n\n   * Memorization (because it’s open note)\n   * Flashcards\n   * Details of case facts\n   * Full case briefs\n   * In-depth reasoning of majority/dissent\n   * Historical cases that are no longer relevant\n   * Highlighting in your casebook\n   * Rambling about general legal concepts not directly related to hypo\n   * Policy/theory/ethics  \n\n      * UNLESS explicitly asked, or specific prof likes it\n   * The opinions, preferences, quirks of your classmates\n* Thus, **devote more time to developing things that will help and less time to things that won’t help**  \n\n   * Don’t spend time on things just because they feel like “work” (ex. writing out a 2-page analysis of each case you read, making flashcards), or because your classmates are doing it, or older students say to do it, or even because professors say to do it (it’s been probably decades since they were in school)  \n\n      * **This includes not blindly listening to ME either!** Think critically and carefully about each task and consider whether it will really help you come exam time\n      * Solicit suggestions from 2/3Ls, classmates, profs, the internet, and try out their methods…. But be prepared to adapt to your own way, or toss them out\n* I have way more to say about exam nitty-gritty and strategy, but that should wait until much later in the semester  \n\n   * When the time comes, check out my post about [preparing for exams during the final month of the semester](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/dtiy6y/detailed_game_plan_for_finals_for_all_the_anxious/), followed by my post detailing [specific strategies for writing the exam itself once you're sitting in it](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/e7m4uz/for_1ls_a_detailed_guide_on_how_the_hell_you/)\n\n**Taking notes in class**\n\n* By far the most important thing you can do\n* The professor is judge, jury, and executioner of your exam  \n\n   * If you, the book, or supplements ever disagree with the professor, the professor is always right (for the exam anyway)\n   * Many profs will encourage you to challenge their ideas, either in class or in office hours…. But when it comes to the exam, follow what they think\n   * If you get a policy/political question, you may choose to argue a point that your prof disagrees with, if it’s truly a debatable non-settled non-legal question  \n\n      * But when it comes to “how does Torts work” your prof is always correct\n* For most profs, 99.9% of the information you’ll need will come up in class at some point (either from the prof, or from discussion w/ students)  \n\n   * This is part of why devoting too much time to reading/briefing isn’t worth it – you’ll get the info in class\n* Pay attention, take lots of notes, fill any holes either by asking classmates, revisiting the recordings, or going to office hours\n* Take your notes for each subject in one big combined Word doc, NOT separate docs for each class period (ex. all Crim notes in a single doc, not \"Crim August 26th\" and \"Crim August 28th\")\n\n   * Trust me, this will save you enormous time and effort later\n   * You can also use more sophisticated tools like One Note if you know how\n* If you handwrite, you will HAVE to transfer them to electronic form at some point so you can use them for outlining and during the exam  \n\n   * Probably smart to set up a routine for doing this each week or other similar time period\n* Follow whatever style and format works best for your brain - nothing else matters\n\n**Reading**\n\n* Timing: probably good to get ahead, at least by a couple days  \n\n   * Aspire to finish the semester’s reading early if you can\n   * By reading ahead, you leave room for problems (if you get sick or have some deadline or are burned out, the punishment is being back on normal pace, rather than falling behind)\n   * BUT consider that being too far ahead means you forget details and can mess up cold calls  \n\n      * Probably good to do a quick refresh right before class\n   * Start to track how long it takes to read each page (this may be different for each class)  \n\n      * Not to be a gunner, but so that you can accurately estimate time for each assignment\n      * You *will* get faster as the semester goes on (often significantly faster) - this is part of the normal law school process\n* Read every word carefully the first time through\n* Try really hard to understand what’s going on factually and legally\n* Try to figure out how each judge is making their arguments\n* Practice distilling the key questions:  \n\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, what are the facts?\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, what legal rule comes out of this?\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, what did the dissent say (if any)?\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, is there any other context/info from book?\n   * Ex. *R v. Dudley & Stevens*  \n\n      * Facts: “Two guys starving on boat eat third guy”\n      * Law: “Rule: necessity is not a valid defense to murder”\n      * Context: “This is an old English case and American law is a bit different now”\n* Probably smart to write down those super brief, super important summaries in case you get cold called, though it’s not strictly necessary  \n\n   * However….\n\n**Briefing**\n\n* CONTROVERSIAL: should you write down *all* of those facts, details, arguments, and legal minutiae from the reading?  \n\n   * This is called “briefing”\n   * Doing this is part of traditional law school advice, but highly controversial\n   * There seems to be a modern trend away from briefing\n* Briefing pros:  \n\n   * Cold calls are way easier\n   * You never need to revisit the book because it’s all there\n   * Helps some people remember facts/arguments/details better\n   * May force you to understand things better\n* Briefing cons:  \n\n   * Takes an absolutely enormous amount of time\n   * Most of the information is unnecessary outside of cold calls\n   * Will never be used on an actual exam\n   * You can survive a cold call without it\n   * People often become too reliant on them as a crutch\n   * Seriously, an enormous f\\*cking amount of time\n* Some people swear by briefing, including some very successful students\n* But many, including me, think they’re a waste of time  \n\n   * The ratio of time required to value gained is insanely wasteful\n   * They mostly help cold calls… and cold calls have no impact on your grade\n   * Many people study tons of hours and burn out… yet get bad grades?  \n\n      * Too much time spent briefing is often the culprit\n      * Briefing *feels like* you’re being productive and *feels like* you’re “learning” and “being a good law student” and “accomplishing something”… but many people discover come exam time that **those efforts don’t translate into results**\n   * Easy to be too perfectionist or worry about things like formatting, that no one will ever see\n   * Try it, maybe it works for you, but be ready to abandon if necessary\n   * Only do it if  \n\n      * a) you have no other more valuable tasks to do and\n      * b) are totally well-rested, relaxed, and bored and need no rest time\n   * I would much rather spend an hour reading ahead, outlining, doing practice exams (late in the semester), doing career services tasks, taking care of personal errands, making flowcharts, revising my notes, reviewing my notes, etc. than I would an hour of briefing\n   * I would also much rather spend an hour sleeping, partying, watching Netflix, jogging, etc. than an hour briefing, because my energy will recharge and make be more productive at other more important tasks\n* MIDDLE GROUND: “Book Briefing”  \n\n   * Highlight important things\n   * Make notes in the margins\n   * Don’t actually write out a full brief\n   * Many people like this solution\n\n**Outlining**\n\n* Sounds scarier than it is  \n\n   * Literally just compile your notes into one big document, edit it a bit, and format so it’s easy to look stuff up/organize\n   * If you add something to the outline you don’t understand or remember, revisit your notes/book/friends/supplements/professor to figure it out  \n\n      * Eventually you’ll understand everything\n* Use old outlines!  \n\n   * Everyone agrees you shouldn’t just use an old outline straight up (and sometimes profs don’t allow it)\n   * But you don’t necessarily need to take the time to build one from scratch\n   * Either take an old one and modify it to your liking, or build your own but use the old ones as a reference to save time and make sure you don’t screw up\n   * Many schools have an outline bank\n   * Many student orgs have outline banks\n   * Your PAs should provide old outlines, as will student org mentors (ask them!)  \n\n      * Unless your school doesn't have PAs or mentors, of course\n* It’s an iterative process – the outline is never “done”  \n\n   * You want to compile the information in a way that is both comprehensive and easy to navigate in your brain  \n\n      * Remember that you’ll be flipping through or CTRL-Fing it urgently to look up something during an exam\n      * Information recall speed and organization are key\n* It’s also a critical learning experience as you fit all the conceptual pieces together in your head and organize them in ways your brain understands  \n\n   * This is the main reason relying solely on old outlines is a problem\n* Ideally you should add to your outlines bit by bit as the semester goes on  \n\n   * BUT note that you will not be capable of doing much of the connective intellectual work until the end of the semester when you’ve seen enough of the class to understand how things fit\n* An “attack outline” is literally just your outline, but slimmed down so it’s faster to look stuff up\n\n**Practice Exams**\n\n* Don’t worry about this until like, November\n* But once you get to the last few weeks, and certainly reading period and finals, these will be critically important\n* Most profs will give you old exams, though some wait until late in the semester  \n\n   * If not, ask\n   * If you can’t get them, try to find exams from other profs, or the internet\n   * DON’T ask a 2/3L for them, because schools tend to get very touchy about it and you don't want to get the 2/3L (or yourself) in trouble\n* You really really really need to get hands on practice applying your knowledge and resources to hypos\n* You WILL feel panicked the first time you’re staring at a hypo and a blank page but you’ll figure it out  \n\n   * You want to work through this experience on a practice, not the real thing\n\n**Think outside the box**\n\n* That’s basically it for traditional law school study techniques, but feel free to experiment\n* I personally started using Excel spreadsheets and found them ultra useful - [here's an example](https://www.reddit.com/user/Oldersupersplitter/comments/iiuucb/excel_cases_outline_example/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n   * Each case (including the minor note cases) gets a line with the name, year, the topic, a few words of facts, and a very brief overview of why it matters\n   * I can see the entire possible body of law for each topic on a single screen\n   * You start to notice trends and connections differently than in Word\n* Flowcharts  \n\n   * I love flowcharts, and as a 2L used flowcharts almost exclusively during the actual exams (with other traditional tools available if needed) - here is [a link with some examples](https://www.reddit.com/user/Oldersupersplitter/comments/idkyr8/flowchart_examples/)\n   * There are white boards in many library study rooms\n   * I’ve now moved to the [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) website and find it easier to do electronically\n\n**Structuring your semester, revisited**\n\n* Now that we know what everything is….\n* Your #1 job is staying on top of the readings and class notes  \n\n   * Preferably staying slightly ahead on reading\n   * At the start, this is really your only goal\n* Review/revisit material periodically to refresh it and find connections  \n\n   * Some people do this at the end of each week, every couple weeks, etc\n* Talk to your classmates, talk to profs in office hours, try to learn wtf is going on\n* Look for old outlines day one, and refer to them as needed even before making your own\n* Start building your outlines and/or modifying old ones  \n\n   * Some people add a little each week, others only after 4-6 weeks, some at the end\n   * No correct answer, but certainly it’s good to at least start by November 1 if you can\n* In the second half of the semester, the focus shifts more and more from reading into outlining\n* In the final month, 90% of your time should be spent on outlining, practice exams, and filling in holes in your understanding  \n\n   * Those last two are more important than outlines, which is why it’s good to aim for progress on outlines early\n* Plan out the days you’ll prepare for each final, way before you need to  \n\n   * I like to give myself 30 days before the first final: one week per class, then two days at the end to cram before the first final\n   * Then, as soon as you take a final, forget everything and spend all of your time prepping for the next one, and so on until you’re done\n   * Plan to be ultra burned out after each final  \n\n      * If you can study, great\n      * But you will almost certainly not have the mental or emotional capacity to  study until the next day, maybe that evening at best, so don’t rely on that time when you’re planning\n\n**Study groups**\n\n* Can be incredible helpful\n* Can also be a huge distraction\n* Very very important for reviewing practice exams at the very end\n* Probably worth trying them, at least with one other student to bounce things off of\n* Be extremely cautious about wasting time  \n\n   * Your classmates are probably cool and interesting, and if you become besties, you might spend all your time chatting and enjoying each other’s company instead of studying\n   * It’s good to have a concrete game plan for each study session - save the socializing for when you go to the bar *after* an efficient and productive study session (both the studying and the drinking will be improved this way)\n   * Later in the semester, you can even calendar specific things to cover on specific days\n* Don’t be afraid to include people from the other section(s) that share your professors!\n\n**Productivity in general**\n\n* There are many common suggestions and tips for productivity that I won’t write about for pages and pages here because you can look them online or in books (and by getting to this point, you’re probably respectably productive anyway)  \n\n   * However, here are some law school-specific thoughts that I have based on not only my own experience, but also the experiences of my 3L friends and the 1Ls I’ve mentored...\n* ***If you tell me you “studied 10 hours in the library….”***\n* First, law students love to exaggerate these things (so don’t freak out when your classmates mention stuff like this), but let’s assume you actually did 10 hours\n* Second, how much time during those 10 hours were you ACTUALLY studying?  \n\n   * Many many many people, myself included, will go to the library or their desk at home to “study” but find themselves constantly distracted by the obvious things (facebook, games, online shopping, news, etc) but also less obvious things:  \n\n      * Talking to friends/study group about stuff that is not relevant to class\n      * Getting into deep philosophical arguments about legal theory that will make a great paper someday but have nothing to do with 1L exams\n      * Thinking about all the money you’ll make in BigLaw\n      * Thinking about how you’re going to save the world in PI\n      * Reading some interesting but irrelevant legal tangent because you don’t want to look at Torts any more that day\n      * Listening to friends in other sections talk about how *their* Contracts class is going\n      * Picking out the exact right shade of highlighter for highlighting today’s notes\n      * And so on…\n   * Sometimes you know that you’re not being productive if it’s Instagram, but many of these things I listed above might *feel like* you’re productive because they’re “about the law” or at least “law adjacent”  \n\n      * And hey, many of these things are great and valuable and you should do them…. But don’t count them as “study time” in your schedule or your head, because you will fool yourself into thinking you put in more hours than you did\n      * Instead, use your study time to *actually study* and then spend the same amount of time doing all that other stuff I listed but block it out during a *separate time* in the day\n      * You may end up with MORE time to do these things that interest you because you power through the real studying all at once, and then feel free to go on tangents and socialize to your hearts content without being chained to the library desk\n* Third, when you really truly are “studying,” what **specifically** does that mean and is it the most effective task at this moment?  \n\n   * This basically plays into everything I described about study habits above\n   * There are lots of tasks that do technically count as studying, and hey maybe you do them for 4 straight hours without talking to anyone or checking facebook…. But they don’t actually help you for the exam (or only help a little bit)\n   * Here is where briefing really ruins a lot of people, in my opinion\n   * What are some other examples of tasks I’ve heard of classmates doing that waste time (or that I’ve done myself and realized my mistake)?  \n\n      * Re-reading the case multiple times after already discussing it in class (just revisit your notes at that point)\n      * Reading parts of the textbook that aren’t in the syllabus\n      * Reading supplements for topics that aren’t in the syllabus\n      * Memorizing facts (unless you get the rare closed book exam)\n      * Making flashcards (same thing)\n      * Looking up the history around an area of law, or the voluminous academic scholarship around it (probably interesting, maybe valuable in the grand sense for your education, but do it in “non-study” time because it has no bearing on the exam unless the prof says it does or you’re very confident it will come up)\n      * Briefing (in my opinion)\n* **IF** you only spend your study time doing **effective, high-value tasks** (*assigned* reading, outlining, practice exams, reviewing notes, making visual aids for the exam, finding explanations to topics you don’t understand, filling in holes in your notes) and you also spend your “study time” **actually studying** without distraction  \n\n   * You will find that **the number of hours required to prepare thoroughly and get good grades is** **much smaller than you’d think**, and much smaller than the amount of time most students “study”\n   * This is how some people “magically” get good grades while also going to Bar Review, maintaining a relationship, playing video games, taking weekends off, etc.  \n\n      * And, because they have left so many hours each day/week to rest and relax, their brains are in a better position to perform well when it comes to study or take the exam!!\n* Of course, **I guarantee you will be nowhere near perfect** at this at the start, or even by the end of the first semester  \n\n   * But you should aspire toward efficiency and constantly ask yourself, *for you and the way YOU study effectively*, “am I actually studying during study time?” and “are my study tasks effective & efficient?”",

Recent UVA grad here. Congrats on finishing your first week of law school! I originally posted this guide a year ago, and have received countless messages ever since about how helpful it was. I wanted to repost it again now so that the new incoming 1Ls could see it and hopefully find it useful too.\n\n\nWhen I was a 1L, I was lucky enough to get lots of sage advice from Reddit, TLS, and older students at UVA. I wanted to pay it forward, and ask you to do the same. This guide represents all of the things I personally learned myself, advice I received over the years, and comments by dozens of top-performing students at UVA and other T14s who have given me feedback and helped me improve the contents. Historically, my 1L mentees who followed this guide have performed extremely well.\n\n\n\nWhen the time comes, you should also check out (1) [this post about what to do in the last month before finals, which focuses heavily on outlining](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/dtiy6y/detailed_game_plan_for_finals_for_all_the_anxious/) and (2) [this post about how exactly to write the exam itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/e7m4uz/for_1ls_a_detailed_guide_on_how_the_hell_you/).\n\n\nRemember that there is no \"right way\" to do law school, *including* my advice in this guide. You should listen to as much guidance as you can, then try things and decide what works for you personally. Nobody grades you on how you prepared, only on the final result in the exam room. [This post by moderator Hstrat](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/ng7e4z/aggregated_content_for_rising_1ls_and_others/) contains a priceless collection of other guides and AMAs across the internet that you should read as well, including some that helped me as a 1L several years ago. I recommend paying attention to even the ones that disagree with me :)\n\n\nFeel free to ask any questions below. Happy to turn this into a sort of AMA if that's helpful.\n\n**Caveats/Intro**\n\n* No advice is “correct” (including this), just suggestions to try for yourself\n* No one will ever see your notes/outlines/flashcards/etc, only the exam itself\n* The exam is 100% of your grade, so focus on that\n\n   * Your entire semester should work backwards from the exam\n   * Obviously if your syllabus says otherwise, adjust accordingly\n\n**Sleep/health/caffeine/drinking**\n\n* Your physical and mental health are important for obvious human reasons  \n\n   * They are ALSO critically important for grades\n* 1L is a marathon, not a sprint\n* You WILL burnout eventually  \n\n   * The question is when, how bad, and how fast can you bounce back?\n   * Delaying burnout and mitigating its intensity is key; health is critical to this\n* The increased brainpower, efficiency, and speed of being healthy, well-rested, and mentally/emotionally centered vastly outpaces any time “lost” from not studying more\n* Specifically: Sleep, exercise, diet, relaxation, reasonable levels of caffeine/alcohol/drugs  \n\n   * Sleep is absolute king here\n   * An hour of sleep is more valuable than an hour of anything else, including studying, job applications, exercise, socializing, etc. because it  makes all of those activities way better/easier during the rest of the  day\n\n**General life/social stuff**\n\n* Warn your family, friends, partner, etc. that law school is really intense and that 1L Fall is by far the most important semester  \n\n   * It will NOT be that bad, but it’s wise to set their expectations low and have them be pleasantly surprised that you’re available, rather than be mad that you’re not available enough\n   * They should be under the impression that your life will be 100% taken up by studying, until you’re comfortable enough with your schedule to inform them otherwise\n* Be nice to everyone, don’t start drama  \n\n   * This is all so much easier when you get along\n   * Contribute to and take advantage of the support network!\n   * Remember that every classmate will also be lawyer, in a very small world, and it’s better to be friends with the hiring partner, opponent, client, attorney general, judge, whatever than to have them remember when you tried to fight them on the softball field lol\n\n**Pacing/high-level overview**\n\n* Common mistakes: burnout too early, or (less common) slack until the end  \n\n   * You CANNOT push yourself round the clock in the library all day every day all semester – literally nobody can keep up this pace forever  \n\n      * Every year people try this, burn themselves out, and get wrecked in finals\n   * You should assume that you are totally average until 1L grades tell you otherwise  \n\n      * If you’re insecure that you’re not smart enough, you’re probably wrong (chances are you’re average)\n      * If you’re overconfident because you think you’re smarter than everyone else, you’re also probably wrong (chances are you’re average too)\n* You need a plan, and it should be ambitious but reasonable  \n\n   * Plan for problems/interruptions/sickness/distraction\n   * Leave slack in your schedule each week, and across the semester as a whole\n* Each hour of your time becomes more valuable the closer you get to finals  \n\n   * Thus, try to front-load tasks as much as possible without burning out\n\n**Work backwards from the exam**\n\n* The exam is the only thing that matters\n* Repeat: **THE EXAM IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS**  \n\n   * Plan the entire semester based on this realization\n   * Cases are important for learning, but pretty unimportant for the exam  \n\n      * Repeat: they *ARE important*, just not while sitting in the exam\n* So start by figuring out: what does the exam look like?  \n\n   * **NOTE**: Check the format with your professor, on the off-chance that it’s different… but most will be like this:\n   * A series of hypotheticals that you will need to analyze, often w/ little guidance, and write about in a Word doc for the professor (at some schools this may be done via special exam software but the content is the same)\n   * Extreme time pressure\n   * (Usually) open-book, open-note, even open-internet\n   * Blind grading (professor has no idea who you are)  \n\n      * Notably, they also don't know whether you nailed a cold call or bombed it\n   * Cases are used only for their key takeaway/rule, and maybe to analogize the most important facts to the exam hypo  \n\n      * *At most* you might say something like “Necessity is not a defense to murder (*Dudley*), so in this case John wouldn’t be able to raise it.”\n      * Or something like, “The workers here are independent contractors, but unlike the anesthesiologists in *Roessler*, they don’t seem to have apparent authority.”\n      * This kind of unofficial “citation” to a case is not only the maximum you’d have to do, it’s honestly more than most professors would expect or care about – you DO NOT have to even use cases to this degree\n      * The point is, a few days/weeks from now, when you’re spending so much time learning cases, reflect back on these examples in this post, and realize how little information you’ll actually use from them on the exam\n* So, now that you know what the exam involves, what sorts of tools would probably help you during the exam?  \n\n   * A gigantic, well-organized document with all the information from the class, that you can CTRL-F to find things  \n\n      * This is an “outline”\n   * Your raw class notes to CTRL-F in case you missed something  \n\n      * This is why you should take good notes\n   * A shorter document laying out only the most important info as a reminder, that you can glance at quickly mid-exam  \n\n      * This is an “attack outline”\n   * Other visual aids?  \n\n      * An excel database of cases w/ key info?\n      * Flowcharts?\n      * Other creative ideas?\n   * Knowing your professor’s opinions, preferences, quirks\n   * Practice: having done a very similar exam multiple times before  \n\n      * AKA “practice exams”\n   * General familiarity with the content from constant exposure  \n\n      * AKA consistent studying and review all semester\n* What will probably NOT help you during the exam:  \n\n   * Memorization (because it’s open note)\n   * Flashcards\n   * Details of case facts\n   * Full case briefs\n   * In-depth reasoning of majority/dissent\n   * Historical cases that are no longer relevant\n   * Highlighting in your casebook\n   * Rambling about general legal concepts not directly related to hypo\n   * Policy/theory/ethics  \n\n      * UNLESS explicitly asked, or specific prof likes it\n   * The opinions, preferences, quirks of your classmates\n* Thus, **devote more time to developing things that will help and less time to things that won’t help**  \n\n   * Don’t spend time on things just because they feel like “work” (ex. writing out a 2-page analysis of each case you read, making flashcards), or because your classmates are doing it, or older students say to do it, or even because professors say to do it (it’s been probably decades since they were in school)  \n\n      * **This includes not blindly listening to ME either!** Think critically and carefully about each task and consider whether it will really help you come exam time\n      * Solicit suggestions from 2/3Ls, classmates, profs, the internet, and try out their methods…. But be prepared to adapt to your own way, or toss them out\n* I have way more to say about exam nitty-gritty and strategy, but that should wait until much later in the semester  \n\n   * When the time comes, check out my post about [preparing for exams during the final month of the semester](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/dtiy6y/detailed_game_plan_for_finals_for_all_the_anxious/), followed by my post detailing [specific strategies for writing the exam itself once you're sitting in it](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/e7m4uz/for_1ls_a_detailed_guide_on_how_the_hell_you/)\n\n**Taking notes in class**\n\n* By far the most important thing you can do\n* The professor is judge, jury, and executioner of your exam  \n\n   * If you, the book, or supplements ever disagree with the professor, the professor is always right (for the exam anyway)\n   * Many profs will encourage you to challenge their ideas, either in class or in office hours…. But when it comes to the exam, follow what they think\n   * If you get a policy/political question, you may choose to argue a point that your prof disagrees with, if it’s truly a debatable non-settled non-legal question  \n\n      * But when it comes to “how does Torts work” your prof is always correct\n* For most profs, 99.9% of the information you’ll need will come up in class at some point (either from the prof, or from discussion w/ students)  \n\n   * This is part of why devoting too much time to reading/briefing isn’t worth it – you’ll get the info in class\n* Pay attention, take lots of notes, fill any holes either by asking classmates, revisiting the recordings, or going to office hours\n* Take your notes for each subject in one big combined Word doc, NOT separate docs for each class period (ex. all Crim notes in a single doc, not \"Crim August 26th\" and \"Crim August 28th\")\n\n   * Trust me, this will save you enormous time and effort later\n   * You can also use more sophisticated tools like One Note if you know how\n* If you handwrite, you will HAVE to transfer them to electronic form at  some point so you can use them for outlining and during the exam  \n\n   * Probably smart to set up a routine for doing this each week or other similar time period\n* Follow whatever style and format works best for your brain - nothing else matters\n\n**Reading**\n\n* Timing: probably good to get ahead, at least by a couple days  \n\n   * Aspire to finish the semester’s reading early if you can\n   * By reading ahead, you leave room for problems (if you get sick or have some deadline or are burned out, the punishment is being back on normal pace, rather than falling behind)\n   * BUT consider that being too far ahead means you forget details and can mess up cold calls  \n\n      * Probably good to do a quick refresh right before class\n   * Start to track how long it takes to read each page (this may be different for each class)  \n\n      * Not to be a gunner, but so that you can accurately estimate time for each assignment\n      * You *will* get faster as the semester goes on (often significantly faster) - this is part of the normal law school process\n* Read every word carefully the first time through\n* Try really hard to understand what’s going on factually and legally\n* Try to figure out how each judge is making their arguments\n* Practice distilling the key questions:  \n\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, what are the facts?\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, what legal rule comes out of this?\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, what did the dissent say (if any)?\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, is there any other context/info from book?\n   * Ex. *R v. Dudley & Stevens*  \n\n      * Facts: “Two guys starving on boat eat third guy”\n      * Law: “Rule: necessity is not a valid defense to murder”\n      * Context: “This is an old English case and American law is a bit different now”\n* Probably smart to write down those super brief, super important summaries in case you get cold called, though it’s not strictly necessary  \n\n   * However….\n\n**Briefing**\n\n* CONTROVERSIAL: should you write down *all* of those facts, details, arguments, and legal minutiae from the reading?  \n\n   * This is called “briefing”\n   * Doing this is part of traditional law school advice, but highly controversial\n   * There seems to be a modern trend away from briefing\n* Briefing pros:  \n\n   * Cold calls are way easier\n   * You never need to revisit the book because it’s all there\n   * Helps some people remember facts/arguments/details better\n   * May force you to understand things better\n* Briefing cons:  \n\n   * Takes an absolutely enormous amount of time\n   * Most of the information is unnecessary outside of cold calls\n   * Will never be used on an actual exam\n   * You can survive a cold call without it\n   *

including me, think they’re a waste of time  \n\n   * The ratio of time required to value gained is insanely wasteful\n   * They mostly help cold calls… and cold calls have no impact on your grade\n   * Many people study tons of hours and burn out… yet get bad grades?  \n\n      * Too much time spent briefing is often the culprit\n      * Briefing *feels like* you’re being productive and *feels like* you’re “learning” and “being a good law student” and “accomplishing something”… but many people discover come exam time that **those efforts don’t translate into results**\n   * Easy to be too perfectionist or worry about things like formatting, that no one will ever see\n   * Try it, maybe it works for you, but be ready to abandon if necessary\n   * Only do it if  \n\n      * a) you have no other more valuable tasks to do and\n      * b) are totally well-rested, relaxed, and bored and need no rest time\n   * I would much rather spend an hour reading ahead, outlining, doing practice exams (late in the semester), doing career services tasks, taking care of personal errands, making flowcharts, revising my notes, reviewing my notes, etc. than I would an hour of briefing\n   * I would also much rather spend an hour sleeping, partying, watching Netflix, jogging, etc. than an hour briefing, because my energy will recharge and make be more productive at other more important tasks\n* MIDDLE GROUND: “Book Briefing”  \n\n   * Highlight important things\n   * Make notes in the margins\n   * Don’t actually write out a full brief\n   * Many people like this solution\n\n**Outlining**\n\n* Sounds scarier than it is  \n\n   * Literally just compile your notes into one big document, edit it a bit, and format so it’s easy to look stuff up/organize\n   * If you add something to the outline you don’t understand or remember, revisit your notes/book/friends/supplements/professor to figure it out  \n\n      * Eventually you’ll understand everything\n* Use old outlines!  \n\n   * Everyone agrees you shouldn’t just use an old outline straight up (and sometimes profs don’t allow it)\n   * But you don’t necessarily need to take the time to build one from scratch\n   * Either take an old one and modify it to your liking, or build your own but use the old ones as a reference to save time and make sure you don’t screw up\n   * Many schools have an outline bank\n   * Many student orgs have outline banks\n   * Your PAs should provide old outlines, as will student org mentors (ask them!)  \n\n      * Unless your school doesn't have PAs or mentors, of course\n* It’s an iterative process – the outline is never “done”  \n\n   * You want to compile the information in a way that is both comprehensive and easy to navigate in your brain  \n\n      * Remember that you’ll be flipping through or CTRL-Fing it urgently to look up something during an exam\n      * Information recall speed and organization are key\n* It’s also a critical learning experience as you fit all the conceptual pieces together in your head and organize them in ways your brain understands  \n\n   * This is the main reason relying solely on old outlines is a problem\n* Ideally you should add to your outlines bit by bit as the semester goes on  \n\n   * BUT note that you will not be capable of doing much of the connective intellectual work until the end of the semester when you’ve seen enough of the class to understand how things fit\n* An “attack outline” is literally just your outline, but slimmed down so it’s faster to look stuff up\n\n**Practice Exams**\n\n* Don’t worry about this until like, November\n* But once you get to the last few weeks, and certainly reading period and finals, these will be critically important\n* Most profs will give you old exams, though some wait until late in the semester  \n\n   * If not, ask\n   * If you can’t get them, try to find exams from other profs, or the internet\n   * DON’T ask a 2/3L for them, because schools tend to get very touchy about it and you don't want to get the 2/3L (or yourself) in trouble\n* You really really really need to get hands on practice applying your knowledge and resources to hypos\n* You WILL feel panicked the first time you’re staring at a hypo and a blank page but you’ll figure it out  \n\n   * You want to work through this experience on a practice, not the real thing\n\n**Think outside the box**\n\n* That’s basically it for traditional law school study techniques, but feel free to experiment\n* I personally started using Excel spreadsheets and found them ultra useful - [here's an example](https://www.reddit.com/user/Oldersupersplitter/comments/iiuucb/excel_cases_outline_example/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n   * Each case (including the minor note cases) gets a line with the name, year, the topic, a few words of facts, and a very brief overview of why it matters\n   * I can see the entire possible body of law for each topic on a single screen\n   * You start to notice trends and connections differently than in Word\n* Flowcharts  \n\n   * I love flowcharts, and as a 2L used flowcharts almost exclusively during the actual exams (with other traditional tools available if needed) - here is [a link with some examples](https://www.reddit.com/user/Oldersupersplitter/comments/idkyr8/flowchart_examples/)\n   * There are white boards in many library study rooms\n   * I’ve now moved to the [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) website and find it easier to do electronically\n\n**Structuring your semester, revisited**\n\n* Now that we know what everything is….\n* Your #1 job is staying on top of the readings and class notes  \n\n   * Preferably staying slightly ahead on reading\n   * At the start, this is really your only goal\n* Review/revisit material periodically to refresh it and find connections  \n\n   * Some people do this at the end of each week, every couple weeks, etc\n* Talk to your classmates, talk to profs in office hours, try to learn wtf is going on\n* Look for old outlines day one, and refer to them as needed even before making your own\n* Start building your outlines and/or modifying old ones  \n\n   * Some people add a little each week, others only after 4-6 weeks, some at the end\n   * No correct answer, but certainly it’s good to at least start by November 1 if you can\n* In the second half of the semester, the focus shifts more and more from reading into outlining\n* In the final month, 90% of your time should be spent on outlining, practice exams, and filling in holes in your understanding  \n\n   * Those last two are more important than outlines, which is why it’s good to aim for progress on outlines early\n* Plan out the days you’ll prepare for each final, way before you need to  \n\n   * I like to give myself 30 days before the first final: one week per class, then two days at the end to cram before the first final\n   * Then, as soon as you take a final, forget everything and spend all of your time prepping for the next one, and so on until you’re done\n   * Plan to be ultra burned out after each final  \n\n      * If you can study, great\n      * But you will almost certainly not have the mental or emotional capacity to  study until the next day, maybe that evening at best, so don’t rely on that time when you’re planning\n\n**Study groups**\n\n* Can be incredible helpful\n* Can also be a huge distraction\n* Very very important for reviewing practice exams at the very end\n* Probably worth trying them, at least with one other student to bounce things off of\n* Be extremely cautious about wasting time  \n\n   * Your classmates are probably cool and interesting, and if you become besties, you might spend all your time chatting and enjoying each other’s company instead of studying\n   * It’s good to have a concrete game plan for each study session - save the socializing for when you go to the bar *after* an efficient and productive study session (both the studying and the drinking will be improved this way)\n   * Later in the semester, you can even calendar specific things to cover on specific days\n* Don’t be afraid to include people from the other section(s) that share your professors!\n\n**Productivity in general**\n\n* There are many common suggestions and tips for productivity that I won’t write about for pages and pages here because you can look them online or in books (and by getting to this point, you’re probably respectably productive anyway)  \n\n   * However, here are some law school-specific thoughts that I have based on not only my own experience, but also the experiences of my 3L friends and the 1Ls I’ve mentored...\n* ***If you tell me you “studied 10 hours in the library….”***\n* First, law students love to exaggerate these things (so don’t freak out when your classmates mention stuff like this), but let’s assume you actually did 10 hours\n* Second, how much time during those 10 hours were you ACTUALLY studying?  \n\n   * Many many many people, myself included, will go to the library or their desk at home to “study” but find themselves constantly distracted by the obvious things (facebook, games, online shopping, news, etc) but also  less obvious things:  \n\n      * Talking to friends/study group about stuff that is not relevant to class\n      * Getting into deep philosophical arguments about legal theory that will make a great paper someday but have nothing to do with 1L exams\n      * Thinking about all the money you’ll make in BigLaw\n      * Thinking about how you’re going to save the world in PI\n      * Reading some interesting but irrelevant legal tangent because you don’t want to look at Torts any more that day\n      * Listening to friends in other sections talk about how *their* Contracts class is going\n      * Picking out the exact right shade of highlighter for highlighting today’s notes\n      * And so on…\n   * Sometimes you know that you’re not being productive if it’s Instagram, but many of these things I listed above might *feel like* you’re productive because they’re “about the law” or at least “law adjacent”  \n\n      * And hey, many of these things are great and valuable and you should do  them…. But don’t count them as “study time” in your schedule or your  head, because you will fool yourself into thinking you put in more hours  than you did\n      * Instead, use your study time to *actually study* and then spend the same amount of time doing all that other stuff I listed but block it out during a *separate time* in the day\n      * You may end up with MORE time to do these things that interest you because you power through the real studying all at once, and then feel free to go on tangents and socialize to your hearts content without being  chained to the library desk\n* Third, when you really truly are “studying,” what **specifically** does that mean and is it the most effective task at this moment?  \n\n   * This basically plays into everything I described about study habits above\n   * There  are lots of tasks that do technically count as studying, and hey maybe you do them for 4 straight hours without talking to anyone or checking  facebook…. But they don’t actually help you for the exam (or only help a  little bit)\n   * Here is where briefing really ruins a lot of people, in my opinion\n   * What are some other examples of tasks I’ve heard of classmates doing that waste time (or that I’ve done myself and realized my mistake)?  \n\n      * Re-reading the case multiple times after already discussing it in class (just revisit your notes at that point)\n      * Reading parts of the textbook that aren’t in the syllabus\n      * Reading supplements for topics that aren’t in the syllabus\n      * Memorizing facts (unless you get the rare closed book exam)\n      * Making flashcards (same thing)\n      * Looking up the history around an area of law, or the voluminous academic  scholarship around it (probably interesting, maybe valuable in the grand  sense for your education, but do it in “non-study” time because it has  no bearing on the exam unless the prof says it does or you’re very  confident it will come up)\n      * Briefing (in my opinion)\n* **IF** you only spend your study time doing **effective, high-value tasks** (*assigned*  reading, outlining, practice exams, reviewing notes, making visual aids  for the exam, finding explanations to topics you don’t understand,  filling in holes in your notes) and you also spend your “study time” **actually studying** without distraction  \n\n   * You will find that **the number of hours required to prepare thoroughly and get good grades is** **much smaller than you’d think**, and much smaller than the amount of time most students “study”\n   * This  is how some people “magically” get good grades while also going to Bar  Review, maintaining a relationship, playing video games, taking weekends  off, etc.  \n\n      * And, because they have left so many hours each day/week to rest and relax, their brains are in a better position to perform well when it comes to  study or take the exam!!\n* Of course, **I guarantee you will be nowhere near perfect** at this at the start, or even by the end of the first semester  \n\n   * But you should aspire toward efficiency and constantly ask yourself, *for you and the way YOU study effectively*, “am I actually studying during study time?” and “are my study tasks effective & efficient?”",

    "text": "Out of all the cases you've read so far, which one(s) pissed you off the most, and why? &nbsp;Have y'all ever read a case that boils your blood and ruins your day even just thinking about it? We all have those specific decisions that make us feel some kind of way, and I'd love to know which ones have affected you the most. I can't tell you how many times so-called jurisprudence made my jaw drop by irrationally legitimizing some serious bullshit. This might sound silly, but sometimes I'll get seriously pissed off thinking about judges who've a mockery of the law by perverting the very institution protecting our rights into promulgating injustices. Here's my list of the some of the cases I consider to be among the most egregious examples of this. Let's get the most obvious one out of the way. You already know which one it is without me even having to say it:\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n***Dred Scott v. Sandford.*** Universally regarded as the worst Supreme Court decision of all time, and rightfully so. The ghost of Roger Taney can catch these fucking hands any day of the week. The institution of American chattel slavery was an abomination to both God and mankind, a crime so unbelievably heinous that even those who tacitly endorse it are profoundly evil. But a man who abuses his immense power attempting to perpetuate that horror forever, well, he's cast himself down to the very bottom of the lowest circle of hell and started digging. Not only did it deprive African Americans of the basic rights even the racist Founding Fathers allowed them, it became a catalyst for the bloodiest war in our country's history. This smug piece of shit, believing he'd settled the slavery question forever, wrote words that killed hundreds of thousands of people and dehumanized even more.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n Yet **even someone who'd actually agree with dooming an entire race to lacking any rights whatsoever** couldn't even justify effectuating it the way the Court did, because this unbelievable asshole not only wrote his opinion *after* dismissing Scott's claim on standing grounds, he also attached a completely unrelated coda invalidating the Missouri Compromise when he had absolutely no authority to do so. Anyone with even cursory knowledge of the law can see his violation of the separation of powers in effectively legislating from the bench. The Chief Justice is supposed to be the brightest legal mind we have, so that bastard knew exactly what he was doing. His disgusting attack on the Compromise was, in effect, an advisory opinion masquerading as \"jurisprudence\" comparable to a five-year-old's crayon drawing of a swastika. Even worse, six other Justices participated in this gang-rape of the very rights our country was founded on. It was not only substantively unjust but procedurally unjust as well. The only two men with any sort of backbone in this story are Dred Scott himself and Justice Robbins (the only Supreme Court justice to resign on principle.) The rest of them deserve to burn (and yes, that includes McLean too).  \n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***McClesky v. Kemp.*** What do you get when you combine racism, injustice, and denial of not only factual proof but basic mathematics itself? You get an extraordinarily tragic and infuriating example of how courts have continued to deprive African Americans of their voice in the judicial process even almost a century and a half after the Dred Scott decision. The abolition of the pre-Furman framework for capital punishment was in large part due to systematic racial disparities in the imposition of death sentences. Our current post-Gregg framework, in contrast, was partly born from Georgia's desire to absolutely kill the shit out of Troy Gregg, as one of five states providing a template for the reintroduction of capital punishment. To do so, they convoluted their process in a way that addressed every concern in *Furman* to comply with the Eighth Amendment, and quickly extinguished any other lingering constitutional issues (e.g. Coker v. Georgia). This case directly exposed the post-Gregg framework as the charade it always was; a continuation of the policy of certain death for black defendants alleged to have committed **any** sort of crime against a white victim. \n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disparity was always odious and obvious; black men accused of raping white women were almost always executed, with very few exceptions, if they even had the chance to make it the gallows before they were lynched by a mob. In contrast, the execution of white defendants for rape was very rare, and almost all of these cases involved defendants convicted of raping a child. McClesky's thorough, comprehensive, scientific analysis of every single Georgia death sentence statistically proved that black defendants accused of killing white victims were **TWENTY-TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE A DEATH SENTENCE THAN BLACK DEFENDANTS ACCUSED OF KILLING BLACK VICTIMS**, and more than seven times more likely to be sentenced to death than white defendants convicted of killing a black victim. The denial of such empirical and objective data can't be adequately explained by anything other than the majority advocating, or at the very least actively condoning systematic racism. \n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nThis alone is already unconscionable from the highest court in the land, but the most egregious part of this case is Powell's inexplicable and unconstitutional assertion that **even if Georgia's sentencing policy being racist were taken as true** (remember, their pledged avoidance of this was the whole basis they were allowed to bring it back)  McClesky had no recourse because no racial bias could be proven **in his specific case.** I can't even explain how wrong that is, on so many different grounds. The granting of rights to everyone through the granting of rights to an individual plaintiff has long been one of the most basic cornerstones of judicial function, and denying that to McClesky was, in effect,  a denial of rights to all African Americans, and it killed him. Even Powell himself admitted years later that he wished he could go back and change his vote. Unfortunately, McClesky had already been executed by then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***Ashcroft v. Iqbal.*** This is an example of a recent case that makes scholars throw up their hands and go, \"yeah, I get it, but... come on, seriously?\". It's the legal equivalent of what happens when an unstoppable force (Iqbal's claims) meets an immovable object (the US government's storied commitment to covering its own ass when committing human rights abuses.) The extraordinary lengths the government went to in order fuck over just one guy over were so extensive that they irreversibly changed the way the ENTIRE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM WORKS, FOR EVERYONE, disadvantaging every single civil plaintiff in the the past thirteen years, just to deny this one guy his basic rights. The Court's complete disregard for the well-settled logic behind the doctrine of respondeat superior and vicarious liability is already bad enough, but its extraordinary far-reaching consequences for civil procedure have irreparably harmed the whole idea of what litigation actually exists for, and will most likely continue to do so for a very long time. \n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis completely unwarranted, arbitrary imposition of the plausibility standard infected a mostly-objective process with an extremely dangerous element of subjectiveness. Who's to say what's actually \"plausible\"? The previous framework was imperfect but far more just: claims were dismissed immediately if they were obviously factually impossible, vexatious, malicious, 12(b)(6)'d, or otherwise unacceptable for litigation. these standards are not only very clear, but necessarily mostly or completely dependent upon consideration of objective facts. Plausible? I'll tell you what's fucking plausible. It's plausible that the Supreme Court secretly conspired with the executive branch to change the way the whole game is played, just to excuse its abuse and arbitrary detention of Arab Muslims in the aftermath of 9/11. It's plausible that they were looking for the a perfect test case to come along and serve as the excuse to introduce this plausibility standard, and this one just happened to be the right fit. And it's *extremely* plausible that everyone responsible for this decision can suck my nuts, because the last thing on Earth I ever needed as a manic 1L was a few dozen more pages of Civil Procedure reading than I otherwise wouldn't have had. Thanks a lot!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***Bank Markazi v. Peterson.*** Iran, Iran, Iran. How many times have we seen the incredible lengths our judiciary has gone to in order to break the fundamental rules of our own laws? They love to carve convenient exceptions out of the very concept of what laws and precedents mean, just to get back at them for the 1979 hostage crisis. That's the only explanation for all these similar rulings involving Iran -- far too many to list here -- that completely defy any logical justification and contradict everything the separation of powers stands for. The prohibition on legislative meddling in the specific outcomes of individual cases is, and always has been, one of the most important protections of the separation of powers, without which judicial power becomes completely meaningless, I mean like seriously  on some pre-Marbury shit, so it's one of the most important safeguards we have against violating that separation. Allowing the legislature to influence cases this way is downright incestuous, a distant and obviously legally different kissing cousin to the idea behind double jeopardy as well, if the legislature truly wants to play house like that and act as a quasi-judiciary (although not everyone would agree with this comparison, I know that's kind of a stretch.) \n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe judiciary means absolutely nothing without the absolute assurance of its finality. The judiciary interprets the legislature, and allowing the legislature to have any control at all over a pending judicial action would in effect allow the legislature to interpret itself. I don't have to expound on how dangerous that is. Justifying this decision on the argument that this law is acceptable because it applies only to a specific pending trial rather than its outcome, or other unrelated trials, and only eliminates all of one party's defenses rather than deciding their fate entirely, has the ultimate effect of arbitrarily giving Iran a snowball's chance in hell of exercising the same rights any other defendant would have. It's the legal equivalent of a boxing match where one of the fighters has both of his hands tied behind his back. Not only was this decision an egregious denial of due process to one defendant under a certain docket number, this was done with FIFTEEN OTHER DOCKET NUMBERS. I know they're still salty about the hostage crisis, but opening up a portal between two sources of power designed to be eternally immiscible creates the possibility of applying it to cases involving Americans as well, or really, anyone. The fact that Justice Ginsburg, of all people, wrote the majority opinion is shocking to say the least.\n\nAnyway, what cases have pissed you off the most, and why?",

    "text": "[VENT]Had a judge tell me \"I'm not even going to bother pronouncing your last name\" I do an activity called Mock Trial where  you're given a case (this year, we have to find out whether the defendant poisoned someone with pesticide) and you pretend to be an attorney/witness. It's like a normal Trial with a judge and everything, and you're scored based on how well your team presents its case as well as other factors. \n\nIn Mock Trial, judges dont ever even have to say the name of the attorney. Usually, you can just refer to them as \"Plantiff/Prosecution\" or \"Defense\".\n\nIt felt so targeted. In the beginning of Trial, all the attorneys are introduced to the judge. He specifically picked me out and told ME \"I'm not gonna bother to pronounce your name, so I'm going to call you ma'am.\"\n\nThere were about 4-5 other people I can say with definite confidence that had harder names to pronounce than me. 2 of those people were white and he pronounced it literally perfectly. \n\nI dont understand. Why did he feel so strongly about it that he had to tell me in front of the whole room? At the end of Trial, he told me I was \"too aggressive and harsh\" with the witness, and I need to \"tone it down\"........I didnt even have enough time to get what I wanted from the witness before time elapsed. \n\nSometimes I feel like I'll never be able to go as far as I can with this activity because there will always be racist judges to knock my progress down. It's so disheartening and sometimes I want to quit but I love this activity too much ):",

    "text": "Saw the one and only black female obgyn in the area - and it didn’t go well Little background bout me - I’m 22 years old, and pretty anti western medicine to begin with. I’m also pro-choice and needed someone to talk to about BC options for me. Had a bad experience with white male docs last summer and I wasn’t trying to subject myself to that again.\n\nI don’t want to get too deep into it, but basically I live in a very predominantly white + Asian area (bay area CA) and needed to see an obgyn. I searched all over the internet to find this woman, and I guessed judged a book by its cover.\n\nWent in last week and the first thing I saw in the office were mommy magazines and tiny figurines of what I assume was the birth of baby Jesus on the front desk. I should’ve known from that point that I didn’t need to be there. 😅 When she saw me it was like the nice act immediately dropped once it was clear I wasn’t looking to have a baby anytime soon. She was very cold and matter of fact with me, and wasn’t very welcoming or understanding. Didn’t show any compassion when I told her my story. I even tried to hint at how hard it is to find the right doctor as a black woman and she didn’t really pick up on that. She did my Pap smear (didn’t warn me about the discomfort either) and then had her nurse tell me days later I had BV and needed to pick up a prescription that has since been giving me terrible nausea. \n\nNow I know not all black women are the same, and that maybe I shouldn’t have expected a grandmotherly experience just because we share skin color. But I just feel like given the context of this past year alone, the statistics around black women and reproductive health, and the fact that she’s the only black female obgyn in the area.... like am I wrong to have wanted a little more warmth from her?? I’m very disappointed and honestly have had better experiences at my local underfunded planned parenthood 🥴",

    "text": "I wish there wasn’t always better a while ago I searched up “beautiful Africans Quora” and saw questions like “why are East Africans women so beautiful” and “why do East African women look so different?” I was confused bc I didn’t know this was a thing?? Like I knew of colorism and mixed black women (especially when ambiguous looking) commonly being seen as more attractive than darker black women, but East African preference was new to me as someone who has never really lived around East Africans. \n\nI searched up what East Africans looked like and yeah, it made sense. They have the smaller noses, smaller lips, soft wavy hair, etc, all the features not commonly associated with the rest of Africa / slave descendant black Americans (who are primarily from west Africa). \n\nI looked into it and found out that bc of the region’s isolationism throughout the centuries, there is a lot less physical diversity than in other regions of Africa. So that’s why it’s not rare to see a west African or black American w/ a small nose but it is rare to see an East African w/ a big nose. \n\nAnyways i know I shouldn’t have, but I kept  looking and y’all I was so exhausted. There are so many questions on Quora / Reddit about East Africans’ “exotic” look and beauty compared to “regular” black people, like I know I should’ve expected it cus ofc Eurocentric features on dark skin will always be seen as more attractive than Afro centric feature on dark skin, but still it just hurt bc it feels like there’s always another group that’s perceived as better. \n\nRappers like drake talk about East Africans a lot in their music too which is especially frustrating bc it’s like they try to pass it off as black girl appreciation, while only ever praising one specific subset of black people who’a features commonly fit into European beauty standards.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way? This isn’t hate towards any East Africans or an attempt to undermine their beauty, it’s obviously not their fault that society is like this, it’s more just a rant about how even within the black community, there’s still a hierarchy based on how Eurocentric ur features are. I just wish beauty wasn’t judged through a white lens \n\n\nEdit: my intent is definitely not to incite drama, it’s just something that’s been hurting me for a while but if it is breaking the rules, I’ll definitely take it down",

    "text": "Dear Postgraduate Black Americans studying in the UK: ©️world2021 \n\nDear Postgraduate Black Americans studying in the UK: \n\n**THE BAD**\nYou will be the only one if you're in the arts/humanities at postgraduate level and chose your supervisor for their expertise (as you should) rather than choosing to be in London or Manchester to be surrounded by other black people. \n\n**THE NEUTRAL**\nYou are probably currently residing amongst a lot of Chinese postgrads if you're in halls. They may or may not be open to you. \n\n**THE GOOD**\nThis is an opportunity to get to know a more diverse set group of people than you've (probably) previously mixed with socially. Embrace that. \n\n**THE BRITISH**\nPeople like to think of themselves as tolerant, fair and most definitely not racist. You will judge for yourself the extent to which that's true or not, but that's how people tend to think. You will at times encounter ignorance, especially if absolutely everyone is white, but it's highly unlikely to be the case within a university. Where you do encounter ignorance, most people will be open to discussion in the right setting. They will be horrified to know they've caused unintended offence. (No that doesn't necessarily make it ok.) \n\nNow for some advice. Note, you will almost always be understood regardless of what you say, so some of the later language advice is simply to avoid inadvertently irritating us. \n\n**MEETING & COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER PEOPLE** - THE DOS \n\n+ Be open to everyone. \n\n+ Take people as you find them, not as you expect to find them. \n\n+ Always join your colleagues when invited to the pub. (Until such time as you decide that you definitely, 100% cannot stand them, if that happens) \n\n+ Go to fresher's week. Join clubs and societies around activities that interest you. *This will probably be you best source of friendship.* \n\n+ Visit every museum you can - they're mostly free \n\n+ Take advantage of student discounts, especially for cultural activities like live theatre. Ask the Student Union for more info. \n\n+ Visit other parts of the UK (there will be discounted tours-again you'll find organisers in Fresher's Week). \n\n+ Visit Europe for more than a day's shopping trip. North Africa is also close and relatively inexpensive. \n\n+ Join a religious community if that's important to you. \n\n+ Try to be specific in your use of language. E.g. *I'm from the South*...of...? Texas? The States? Scotland? England? London? Cornwall? \n\n+ Mind your Ps & Qs (🔍) - always, always say thank you. It is not necessary to respond to a thank you. \n\n+ Learn how we use the terms race and especially [ethnicity here](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/ ) \n\n+ Watch *Question Time* and *Newsnight* on BBC2 or iplayer to get a better understanding of British politics, especially the views of the 'left' and 'right' which you may find surprising as the terms do not correlate with American usage. Or don't. \n\n+ Look for opportunities to contribute - for example, by volunteering as a mentor in a local school. Black arts and humanities academics are rare. Be the change you want to see. Or don't. \n\n**MEETING & COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER PEOPLE** - THE DON’TS \n\n+ Don't take offence to any of the following if it doesn’t apply to you. This has taken a long time to compile, is based on experience of black Americans in British universities, and I'm only trying to help you. \n\n+ Do not generalise and say *Britain/the UK is like x* or *British people are like y* if you've only been to whatever part of it you're in. You'll offend. (See, be specific above) \n\n+ Do not say that you go to school. You go to university or uni. Only children go to school. \n\n+ Do not exclude anyone as a potential friend on the grounds of race, religion or sexuality. \n\n+ Do not assume that mixed-race people identify as black. They may and they may not. \n\n+ Do not assume that others share your religious beliefs, if you have any. Most Brits (Europeans) are irreligious and secular; even most who describe themselves as 'Christian' often merely mean that they were baptised as an infant or that they're white or that they're *not* a Muslim or Hindu. \n\n+ Do not fear: Muslims (potential friends and allies), terrorism (that would just be unpreventable very, very bad luck) or knife crime (no one is looking for you). \n\n**MEETING OTHER BLACK PEOPLE** \n\n+ Join the ACS (Afro-Caribbean society) to meet fellow black students. \n\n+ Go to uni club nights that play your sort of music if that's your thing. (Prob Thursdays if you like Afrobeats, R&B etc. Don't expect it to be majority black though). \n\n+ Use meetup.com to find black locals who want to mingle. Unless you're in the countryside, there probably *are* ethnic minorities where you live but they are not likely to live anywhere near your university. \n\n+ Go to the pub (the repetition is deliberate). Drink alcohol; don't drink alcohol. But whatever you drink, go. \n\nWelcome and enjoy!",

A lot of people believe respectability politics is bs but few people actually change their approach to life to reflect that. Folks will still judge others based on stuff that doesn't really matter and then point toward things like \"common sense,\" \"politeness,\" and \"manners\" to justify why they ridicule, ostracize, and treat others as if they are unworthy of respect. \n\nFolks still pass down these ideas of who is and isn't worthy of respect in society to their kids, based NOT on the violent and antagonistic actions of others but instead on arbitrary behaviors that literally hurt nobody. Folks are slipping through the cracks and losing employment and COMMUNITY because they can't read body language, or because they're too broke or mentally ill to pretend to care about these arbitrary rules, or because people take one look at them and decide they're not worthy of respect before they can even open their mouths. How is it that we have any modicum respect for our murderous governments and yet we denounce powerless individuals with little resources so easily?  \n\nFolks will scream from the rooftops that respectability politics is trash but, at the end of the day, this shit is still going on in the workplace. Kids are bullying each other because their first bullies are their own parents who tell them that they deserve to be treated like trash if they don't behave in \"respectable\" ways. We literally, PHYSICALLY reproduce respectability politics by passing it onto the next generation, which will pass it on to the next, and so on. \n\nTo DISRUPT this cycle and not just talk about disrupting it, I thought it would be cool if the folks who make an effort to change how respectability is used as a tool of exclusion and denial of resources would share how they do that and how they manage any problems that might arise, etc.\n\nSomeone who is all-talk at best is talking something that they're not backing up which begs the question, why say anything at all? Many respond, \"for clout\"--but I'm actually assuming it's because folks really do believe that respectability politics is trash and don't know where to start. It can be intimidating especially at work to act like your boss's standards for work are stupid af even if they are. \n\nBut this isn't just about whether or not white people welcome us into spaces--we have a shit ton of disabled folks, second language learners and folks who can't code switch, gender non-conforming people and other people who are labeled non-respectable from the OUTSET that NEED us to get our shit together and stop villifying arbitrary, harmless behaviors. \n\nSo, what do you do?",

See below for all the studies. What do you expect when feminsim teaches extreme misnadry, male privelge theory etc.... that feminise teachers will be like this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrevious submission got deleted by mod eventually so reposting here... still check it out as many excellent comments from men and women about their experience of this bias... many pointed out very obvious misandric comments from their teachers, some teachers even commented about their biases:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers\\_mark\\_girls\\_higher\\_for\\_identical\\_work\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers_mark_girls_higher_for_identical_work_to/)\n\nThis is an unpopular fact as it widely held in society that women and girls are discriminated against in education and in work, indeed in everything in life.\n\nNote; below is general statement, countless awesome teachers but....\n\n**Education is an example of institutional sexism. Now this data should to even feminist not be surprising... after all they call male majority and even female majority places as rife with sexism and \"male norms\" i.e. women have to act like men... is it any surprise then in teaching where 98% of early educators are female, 90% primary school teachers are female and these teachers have often studied gender studies type radical subjects at uni, and all HR and admin is female, that there is \"female norms\" being applied in education..... that the default child is a girl according to teachers? As the following data shows e.g. female teachers punishing boys for entirely normal behaviour that they dont understand; marking girls higher for IDENTICAL work, and giving higher predicted grades (despite boys objectively getting higher real life assesments) as they prefer girl students as model students and can relate to girl students better.... it is no wonder that schools are reducing play times, even removing physical education completely and replacing it with in class movement.... i.e. an entirely anti boy environment.... if 40% of boys are being drugged with aderal in some schools, do you think 40% of boys are unwell or maybe its the teachers who are shit and the system they made?**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOver then entire OECD countries globally, a large scale study showed that girls were given higher marks for IDENTICAL work to boys. OECD also showed that a boy receives 1/3 higher grade if the teacher does not know he is a boy. Interestingly this gender gap goes away when it is a male teacher doing the marking.\n\n[https://www.tes.com/news/teacher-stereotyping-means-higher-marks-girls-says-oecd](https://www.tes.com/news/teacher-stereotyping-means-higher-marks-girls-says-oecd)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/eliminating-feminist-teacher-bias-erases-boys-falling-grades-study-finds](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/eliminating-feminist-teacher-bias-erases-boys-falling-grades-study-finds)\n\nCornwell found that boys in all racial categories are not being *“commensurately graded by their teachers”* in any subject *“as their test scores would predict.”*\n\nThe answer lies in the way teachers, who are statistically mostly women, evaluate students without reference to objective test scores. Boys are regularly graded well below their actual academic performance.\n\nBoys are falling significantly behind in grades, *“despite performing as least as well as girls on math tests, and significantly better on science tests.”*\n\nAfter fifth grade, he found, student assessment becomes a matter of *“a teacher’s subjective assessment of the student’s performance”*, and is further removed from the guidance of objective test results. Teachers, he says, tend to assess students on non-cognitive, *“socio-emotional skills.”*This has had a significant impact on boys’ later achievement because, while objective test scores are important, it is teacher-assigned grades that determine a child’s future with class placement, high school graduation and college admissibility.\n\nEliminating the factor of *“non-cognitive skills…almost eliminates the estimated gender gap in reading grades”*, Cornwell found. He said he found it *“surprising”* that although boys out-perform girls on math and science test scores, girls out-perform boys on teacher-assigned grades.\n\nThe report also found that:\n\n* At primary level 85% of teachers are female. This has remained roughly the same since 2003.\n* At secondary level the percentage of male teachers has fallen steadily at first and later precipitously from 40% in 2003 to 31.7% in 2012.\n\n**It has been shown that boys and girls do better in reading when they have a same sex teacher. Just one year with a male teacher reduced the reading gap by 1/3 for 13 year old boys.

[https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/yq24b](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/yq24b)\n\nIn another study in the work place researchers asked supervisors to grade two poorly written essays and to provide feedback directly to each writer over chat, so that the writer could improve. At this point, the writers' names (Andrew or Sarah) were revealed, revealing that one was a man, the other a woman. Participants submitted a grade to each writer, as well as substantive comments to improve their essays.\n\nParticipants were more likely to tell white lies to the woman writer,  **inflating Sarah's grades nearly a full letter grade higher than from their initial private evaluation. They also gave her more positive comments than they gave Andrew. In contrast, the man's in-person feedback was statistically indistinguishable from the participants' undisclosed evaluations of his work.**\n\n**Please note:** When this study was reported, it was reported as being discrimination towards women as their performance was being upgraded and they weret being given correct feedback, rather than the more obvious statement, that men are being disrimnated against and women work is being marked up.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBoys 'being held back by women teachers' as gender stereotypes are reinforced in the classroom\n\n[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1307856/Boys-held-women-teachers-gender-stereotypes-reinforced-classroom.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1307856/Boys-held-women-teachers-gender-stereotypes-reinforced-classroom.html)\n\nChristian Hoff Sommers explains how boys are being punished for normal behaviours:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFpYj0E-yb4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFpYj0E-yb4)\n\nDo Schools discrimiante against boys: Dr. Jim Dueck, author, former Assistant Deputy Minister of Education for the province of Alberta, and former head of Accountability and Student Assessment, performed a revealing analysis on current practices in student assessment. The results were not only remarkable but very disturbing, exposing what might well be an institutional suppression of the performance of male students.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qloY4OJxBoQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qloY4OJxBoQ)\n\nRelated, despite a widely held view to the contrary, in a large scale national study, women are favoured 2:1 over IDENTICAL or even slightly more qualified men in STEM applicationss but gender BLIND helps men significantly, and the latter is now becoming less commonly applied as a result.\n\n[https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360)\n\nThis could go to explain why many prominent claims of discrimination have failed as there is a perceived bias but on investigation, this is proved false e.g. US womens football team equal pay claim led to the judge saying the women were paid more than men, or women suing Google only for Googles results to show they were paying mens less.\n\nFunding:\n\nFemales given $6 billion per year more in grants by government for education despite being the overwhelming majoirty in university\n\n[https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=13620&fbclid=IwAR1zxexkrfKy5VeGcW0IC-hUy6mgUMQS4F8di\\_Eyk3ZDt2jhMVgtTcX6WcA](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=13620&fbclid=IwAR1zxexkrfKy5VeGcW0IC-hUy6mgUMQS4F8di_Eyk3ZDt2jhMVgtTcX6WcA)\n\nThere are also 11 female only scholarships per 1 male one, with some universities have 100 female only scholarships and none for men, again despite men being a minority in university, and in alsmost all courses (even in STEM technically men are a minority, its only a few specfic subjects e.g. physics, computer science that men are a majority while women are a majority in Medicine, Biology, Nursing, Psychology, Veteniary Medicine etc)\n\n**At home (similar ins school):**\n\nBoys are more likely to receive corporal punishment from their parents then girls ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952896/)). They are also, in general, more likely to recieve severe verbal and physical punishment from both mothers and fathers ([source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227312033_Harsh_Discipline_and_Child_Problem_Behaviors_The_Roles_of_Positive_Parenting_and_Gender/link/55aeac6b08aed9b7dcdda4c0/download)). Some studies indicate the difference is less pronounced at the home and may be non-significant in the first years of infancy ([source](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/113/Supplement_5/1952.full.pdf)), but the difference is still present in the same direction as it is in schools for most of adolescence.\n\n**Can something be done? Of course:**\n\n[http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/sept06/vol64/num01/Teaching-to-the-Minds-of-Boys.aspx](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/sept06/vol64/num01/Teaching-to-the-Minds-of-Boys.aspx)\n\nThis school took a boy friendly approach. What was applied is explaied in detail. **Boys performance rocketed, gender gap went and girls performance went up nearly as much too.**Current system is bad for everyone but it just s happens it massively favours girls. I think it will get worse bad sterotypes about boys and now literally every other story about manspreading, mansplaining, toxic masculinty, menaretrash (real hashtag on twitter) all will not help. There is no political will... in the UK the head of uni admissions even said she thinks its a scandal no one is doing anything about plumetting uni levels for boys and if any other group it would be an outrage.... Uni of Arizona has 160 female only scholarships and 2 male ones despite women outnumbering men in almost every single degree... in the very few that they dont in STEM (not even all stem, for example more female medics, biology, vets) they are actively recruiting girls but doing nothing for boys\n\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/05/real-reasons-girls-outperforming-boys-school/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/05/real-reasons-girls-outperforming-boys-school/)\n\nTelegraph article on number of men in teaching, and techers openly admitting to sexism in favour of girls:\n\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html)\n\nI do know from my own direct experience that many young women of the 1960s and 1970s went into teaching inspired by a feminist mission to raise the self-esteem and the social position of girls. I could name at least half a dozen women teachers I knew personally in the later decades of the last century who were proud to say that they favoured girls in class to make up for the oppression of women in the past. The moral dubiety – and outright sexist prejudice - of inflicting second-class treatment on little boys who could bear no personal responsibility for those alleged (and profoundly questionable) historical crimes never seemed to trouble those apostles of equality. Men are hardly likely to become primary school teachers because they feel they owe a duty to their sex\n\nBy the same token, I can name a similar number of feminist commentators in the media/political establishment who celebrated the rise of educational attainments for girls in school as evidence that females are, by birth and nature, superior to males. As girls overtook boys in grades and exam results at all levels throughout the education system, those sisters were cock-a-hoop at their gender’s triumph – never acknowledging that the advantage of one sex must have been bought at the expense of the other. Not one Secretary of State for Education in the last 40 years has expressed concern that the [gender divide in academic achievement ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/11364130/Girls-do-better-than-boys-at-school-despite-inequality.html)reflected a worrying ethos in schools that imposed disadvantage and inequality on boys. They wouldn’t dare.\n\nAlong with the politicians, men, as a whole, simply gave in to this feminist-driven growth of inequality with the bovine supinity which has characterised their outlook for the last half century. Have you ever met a man who was fretting anxiously that his own son/s were being unfairly treated at school?",

    "text": "Hello! I exist and I'm proud to be a man! I hesitated in posting here, originally I was gonna reply, but I wanna take the soapbox, even though I've been a long follower and despite me speaking about men's issues for ages, I still kinda felt that... maybe I won't be accepted with my reply or is it a good look? And that, made me realize how essential it is for all of us dudes and not only to speak up about the issues men face these days! \n\nBasically... I've faced a lot of issues being a guy and specifically being a russian speaking gay guy. Like... I literally don't feel safe whenever I go back to see family and I've got plenty of stories from randos to police to back up, like you can literally choose many of my characteristics which just give people reason to pick a fight verbal or a fucking fine.\n\nI grew up in a household and everything where being a man was nearly equal to being a demon, due to the rad feminist ideology and seeing these days that everyone is erasing rad fem past in LGBT circles and et cetera is not just annoying me, but feels like another spit and slap in the face. \n\nI've lost many friends by coming out as a trans guy, by coming out as a gay guy. I'm also white which gets muddled up into \"never had slavery in ancestry, colonialist background and etc\". My ancestors were slaves. Why do I even have to bring receipts and I don't make a fuss out of it, I just mention it when people say that white people have no being slaves history.\n\nThe most difficult coming out of my life was as a gay man, because what's worse than one man? TWO men loving each other, of course! I was said that I am stealing myself from being a husband and my partner from a woman as well! \n\nHow dare I stop being an inspiration? (Sure, the nastiest quotes are from changed people as they had over 7 years to turn leaf, but still stings and I recall the first recations, not to mention the enormous amounts of blocks from close friends who didn't want to be friends with a trans guy or a guy alone and obviously that was that in the blocked numbers). \n\nI thought about this a lot and indeed... Why can't I have a proud dude shirt? Sure, I'd like some Tom of Finland dudes with my caption on some stationary, but in general I hate how everything has girl power on it with no alternative and even if you look at unisex fashion or anyone striding fashion it's always femme, femme is good and has a girl next to the guy. So is it really unisex and if you can find it in female sections? Why has men's fashion even gotten so rigid and it's like... maybe some dudes just wanna wear suits and others don't. We shouldn't judge. Men come in all shapes and sizes. What about goth brands? Why don't they have plus size??? What about make up ads? Why must we all have some hidden \"fem\" side to enjoy such things? I'll rewatch Fight Club and fight Brad Pitt anytime gladly with my nails dyed. I don't even know what examples I need. I just wanna be me and accepted everywhere without striding with caution. \n\nMe wearing my clothes, etc doesn't make me less of a man.\n\nAlso, someone posted in another thread that being trans or gay or some other ethnicity gives you a leeway to be proud, I thought on that and wanted to say... I'm just a guy. Then everything else comes later.",

    "text": "Black men matter Now before you read the title and downvote, let me clarify something. Yes, I know that the male experience is not exclusive to black men. I’m a white guy myself. But the hardest hit group by the modern war on men is almost certainly black men. Think about most of the issues that negatively affect men more than women: disproportionate sentencing, capital punishment, police brutality, fatherless homes, false rape accusations, homelessness, homicide, suicide... the list goes on and on. These issues, be they societal or legal, are often exacerbated for black men. Take sentencing disparities for example. In the US, 1 in 111 white women are in prison. Meanwhile, 1 in 17 white men are in prison. Pretty bad disparity, right? Now get this: 1 in 3 black men are in prison.\n\nWhat are the reasons for this? Well above all else, I’d say it’s all about being perceived as a threat. Men are more likely to be seen as threats than women. I think the fine folks here understand that well. For black men, this issue is once again exacerbated. Nothing pleases a racist, misandrist judge more than seeing a young black man being “taken off the streets” because he’s seen as a threat. And this perception also frequently manifests itself in the form of police homicide. It’s how a police officer can walk into a random, law-abiding citizen’s own apartment and [shoot him to death](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Botham_Jean) while he’s sitting on his couch because she thinks he’s an intruder. Btw, that police officer will be eligible for parole after just five years, and she’s currently appealing to have the murder charge dropped altogether. How’s that for “male privilege”?\n\nAnyway, the point of this post is not to create division. Once again, I think that white and black men both experience hardships due to our sex. And I’m not trying to imply that every woman is racist against black men, or misandrist as a whole. My point is just that we should be aware of the experiences of our black brothers, and stand with them as they battle racial inequality in addition to misandry.",

    "text": "When people hear I’m a MRA. (Warning: long post) When people hear I’m a MRA people think that Means I am a racist, sexist, bigoted and incel. I don’t believe that to be true for me or for anyone here. What I think MRA means is calling out what feminists believe to be true and to call out the bad things that they do in the guise of “social justice”. \n\nThe reason I joined MRA was because I began to understand the harm that feminism is doing on young boys and how it is just wrong that men are being treated unfairly in family court, school and society in general. I came to this realization in high school when I had a teacher give all of her attention to the girls in the class to help them succeed and punish the boys with extra homework and an unfair grading standard. I didn’t realize at first but later in the term I figured it out as it seemed that we had to do more work for no extra reward and it just seemed weird that my female classmates loved her but my male classmates and I absolutely HATED her. It came down to her projecting her home life on the students. I am now almost out of college so it was a long time since then but I still remember it like it was yesterday. \n\nIt is just shitty that women are allowed and encouraged to be sexist and racist and just down right psycho but if a man does any of that it is a crime in the public court. I just love reading tweets calling to “kill all men” or to “teach men to be better”. If I replaced man with woman I would be dragged all over the internet and my life would be absolutely ruined. I have seen it happen with many people even men I know. For example a friend, let’s call him John went to a party with some really popular girls and proceeded to hook up with one of them will call Jane. After the party Jane regretted sleeping with him and wished she didn’t. Her friends told her that she could claim it was rape and encouraged her to report him to the school. Luckily for John, she never went through with it as she knew that it was consensual. She told that to her friends and they said that if she didn’t report him, they would. First of all it is extremely inappropriate to tell someone what they want when it isn’t even true. So the friend who will call Amy told the school that John raped her friend Jane and she wanted to tell you but felt she couldn’t. Again, John got lucky that Jane told the school and the police that she didn’t say that and that John didn’t rape her and it was consensual. Why do I mention this? Because it is just one of the many ways that feminists hurt us guys and that it would be so wrong for a man to do. \n\nI simply don’t understand how people think that it is ok to be sexist to men and racist towards white people as if reverse racism isn’t real. It just sickens me to see society turn its back towards men. Judge not by the sex of the person but by the content of their character.",

    "text": "Huge feminist protests erupt across Caribbean island Trinidad and Tobago in light of the recent rape and murder of a 23-year-old girl, Andrea Bharatt. [https://www.newsamericasnow.com/caribbean-news-andrea-bharatt-murder-trinidad-and-tobago/](https://www.newsamericasnow.com/caribbean-news-andrea-bharatt-murder-trinidad-and-tobago/)\n\nTens of thousands of men and women are protesting against the government of Trindad to do something to improve the safety of our women. Dozens have gone missing and have most likely been raped and murdered.\n\nAfter the recent (Jan kidnapping, murder and suspected rape of Andrea Bharatt, enough is enough!\n\n[https://newsday.co.tt/2021/01/30/arima-woman-kidnapped-ransom-demanded/](https://newsday.co.tt/2021/01/30/arima-woman-kidnapped-ransom-demanded/)\n\n**She was an innocent sweet, university educated, 23-year-old girl who worked as a clerk at a Magistrates court.** She was was abducted in a 'fake taxi' on January 29th. After several massive manhunts, her body was eventually found 7 days later. From all accounts, she had been killed the same day she was taken.\n\n**About Trinidad -** The southernmost Caribbean Island and 3rd richest country in the Western Hemisphere per capita, the oil-rich Trinidad who invented Steelpan music, Soca and Calypso and has the world's second-biggest carnival, is no stranger to violence and crime.\n\nWe are a uniquely cosmopolitan island (40% Indian, 40% Black, 20% mixed/white/Venezuelan/Syrian) country of 1.5M people that has surprisingly little racial tension but has been plagued over the last 2 decades with increasing gang violence.\n\nHowever, despite having near 500 murders annually for the last 20 years (10,000 people murdered) one recent murder shook the nation to its core (after years of several women going missing or murdered/raped).\n\n**Andrea Bharatt was possibly raped, murder and then dumped over a ledge along a mountainous road in Aripo.**\n\nPolice were able to hold two suspects, one was found with her bank card who later sold out his accomplice.\n\n**The main suspect was well known to the police.** In fact, he had 70 charges and numerous criminal cases against him, yet for some reason, **he was not in jail.** On 5 occasions shoddy (or bribed) police work resulted in cases being dropped. Other cases were still pending, but judges saw it fit for some reason to grant him bail.\n\n**The lack of urgency, complacency, incompetence, corruption and ownership of these issues by authorities has ANGERED an entire nation, a nation where women are feeling increasingly unsafe.**\n\nIt has been met with silence, and politicking by the government who refuses to take responsibility and attempt to pass the blame.\n\nProtestors and feminists are taking to the streets to bring attention to this issue, but we need this to go international to pressure our government to take responsibility and weed out corruption.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe two suspects later died in police custody with the police claiming one 'fell off his chair' and the other got injured in an escape attempt.\n\nNo doubt police who were complicit in these guys not being in jail and were trying to shut them up,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**This is reminiscent of what happened in Delhi with the brutal bus gang rape in 2012.**\n\nHowever, we need your help. We have a condescending out of touch government that caters only to the needs of the richest in the island and not the average citizen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe victim - [https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2021/02/andrea-b2.jpg](https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2021/02/andrea-b2.jpg)\n\nA video project by the victim - [https://youtu.be/lqaJDOxfeFg](https://youtu.be/lqaJDOxfeFg)\n\nThe headlines - [https://scontent.fpos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/148357699\\_10158003590655814\\_4702965862099867631\\_o.jpg?\\_nc\\_cat=108&ccb=2&\\_nc\\_sid=730e14&\\_nc\\_ohc=OOPzySAt6sgAX\\_zfXSE&\\_nc\\_ht=scontent.fpos1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=6f657382c1bda4f7523dc0c0e170a079&oe=60483DD0](https://scontent.fpos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/148357699_10158003590655814_4702965862099867631_o.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=2&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_ohc=OOPzySAt6sgAX_zfXSE&_nc_ht=scontent.fpos1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=6f657382c1bda4f7523dc0c0e170a079&oe=60483DD0)\n\nThe essence of the government's response - [https://scontent.fpos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/147852653\\_10159315695791119\\_866468936050134841\\_o.jpg?\\_nc\\_cat=103&ccb=2&\\_nc\\_sid=730e14&\\_nc\\_ohc=LBTXQi4pP3QAX8aOWi9&\\_nc\\_ht=scontent.fpos1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=b11bf5728cd0266c4a99a6b505897f16&oe=604959CF](https://scontent.fpos1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/147852653_10159315695791119_866468936050134841_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=2&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_ohc=LBTXQi4pP3QAX8aOWi9&_nc_ht=scontent.fpos1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=b11bf5728cd0266c4a99a6b505897f16&oe=604959CF)\n\nVideo of our Government's nonchalance and condescending attitude here - [https://www.facebook.com/100001952421497/posts/5106469866094710/?sfnsn=wa](https://www.facebook.com/100001952421497/posts/5106469866094710/?sfnsn=wa)\n\nAll the women killed/missing over the last decade or so - [https://scontent.fpos1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/144741275\\_747508228171\\_652795971916147088\\_o.jpg?\\_nc\\_cat=105&ccb=2&\\_nc\\_sid=8bfeb9&\\_nc\\_ohc=WuQiiDTRauoAX\\_WtmhP&\\_nc\\_ht=scontent.fpos1-2.fna&oh=5e3cba222c8379d1a2e61bcd1df47fce&oe=60466014](https://scontent.fpos1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/144741275_747508228171_652795971916147088_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8bfeb9&_nc_ohc=WuQiiDTRauoAX_WtmhP&_nc_ht=scontent.fpos1-2.fna&oh=5e3cba222c8379d1a2e61bcd1df47fce&oe=60466014)\n\nPetition (one of many) - [https://www.change.org/p/minister-of-national-security-protect-our-women-in-t-t?recruiter=false&utm\\_source=share\\_petition&utm\\_medium=facebook&utm\\_campaign=psf\\_combo\\_share\\_initial&utm\\_term=psf\\_combo\\_share\\_abi&recruited\\_by\\_id=150ab800-67ce-11eb-a39e-db9fdf139296&utm\\_content=fht-27200205-en-gb%3A0](https://www.change.org/p/minister-of-national-security-protect-our-women-in-t-t?recruiter=false&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&utm_term=psf_combo_share_abi&recruited_by_id=150ab800-67ce-11eb-a39e-db9fdf139296&utm_content=fht-27200205-en-gb%3A0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe want this to go viral, this needs to reach CNN, MSNBC, BBC, even FOX or OAN (we really don't care at this point).",
