    "text": "Horrible interview yesterday that makes me realize companies are mislabeling jobs & leaving out massive requirements so they can wildly underpay, not to mention refuse to train. I interviewed for a \"coordinator\" role in a company in a major city yesterday that was very generic about data stewardship. I've done this in a similar company before - I'll admit, it's mostly data entry, electronic record keeping, research, administrative work within existing records, using ERP correctly. Stuff I have experience in. \n\n...*Every interview*, including this one, has become a horrible game of trick questions where the interviewer conceals the actual skill level required. Nothing about training. Extraordinary discrepancies between job description and specific requirements, like expert level Excel. \n\nSometimes they overshoot what is actually required. They go out of their way not only to give the impression there will be *no training within the job* to do the job, use the software, do the tasks they need a qualified candidate to do - I realized in this case the interviewer had lied about the actual responsibilities of the job. \n\nHe started asking me what I know about VBA, querying large data sets in Excel (if you guys have notes, I would be grateful - I've never done Power Query before, only basic functions, up to something like offset/match, tables.)\n\nIt's very hard to get that training, it seems, unless your fresh out of college - after internships. I only have a little as a contractor, and I was on my own, mostly, using what I've picked up in Excel workshops.\n\nWhen I pointed out it seems they're look for a sales analyst, the interviewer argued with me and said it was a different job. \n\n*This is the second time this has happened*, the second job, where I apply to my former job title...and find I have to talk about writing fucking Excel macros. Have to desperately, flabbergastedly talk about tutorials I've taken on querying large data sets with SQL. \n\nThis is for a job in a major American city that requires at least 3 days onsite and starts at $43k. It's not even the decline in pay...its the skills expectation for that salary and the horrible experience of being made to feel like I did something wrong when I just applied to an \"entry level\" opening that seemed to match my background. \n\nNo reporters are talking about this trend (not just my job search-shouldn't have to clarify that), but I don't think it's just me....it seems like there's a requirements/pay mismatch across more than a few white collar industries that got worse sometime in 2023, and I don't think I would believe this if I weren't going through it. NYT did a couple of articles on the Great Resignation....this seems comparable or like a reversal.\n\nIt's been a year of searching in a market that's gotten worse....last year was bad, this year is like a Twilight Zone nightmare of people asking for senior sales analysts under \"administrative assistant\" jobs. \n\nAnd that doesn't cover the jobs in tech where my interviews are 25 year old managers with theater/fashion degrees somehow working as financial managers who just...don't want to work with someone older than they are. \n\nEvery five years the job market gets worse and worse, and the skills requirements skyrocket. \n\nThat's a frightening prospect if you are in your 20s and coming into the job market for the first time, but if you are lifelong underemployed, like me, and have a shitty resume (a few years of  experience, but all for contract projects, or in dead end office jobs in horrible companies)...I'm at my wit's end. The stigma never really goes away barring something extraordinary, like a Master's degree...and even then, it's hopeless unless someone just...gives you a chance.\n\nNote, the only reason I applied to this job was because the job description actually seemed to match my background, or general enough I could have hope. Hiring for my previous job title and its actual duties has disappeared.\n\nI'm seeing jobs for sales analysts that want Salesforce certifications, 3 years of managing a companies' \"business processes\", Masters' etc. that start at $60k and tap out at $75k. \n\nIts really fucking bad out there, and not only am I afraid seeing salaries shrink while skill requirements for \"entry level\" jobs explode...I've never actually been trained in a single job I've ever done. Not really. Not to stay in a job, only as a contractor, and of course, that's short-lived and can't truly be practiced and built upon within that role. \n\nI've never enjoyed the normal experience of being taken on, trained, kept, and promoted because I didn't intern and came into the job market after I wasted a lot of time in grad school. It wasn't for lack of desire or work in those jobs. \n\n...And thus, even if I can work towards certifications, take Coursera courses, take tutorials by myself...none of really matters. It's all done alone, and it's not \"demonstrable experience\". It's unpaid labor with precious little direction to get to the first interview stage with people who treat my resume like a wad of used toilet paper anyway.\n\nSo much of what I'm seeing in job listings now points to a level of training you can't even do on your own without paying for a software license. Over and over. \n\nIs anyone else experiencing this or seeing this?",

    "text": "Company won't hire any minorities I am a white male who is an upper-middle manager at a regionally successful business in the Pacific Northwest (300+ employees on the payroll). After getting a graduate degree (combined with some Covid layoffs), I have been making strides at work and have received two promotions in the last four years. Approximately two weeks ago I got invited to be a member of a resume review board for selecting new interns and employees. This is the first time I have been a member of such a board.\n\nThings were pretty banal and repetitive at first until we arrived to a frankly over-qualified candidate who was African American. I voted that we bring this guy on but the other people I was on the board with disagreed. They said that they couldn't bring in any more African American employees until more diversity coordinators for the company were hired. I asked what the hell that had to do with anything and they said they didn't want to open up the company to \"liability for any lawsuits\" so they had to acquire more diversity resources before they could hire any minority candidates. The head of the board also stated that this directive came from the Owner/CEO. Completely disgusted, I stormed out of the meeting.\n\nThe head of HR was also a member of this meeting so I have no real avenue for filing a complaint other than via the Oregon BOLI. I have been completely socially isolated at work since this incident and anticipate I am on the verge of being fired. What do I do in this situation??",

    "text": "Am I being unreasonable for wanting to resign after finding out I don’t get real vacation days? I’m a religious Jew, and that means that throughout the year, on different days then American holidays, we have our own holidays which I’m not allowed to work on, according to the laws of my religion.\n\nWhen I first started working at my current job, there was a miscommunication, and from what I was told, I understood that for these holidays I’d be able to take off as unpaid days, without being written up for the absences. In reality, the actual company policy is that if I have any PTO days when a holiday comes around, I’m required to use them for that day. Only if I have no PTO left, can I still take off without pay, but not be written up. \n\nThe general company policy is also that (besides the above exemption) any absence for a day, even if I were to inform the manager of my absence even weeks in advance, would be a write up if I have no PTO left. There’s no such thing as taking unpaid days off in this company. \n\nNow, in total, there aren’t that many major Jewish holidays that I can’t work on and so I must take off work throughout the year, about 5-15 days depending on if it’s a lucky year when they fall out on a Saturday-Sunday, but still that’s enough to take away almost all, if not all, of my PTO, and that’s not even counting the minor holidays that Jewish law permits to work on, but recommends not to, that I wanted to save up on PTO so I don’t have to work those days (since they aren’t included in the exemption) \n\nAll of this basically means, that because I follow my religion, I will never be able to have a true vacation, which was a bit jarring to find out. (And no, the major Jewish holidays are not vacations. They are extremely busy, and filled with times of prayer, rituals, preparations for the rituals etc. in general, they are more stress filled then a regular work day. There are fun parts, and I genuinely do love them, but they are not vacations from anything.) \n\nI’ll never be able to visit family for an important event or for fun, I’ll never be able to take a day of to relax, and even for an emergency I’ll have to negotiate for a way to take off without getting fired, rather then simply using PTO like a regular employee. \n\nSo I’m thinking of resigning, and going to college full time instead, and negotiating a more favorable deal when I try to get a job after that.\n\nTo add a little, aside from this one thing, my boss and management in general are really nice and amazing. They often do promotions, I got a promotion after less then 3 months, and they give other bonuses and raises regularly. They are very tolerant of mistakes, and training was done very efficiently, and for many other stuff they are really good. Which is why I’m asking for advice here and not ranting on r/antiwork . It’s just this one thing that makes me feel sad. I’m not ready to be stuck in a job forever. I want to explore and be free to visit family, friends, and cool places. That’s why I started working in the first place, so if the job is not getting me that… should I stay?",

    "text": "Working for American Marketing & Publishing Dekalb IL (BEWARE) This review is for anyone considering working as a digital sales representative at American Marketing & Publishing!!! \n\nI left my previous stable job because I thought that working at AMP would be a better opportunity for me financially.  I started my job, and although outside sales is not for everyone, I found success in it and good experience. The typical day is exactly how they said it would be, and the training process was exceptional, giving great insight on the sales process and services/products. I felt comfortable doing outside sales because it was for an advertising agency with legit products and I graduated with my B.S in Marketing in 2022.\n\nThe red flags started when I received a fraud \"bonus check\" for \"winning a contest\" that I did not even know was going on. They are taking it out of my paycheck (my $700 paycheck for 2 weeks of work). This mistake by the company made them lose credibility in my eyes right off the bat.\n\nThe next issue that happened was that when I brought my concerns of my misleading compensation regarding my commission to my manager and she met my concern and confusion with gaslighting responses such as \"you are the only one who is confused\" \"that was very clear\" \"you missed that, we told you\". This was concerning to me because when you check other reviews on Glassdoor/Indeed/ Reddit, I find that I was not the only one who was mislead. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*This part is important\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*: I am not one to ever write reviews, but I made a reddit account just to get my word out there. This company offers \"reputation management\" as one of their services where they manage reviews for their customers. This feels slimy to me because most of the reviews that you read about this company on Glassdoor, Indeed, etc. are skewed. Please pay special attention to the reviews that have low ratings just as a general rule of thumb. \n\nOverall, the outside sales and their products were legit, but the company is scheme-ish when it comes to getting your paycheck and reputation management. Extremely misleading. If it seems too good to be true.....it is!",

    "text": "Is the job market really the worst in decades? A seemingly popular opinion on this subreddit and other job-related subreddits is that the current job market is among, if not the worst, in recent history (roughly the last 30 years according to some people). A few people have not hesitated in comparing this job market to The Global Financial Crisis of the mid 2000s. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16n5rar/thank\\_you\\_jerome\\_powell\\_for\\_creating\\_the\\_worst/](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16n5rar/thank_you_jerome_powell_for_creating_the_worst/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16mv8t2/am\\_i\\_just\\_crazy\\_or\\_is\\_this\\_the\\_worst\\_job\\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16mv8t2/am_i_just_crazy_or_is_this_the_worst_job_market/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/15h3yru/this\\_is\\_absolutely\\_the\\_trashiest\\_job\\_market\\_i](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/15h3yru/this_is_absolutely_the_trashiest_job_market_i/)[/](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/15h3yru/this_is_absolutely_the_trashiest_job_market_i/)\n\nThese are incredibly strong claims. Strong claims require strong evidence. My goal isn't to suggest that the job market is *good,* but simply that there isn't sufficient evidence to support these (again seemingly) popular claims. What counts as strong evidence? Not reddit posts about how you can't find a job with a Ph.D./Master's/20 years of experience. Let's rely on *generally trustworthy/representative*  institutions or data and/or associated inferences/interpretations. \n\nI'll first roughly define a \"bad\" job market. This is subjective, but a \"bad\" job market would be one that displays multiple significant *generally trusted* historical measures of poor job market indicators below historical averages. Note that I am intentionally avoiding the question of whether this is a \"good\" job market. \n\nSo, where do we go from here? Let's start with The Federal Reserve, arguably the most important job-related institution in the U.S. The Fed has two mandates. One of those mandates is *maximum employment.* [*https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary-policy-what-are-its-goals-how-does-it-work.htm*](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary-policy-what-are-its-goals-how-does-it-work.htm)*.* In short, The Fed is REQUIRED to try and promote employment among Americans. How does The Fed achieve their mandate? Generally speaking, QE and QT. AKA increasing/decreasing money supply and increasing/reducing interest rates. That information alone should be incredibly useful in determining why The Fed makes  certain decisions and The Fed has been under scrutiny because lawmakers (Sen. Warrren esp.) are worried that increasing the interest rates will lead to a rise in unemployment among Americans. Full employment is (arguably) under 5% unemployment rate [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fullemployment.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fullemployment.asp). Where are we at currently? 3.8%.\n\n**UNEMPLOYMENT RATE**\n\nMany people in this sub (and others) incorrectly assume that unemployment counts the number of people who are on unemployment. That is not what the unemployment measures. Here is what the unemployment rate measures. [https://www.bls.gov/cps/definitions.htm#ur](https://www.bls.gov/cps/definitions.htm#ur)\n\nHere is where unemployment currently stands:[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)\n\nUnderstandably, people complain about that measure of unemployment for a variety of reasons. Fortunately, BLS tracks other measures of unemployment. Check for yourself,[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?eid=4773&rid=50](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?eid=4773&rid=50), the measures are pretty decently correlated. \n\n**Labor Force Participation Rate**\n\nOkay, you're not convinced that unemployment rate is a good indicator of the job market. Understandably, you might look at labor participation rate and see that it has declined. But if you look at this trend, you probably see that older people (which comprise the majority of the working population) are working longer while younger people are participating less [https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm). There are a lot of potential explanations for this trend, but I'd say that it is *possibly* driven by older people working longer to afford retirement while younger people are going to college more-so than people in the past [https://www.statista.com/statistics/184260/educational-attainment-in-the-us/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/184260/educational-attainment-in-the-us/) (and delaying entering the workforce). Additional source: [https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm)\n\n**JOLTS**\n\n[**https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSJOL**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSJOL)**.**  This alone should be enough evidence of the job market (in my opinion) but some people say that most  job openings are fake based on a partially incorrect interpretation of this reference (and others) to a survey- [https://www.wsj.com/articles/that-plum-job-listing-may-just-be-a-ghost-3aafc794](https://www.wsj.com/articles/that-plum-job-listing-may-just-be-a-ghost-3aafc794). When you dive into the survey, there are several issues. 1. The \"survey\" mentioned in the study was of 1,000 hiring managers. Is this study representative? Who knows? 2. It doesn't *exactly* align. Managers listed multiple reasons. 3. Managers don't always know. Managers at my company, for example, have no clue my reasons for posting jobs and they may make assumptions. Additionally, it costs money to post a job. It costs money for people to click on your posting.  There have been *slight* declines in hirings YoY [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.t02.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.t02.htm), but also corresponding *slight* declines in quits [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.t04.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.t04.htm). \n\nWhat about layoffs? [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.t05.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.t05.htm). *Slight* increases, with construction and information (tech.) being higher than other industries. Can't companies just mask layoffs through firing, etc.? [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.t06.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.t06.htm). Maybe, but there isn't much evidence to support it. \n\n**Philly Fed Index** \n\nThis is much more controversial, but one indicator of economic health (of many) is the PFI (as I call it). [https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/regional-economic-analysis/mbos-2023-09](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/regional-economic-analysis/mbos-2023-09).\n\nOne of the questions this survey asks is   \n\n3. In the current quarter, to what degree have the following factors acted as constraints on capacity utilization?  48% of respondents indicated that Labor supply was a moderate to significant constraint to their business. This suggests that they can't fill jobs. \n\n**Labor Market Conditions Indicator** \n\nThe Kansas City Federal Reserve tracks 24 measures of labor market conditions using their  LMCI.  A positive value indicates that labor market conditions are above their  long-run average, while a negative value signifies that labor market  conditions are below their long-run average. The current value is .85, indicating that the labor market conditions are above their long-run average level. AKA not a bad market. \n\n[https://www.kansascityfed.org/data-and-trends/labor-market-conditions-indicators/](https://www.kansascityfed.org/data-and-trends/labor-market-conditions-indicators/)\n\n**Wages**\n\nI view wages as a separate issue here since my overall concern is with the availability of jobs and not whether they pay well. But I know that some people will complain that employers just don't want to pay and that available jobs are just shitty with wages not keeping pace with inflation. Total employer compensation costs per worker as of December 2022 was $42.48 per hour according to BLS.  \n\nMoreover, it isn't *exactly* true that wages haven't kept pace with inflation. \n\n[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1351276/wage-growth-vs-inflation-us/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1351276/wage-growth-vs-inflation-us/)\n\nEspecially since weekly earnings are near historic highs (inflation adjusted) [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881600Q](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881600Q) \n\n**Conclusions**\n\nAlthough there is some variance in where the indicators point, the data generally points to the notion that the job market is not bad. My personal opinion is that this is one of the best job markets in U.S. history. \n\nThere are certainly flaws in this post and I don't take much time to counter arguments against these points. Why not? Because most of the data point in one direction. \n\n&#x200B;",

    "text": "Has the American Work Culture influenced the rise in Mental Health Crisis? I (F25) worked for two lower-income, schools in my city. I was managed by a private company but worked as a mental health provider for two schools that needed extra support. Both were part-time and did not pay very well, but it was my passion and I really needed a job - after 5 months of being unemployed due to our move. At the end of the 2023 school year, I was given the shocking news that the schools no longer wanted to work with my company - meaning I just lost my job. It hurt at first especially because I got really close to the teachers, students, site manager, and even dean of students. Apparently, it came down to budget costs and the non-profit company wanting more donations to fund their business. A lot of bad management tactics were involved and I don't even know the half of it.\n\nIt makes me upset to think back to May when I was given two options: Relocate to a school hours away from where my husband and I lived - or resign. At the time, I didn't know what else to do and was only given a day to decide. That previous summer, we had just moved states for my husband's job and I couldn't do the same thing again - especially when my husband makes more income than I do. Logically, it made no sense to accept this relocation offer or even try to commute. So, I had to tell them no and I had to put in my notice. Which has now left me unemployed for exactly 4 months without any unemployment benefits. Is there nothing else to do in cases such as this one? Maybe I made the wrong call or maybe I should've done more, but it wasn't worth it for our situation. Work uses us up for less than what we are worth and then can just walk us out when we no longer serve any purpose.\n\nThat's only one example. I'd be open to discussing the influence that the American Work Culture has shaped and influenced our community today - even possibly affecting the mental health crisis? It's crazy to think that the number one question asked in an opening conversation is \"What do you do for a living\" - like why do we do this to each other? Why are we sizing each other up based on job success and money? Being unemployed is one of the most isolating experiences and often leads to depression. I feel for anyone else going through this too. You're not alone!\n\nEdit: It's a terrible system to think we get depressed in a job that sucks and depressed without a job. It's a lose-lose every single time.",

Out of everything, I only had 1 initial interview, 2 hiring managers who ghosted me, and 1 who changed their mind the last minute and canceled the initial interview with me the day before, 100+ rejections, and the rest don't even have updates so it's all basically up in the air. I'm mentally and emotionally exhausted and I try to keep going but it gets so frustrating. \n\nBack story : I moved to the US just recently from Asia, have been unemployed since last year while I waited for my work authorization. I spent almost 11 years at my last job so the hiring practices the last time I was looking for a job was different. I had a decent job back home at a very big company doing B2B sales, and had no problem getting sought out by recruiters because of my experience. \n\nNow I'm wondering if I would ever get hired here in America. I know what I am capable of but some days I end up second guessing myself. I feel like the longer I am unemployed, the more I'm losing my sharpness. Some days I barely recognize myself. I also feel so bad that my husband has to work to support me because I haven't found a job yet, and I have drained all my savings. He is a very good guy and doesn't really mind, but we're limited to doing a lot of things because we're single income and budget is tight. Sometimes I feel so useless. I'm really trying my best to take it one day at a time, but I feel like I'm slowly falling into depression and it's hard to shake off.\n\nI don't know if it's me. If I'm doing something wrong. If it's my race, my gender. My degree that's not from an American institution? Is it because I don't have an MBA? Or that I stuck too long at my old job? I don't know where I'm heading, it's just really exhausting. \n\nFor those of you who are in the same boat as I am, how do you hang on? What do you do when applying for jobs? \n\nFor those who are in the same situation but already found a job after hundreds of applications, how did you do it?

I've applied to 250 jobs, had less than 10 interviews, and no offers despite reaching several final rounds. Recruiters have been rude and dismissive. Five years ago, I wouldn't have tolerated this, but now I'm desperate for work.\n\nI had a perfect interview at a dream company, made it to the final round, but didn't get the job. They probably didn't even fill the position. Now, I have an interview for a role that pays half of what I used to make. I'm angry and frustrated. I worked hard, did internships, climbed the ladder, and now it seems worthless. I'm more qualified than my former bosses, but now, there's nothing out there, not just for me, but for many. The economy is supposedly great, but the job market is terrible. Inflation is skyrocketing, wages aren't increasing, and people are struggling in every industry.\n\nSeven months in, I'm losing motivation. There are no jobs. I've tried everything - LinkedIn, resume revamping - but it feels like a lottery. I stayed in a job-rich area during the pandemic, but it's not helping. I watch less capable colleagues keep their jobs while I'm out. The whole situation feels like a façade. Economics seems as predictive as astrology.\n\nI can't even discuss this with my spouse without being told I'm not special, that everyone is going through this. But how can I not take this personally? What more can I do? It's like playing the lottery. I feel trapped and suffocated. The 'American Dream' feels like a cruel joke. We can't afford a family or a house. The future looks bleak.\n\nOur parents' generation doesn't understand. They say, \"You always find the money,\" but they don't realize the financial realities we face. There's no inheritance to hope for, just taxes and debts. Friends focus on global issues, but how can we care about the world when we can't even feed ourselves?\n\nWe're all just a few missed paychecks away from homelessness, which is everywhere. Despite trying to stay positive, everything feels grim. Employment masked the terrifying reality that one stroke of bad luck can ruin everything. I'm exhausted, and if I had more energy, I might hurt myself just to feel something different. But I don't even have the energy for that.",

    "text": "I am an experienced resume writer and editor, and wanted to share some pointers on how to best format your resume [PART 2] Hey r/jobs, it's me again, coming at you with all of the resume advice you could ever need, and more! I posted all of my resume tips and tricks a couple of months back, which led me to receiving an amazingly overwhelming amount of comments (THANK YOU!) and I wanted to clear up some things, and include some things I missed in my last post. I've put all of this advice in order so it's easy to find the info you need when you need it.\n\nTo introduce myself, my name is Holly, and I am an experienced resume writer and editor located in North America. Essentially, I love helping people make their resume the best it can be, and I often help out in the r/jobs discord, and a tech workers slack channel, giving free advice as often as I am able to.\n\nResume writing and editing has been a part time hobby/job for me since 2017. I work full time as a senior account manager in tech, plus I have a bunch of hobbies outside of work, so I give my time where I can, which is unfortunately not as much as it used to be. I guess that's why I've written these posts, because I can no longer help as many people as I used to, and hopefully this way it can assist hundreds or even thousands of people!\n\n***DISCLAIMER: Many of these tips are North America specific,*** ***and some/many don't apply to creative fields like designers/marketing resumes.*** *Also some of these are for people working in the corporate world and don't apply to food service or retail jobs.* ***Of course, some of these won't apply to you specifically, so use your common sense to take what is useful to you.***\n\n~\n\n# CONTACT INFORMATION AND TOP OF PAGE\n\n* **Contact details** \\- at the top when of your resume under or next to your name, you need to include the following things: your location (if you're willing to relocate to the area the job is in, put the jobs city in and not your current location) email address, and your LinkedIn profile. Phone number isn't essential, so include it or don't, it's fine. Other optional things to include - if you have a portfolio or GitHub, definitely include them. Don't paste them as a messy link, instead write \"GitHub\" and turn it into a hyperlink.\n* **Location:** Are you located in San Francisco, California, applying to jobs in your city, and/or remote? Write \"San Francisco, CA\".\n* **Location:** Are you in San Fran, but open to relocation, AT THEIR EXPENSE? Write \"San Francisco, CA (open to relocation)\".\n* **Location:** Are you in San Francisco currently, but you're willing to move **before** starting a new job to New York AT YOUR OWN EXPENSE, where your dream job is located? Or you've already planned to move to New York and you're only applying to roles there? Put your location as \"New York, NY\". Why? Because you're moving there on your own cost prior to starting work, at your own expense.  If it comes up in the interview, tell them the truth. \"This is my dream job and I'm planning to move prior to starting if I'm successful\", or \"I'm moving to New York on X-date - which is prior to the start date of this job - and everything is already organized, which is why I have my location listed as New York rather than San Francisco.\"\n   * If you want them to pay for your relocation fees, then use the (open to relocation) that I wrote above.\n* **DO NOT INCLUDE YOUR FULL ADDRESS IF YOU'RE IN NORTH AMERICA** \\- only include your City and State/Province, and use one of the above depending on your circumstances.\n* **Contact details (what not to include)** \\- don't include the word PHONE before your phone number, or EMAIL before your email address. They are not necessary. People know what a phone and email look like. You're just taking up space for no reason. Also don't include your social media accounts except for LinkedIn (unless they are professional accounts for marketing/design/media positions of course, etc.).\n* **LinkedIn link and info:** Make sure your LinkedIn profile link is customized. You can get a custom LinkedIn link from your LinkedIn profile on the right hand side at the top right, click on \"Edit public profile and URL\". Make sure your custom LI link includes your name and not just a bunch of random numbers. Be creative. Are you a John Smith and you're located in Texas? Maybe your custom link could be smith.john.tx or johnsmith.tx, or include your middle initial. Play around with it until you get the perfect LI custom link. When including your LinkedIn link on your profile, instead of including the whole URL, only include the last bit (for example, **in/johnsmith**) - and lastly, make sure you include the hyperlink on your resume so that people can click it while viewing your resume.\n* Do the same as above with GitHub or any other professional links you're including on your resume. Make it a hyperlink so you're not including some messy link that's killing the \"feng shui\" of your resume.\n* **DO NOT INCLUDE A PHOTO OF YOURSELF IF YOU'RE APPLYING TO JOBS IN NORTH AMERICA.** Companies have to prove that their hiring processes isn't based on race, gender, age, appearance, etc. Including a picture in NA can actually get your resume thrown out entirely. I know LinkedIn profiles include your profile picture, which is weird that we're just okay with this, but not with pictures on resumes, but here we are. Hey, I don't make up the rules, I merely abide by them and am here to ensure your resume is, *\\*chefs kiss\\**, perfectly formatted.\n* **Summary/Objective - to add or not to add?** I only recommend adding one if you're making a career move/change, and applying for jobs that aren't in your career ladder. The other alternative is if you've been out of your industry for a while, either studying or working in a completely different field, or if you took a break and need to explain the gap in work. I believe a summary should be no longer than 5 lines of the page maximum, which is typically around 3-4 sentences. You don't need a summary if you're looking for jobs on your current career ladder and don't have any gaps on your resume.\n\n# HOW TO ORGANIZE YOUR RESUME (IN ORDER)\n\n* If you HAVE had relevant experience since your education, then put your professional experience first. DO NOT INCLUDE YOUR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION (unless you're still in high school, or are looking for your first or second job out of highschool, or if you don't have university to add to it and you have less than 2 years of work experience). So it would go like:\n   * (1.) Name and contact info, LinkedIn, GitHub etc. 2. Summary/objective (if adding it) 3. Experience 4. Education & Certifications 5. Projects (if you have any you want to add, and the space to add them, or simply link to your GitHub or LinkedIn and list them there) 6. Skills 7. Volunteering - if it's going to assist with your current career, or if you have the space for it 8. Languages spoken (only add this if you speak more than one language fluently) 9. Interests (if you have the space and want to add them)\n* If you HAVEN'T had relevant experience and your education was in the past 1-3 years and it's relevant to your job, then:\n   * (1.) Name and contact info, LinkedIn, GitHub etc. 2. Summary/objective (if adding it - I do recommend it here to explain the direction you're heading) 3. Education & Certifications 4. Projects (if you have any) 5. Skills 6. Volunteering (if you have any) 7. Languages spoken (only add this if you speak more than one language fluently) 8. Interests\n* Basically, just put the best most recent and relevant info at the top that relates to the jobs you're applying to, and mark it in order from there.\n\n# ONE PAGE OR TWO?\n\nAh I love this question, people get so heated about it haha! There's a lot of variables and a lot of opinions on this, so let's get into it...\n\n* FIRST THINGS FIRST - If you're going to go to 2 pages, for the love of the flying spaghetti monster, DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT have it as less than 1.5 pages. If you're commiting to 2 pages, USE THE SECOND PAGE. Beef up some bullet points, make some of the text or the lines larger, whatever you need to do if you're absolutely convinced it will not fit on one page. Otherwise, REDUCE that bad boy to 1 page. Nothing quite grinds my gears as much as seeing an 8th of the second page being used. IT LOOKS AWFUL, REALLY REALLY AWFUL. Thanks for letting me get that off my chest.\n* Unless you're in senior management, your resume (for North American applicants anyway) should be one page ideally, two pages max if you have over 10 years of RELEVANT experience, but in saying that...\n* Do you have LESS than 10 years of university and work experience combined, and you're NOT in a high up VP/Director position? You are likely best to go with one page.\n* No education after highschool, but you've got 10 years or less of really amazing experience, but not in a higher up position? You are likely best to go with one page.\n* Do you have LESS than 10 years of university and work experience combined but you also have a few AMAZING projects you worked on separately, and you've done relevant volunteer work, and your resume is actually kind of incredible? Then hell yeah, go for 2 pages! Brag all you want and show them why they need to hire you!\n* I could go on. Just one page or two, either way, ensure you use the full page if you've got it, I hate seeing only 1.5 pages or less. Either bring it closer to 2, or bring it down to 1.\n* **\"What about 3 pages, or 4, or 5? I have so many jobs and I'm awesome and want to show them!\" In North America, NO, GET OUT OF HERE, ABSOLUTELY NOT!** They won't see it as \"Wow this person is amazing\", they will see it as \"Oh wow this person doesn't know how to write a resume, and this is way too long for me to bother to read\" and they'll delete it. In other parts of the world? Sure. I know some countries like the UK for instance that want a full CV (they are different from resumes, as they list every single job, achievement, certification, volunteer experience, and more) that are often 3+ pages long. Well, my advice isn't for UK resumes, because that's not my specialty. I'm just saying that 2 is the max for North America.\n* Need to find extra space on your resume to reduce it down to 1 or 2 pages? **Use narrow margins.**\n* **SO ONE PAGE OR TWO?** Honestly, either is fine if you're using the space efficiently, and aren't writing giant bullet points and paragraphs. ***If you're unsure, go for one page.***\n\n# GENERAL FORMATTING\n\n* **Make sure EVERYTHING is uniform**. If most of your dates are 3 letters only, like Jun 2016 - Oct 2020, then they ALL need to be the same. Yes, even the months of June and July with just one more letter. It looks much neater. Ensure you double check the spacing is correct too, for example, the most common error I see on resumes is some dates having a space and then a hyphen, and then no space before the next date (example Jan 2019 -Jun 2020 and then Jul 2020-Feb 2022, then Apr 2022 - Present) - this is a very small issue, but it shows you do not have attention to detail. Whichever format you choose for one, ensure they ALL follow the same format.\n* Double check if something is bolded, or underlined (like a title or date or company name), ensure that all the others are in the same format.\n* Is the font the same for each section? It's fine if you're using different fonts on your resume, but ensure that each section is the same. For example, if one job with all the bullet points are Times New Roman, then all jobs needs to be in Times New Roman. If one section header is Garamond, and the next section header is Times New Roman, it shows you don't have the attention to detail.\n* **Remember, your resume needs to be PERFECT. You seriously need to go through each line by line with a fine tooth comb.** Imagine not securing an interview with your dream job because of a few silly spelling mistakes or poor formatting. \"Well I didn't want that job anyway\"... yeah you did. It can be a hard pill to swallow and it's easy to make light of it, but you never know who is the one deciding on the yes or no pile and where yours will land.\n* **Ensure all line breaks are the same size**. If one blank line in between 2 paragraphs is size 7, and then the next blank line between paragraphs is size 11, it's a very noticeable detail to those looking at your resume.\n* **For your paragraphs and bullet points, use the \"justify\" align**. It removes a bit of the white space and brings your text fully to the right of the page. It's much neater and removes the jagged look of left align. The exception to this (as there usually are) is if none of your bullet points are longer than one line. I like justify align on a summary/objective if you're adding one, and on bullet points or any paragraphs that are 2 lines or longer. Play around with it and see what works best for your resume.\n* **DON'T WASTE AN ENTIRE LINE ON A HANDFUL OF WORDS!** I often see people when writing their bullet points taking up less than half a line, or only a couple of words on the 2nd or 3rd line. Not only does this create a lot of white space, but it's also selling yourself short. You have one, maybe two pages to sell the sh!t out of yourself. Make every single line of your page count. Make sure every single line of your bullet points is at least halfway across the page or more. Either beef up that bullet point, or condense it.\n* **5 bullet points max per job** (of course there are exceptions, but this is as a general rule). The older the job, the less bullet points. A job from 10 years ago will only require 1-3 bullet points (and only if it's relevant to your current career. Really think hard about whether to include it on your resume or not. Remember, all your jobs are on LinkedIn, not everything needs to go on your resume... again, North American advice).\n* **Use a different verb at the start of each bullet point.** I roll my eyes when I see the same word repeated multiple times as the first word in bullet points. Instead of just using the word managed, use words like Coordinated / Directed / Orchestrated / Oversaw / Spearheaded. There's a great article written by the Muse, you can find it here: [https://www.themuse.com/advice/185-powerful-verbs-that-will-make-your-resume-awesome](https://www.themuse.com/advice/185-powerful-verbs-that-will-make-your-resume-awesome). If you work in a field with specific wording, like Nursing for example, then google \"Nursing resume verbs\" or something like that. Put the work in to your research for your resume wording and you'll reap the rewards.\n* **DO NOT USE COLUMNS** (unless you're in a creative field like a designer, or your resume is being handed to someone in person) - Columns do not play nicely with ATS (AI resume reading software) and as the majority of companies now rely on ATS to quickly read resumes, you're shooting yourself in the foot by using columns or any other weird formatting.\n* Each bullet point should not be paragraphs long. Each bullet point should be 1-2 lines long only on the page, 3 maximum.\n* Each job should take up no more than 1/4 of the page, unless you've only had one or two jobs, or are more senior. Or in another unit of measurement, no more than 11 or 12 lines of the page. The more recent the role, and the more impressive the tasks, the more bullet points there should be, but don't just include the job description which leads me onto my next point...\n* Reiterating that each job should only include the achievements from that job, and only the most impressive things you achieved should be listed. Include KPIs, processes you implemented, articles you wrote, dollar amounts of your biggest sales or averages, include numbers of accounts you managed, or how many calls you took each day, if you went over your OTE what was the percentage, etc. It shouldn't read as a job description, you need to sell yourself and show them what you're capable of! (disclaimer - unless your jobs are more entry level or food service etc, then job descriptions are likely the norm).\n* Don't include irrelevant jobs/projects. If you worked at Starbucks for 6 months 5 years back, and you've had relevant experience in your field after that, then remove the Starbucks (or whatever other unrelated jobs you have) from your resume. Your resume should be tailored to the jobs you're applying for! To give you some more reference, I have been working since 2003, and my resume only has jobs from 2014 onwards.\n* **Try to have your dates on the right hand side of the page, and your position and company on the left (list the position first, then the company next to it or below it).** It's the standard, and makes the person reading your resume find the info much more quickly. Trying to make your resume too unique (again, unless you have a creative job then ignore this) will only hurt your chances of it being taken seriously. Of course you want to make it look nice, but try to follow the standard format where possible so it's easy to read.\n\n# SKILLS & INTERESTS\n\n* **Put your technical/software/program skills in one line**, separated by commas or | lines | like | these. Putting a single skill on each line is a waste of space, and will create too much white space. Your resume should be concise, to the point and get everything across in as little space as possible.\n* **Don't use the \"slider\" scales for your proficiency in various skills.** Why? Well, firstly, if the hiring manager wants to know your level in each, they will ask. And secondly, the dots or slider scales aren't measurable and take up extra wasted space that again is not going work well with ATS. Instead, as I mentioned above, list your skills and programs/software etc. in a line separated by commas | or | these | lines. Don't include software that you used 10 years ago and never progressed past a beginner level, but list pretty much everything else within reason. Most things you'll pick back up quickly even if it was 5 years ago, provided you were semi-decent with your knowledge of it.\n* What about interpersonal skills? Should you add them? I highly recommend adding them into your bullet points, rather than listing them separately. In saying that, though, there's going to be some industries, or some skills, that require them listed separately. If you're listing them separately, first ensure that you actually need them on the resume, and which ones are necessary and which ones can be removed if any. If you're still adament you want to list them separately, then put them in the same format as your technical/software skills as I listed above, either separating each with the | lines | like | these, or with commas, one on line. And that line needs to go below the hard/tech/software skills, not before, and ideally not together.\n* **Languages:** In North America, only list a languages section if you speak more than one language. Always list English first as this is a job requirement every time, and then other languages after that. If you're fluent in English, a native in Spanish, fluent in French, and have intermediate German, I would list it as such:\n   * \"Languages: Fluent in English, Spanish and French, intermediate in German.\"\n* **Interests - should you add them or not?** It's a highly debated topic and everyone will have a different view on this. I personally believe that you should include them. For example, I ride motorcycles and love stand up comedy shows, am coffee obsessed and love my local lacrosse team. Almost every single interview I land, my interests are brought up, with the interviewer connecting with one or more of my interests, or asking me more about them. It's a great conversation starter, and it makes you more than just an applicant, they will remember you as the person who they discussed their favourite sports team with, or the person who recommended them an amazing cafe that they've now added to their list. INTERESTS WILL MAKE YOU STAND OUT, I guarantee it. **Obviously, it can be negative depending on what you write, so be REALLY selective of what you include in your interests** (for example, don't include things like Anime or Manga, or the shooting range, or reading Holocaust novels, or your weapons collection, or anything political or religious, or anything you don't want to discuss during an interview - KEEP IT LIGHTHEARTED). I would make your interests 1 or 2 lines maximum on your resume, and don't go into detail (just list them out - for example, my interests on my resume are listed as \"Interests: Motorcycles, Warriors lacrosse, console and PC games, comedy shows, arcades, & searching for the perfect espresso.\") So basically, include them if you want, but if you do include them, make sure they aren't negative or controversial topics if it's brought up in an interview.\n\n# AVOID COMMON MISTAKES\n\n* \"References available upon request\" or adding references to your resume, is a BIG no no for North American resumes. Why? Because 1. it's assumed that you have references available on request, so including that is unnecessary, and 2. You don't want the company contacting your references if you've listed them, PRIOR to letting your bosses know, which is usually after you've received an offer, and 3. You don't want your references, whom have so kindly agreed to be one for you, getting inundated with calls or emails from the companies you're applying to, prior to the offer stage. Imagine applying to 50 companies, and all 50 call your references. Ouch. They won't be your reference for much longer.\n* Is your job across two pages? Nope, that's not going to work! I hate when I see a jobs bullet points going onto the next page. In my opinion, it's messy and just says \"poor formatting\".\n* **DO NOT MAKE YOUR RESUME TOO FLASHY! STOP WITH THE COLOURED TEXT!!** (this applies to non-design resumes only) Black text ONLY, with the exception of your name, contact information and section headers. You can put those in a colour other than black for a tiny bit of a \"pop\", but nothing overly in your face like red or bright pink. I personally use a dark blue, or dark green, or dark purple for the contact info and headers - DO NOT USE LIGHT COLOURS if you're going to use any at all. But objective/experience/skills/education etc, all the actual sections (not section headers) must be black text ONLY.\n* You absolutely should not have any images, and there should NOT be any background colour or background images whatsoever.\n* Do not use tables on your resume. That won't pass ATS and it looks pretty bad honestly.\n* Don't include a paragraph at the end along the lines of \"thanks for your time, please call me on 555-123-4567 if you have any questions or would like to set up an interview\". This isn't a cover letter. And even if it was, don't include your phone numebr or email in the cover letter body, that should be included with your contact details at the top of your cover letter, which should match the same format of your resume.\n* If you're going onto a second page, include the exact same name and contact information format as you have on your first (and other pages if outside of the US where more than 2 pages is common).\n\n# FINAL STEPS - SENDING YOUR RESUME\n\n* **NAMING YOUR RESUME:** And I'm not talking about naming him Resume McResumeface. Your resume name should be \"Firstname Lastname Resume\". Don't include the job title on there, or any periods, underscores, or any other information. \"J\\_Smith Customer Support Rep. Resume V2 Final\" is everything wrong with a resume title. I hear you asking, \"But holly948, how do I have multiple resumes then for the different jobs I'm applying to?\".\n* **ALWAYS SEND YOUR RESUME AS A PDF DOCUMENT!!** If you send it through as a Word document, their computer could mess with the formatting and it could ruin the perfect look of your resume. PDF will ensure they view it exactly how you have designed it to look. Sending through as a Word doc could ruin all of the hard work you put into the formatting. Devastating!\n\n# COVER LETTERS\n\nI'm sorry that's not my area, and I loath cover letters with a passion. Write them or don't, whatever. I personally never write cover letters as I find they are a waste of my time.\n\n# AKSHUALLY...\n\nLastly, I hear many of you about to furiously get into the comments with \"but my experience was...\" and \"in my opinion, you should...\", and \"actually, I think...\" and I get it! There is no \"one perfect way\" and everyone has different opinions. **This entire write up is in MY opinion and MY experience.** I'm not saying don't comment, just, please take this post as my opinion rather than \"it must be done exactly how I say or else you're never getting a job and your resume sucks\". Do whatever you want, man. Different things work for different companies and industries. This is my own general advice, and I know with resumes there is no \"one size fits all\". No two resumes I do are the same, because it comes down to the individuals experience, education, interests, what they're applying to and so many other factors. I'm just giving free advice from my own experience, in my own opinion, to serve the majority of people updating their resumes (primarily in North America).\n\n\\~\n\n**TL;DR** \\- **if you want to improve your resume, then I've given you everything you need minus the template.** **However, I'm doing up a template at the moment, and will share with you all, hopefully this weekend.** I want to give you all of the tools you need to succeed.\n\n*Enjoyed my advice from this post and/or the last? You can buy me a coffee!* [*https://www.buymeacoffee.com/holly948*](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/holly948)\n\nI sincerely hope this has helped, and I wish you all the best of luck in your job searches!",

I've tried for years, I've done everything people told me to do, and I have nothing at all to show for it I'm angry. I'm tired. I'm getting extremely frustrated. I've finished my daily limbo of applying for IT jobs that is as mundane and soul-crushing as it has been for the whole of 2022 and the start of 2023 as I write this as an angry cry for help:\n\n**What have I been doing wrong all these years?**\n\n[Here is my resume:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eUIt0yIvUfG5tIi2v8syp5IBOq19D4te/view?usp=sharing)\n\nI have plenty of basic IT knowledge and have the following skills:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Windows Active Directory\n* Group Policy and Management\n* WSUS\n* Performance Monitoring\n* Computer Networking\n* Computer Imaging/Reimaging/Clean Operating Systems Installations\n* Help Desk Documentation\n* IT Ticketing Systems (ServiceNow)\n* Programming\n* CMD and PowerShell\n* Virtualization\n* Hardware/Software Troubleshooting\n* Web Development\n* Database Programming\n* PC Assembly/Disassembly/ Interior Maintenance/Parts Replacement/Diagnosis/Troubleshooting\n* Hardware/Software Maintenance\n* Communication\n* Leadership\n* Project Management\n* Teamwork\n* Customer Service\n* Microsoft Office Suite (All programs with 10+ years experience\n* Analysis Skills\n* Problem Solving\n\nAnd I have the following experience in these Operating Systems/programming language (my programming language knowledge however is basic)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Windows XP/7/8/10\n* Windows Server 2016\n* MacOS\n* iOS/Android\n* Red Hat Linux\n* Kali Linux\n* SQL\n* Java\n* Python\n* JavaScript\n* Apple Swift\n* HMTL5/CSS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also have tons of references from managers, colleagues, professors, co-workers who all speak highly of me and are on my resume. I have an Associate's Degree in IT. I have applied for so many jobs over the last year that I have lost count, along with hundreds of IT jobs in the last 4 years. I'll be 30 in 2 days.\n\nI wasn't getting interviews, but now I'm getting interviews, but ALWAYS being PASSED OVER for someone else. It's infuriating. The last job my recruiter tried getting me, NOBODY got hired out of 10 candidates. I also am fairly certain I am doing well in my interviews. I am confident, I give good posture, I wear nice clothes, style my hair properly to loom professional, have good hygiene, trim my facial hair to be neat and presentable, answer their technical questions and personal questions with not talking too much but giving a good amount of detail to the question and always try to demonstrate my intelligence and education.\n\nI don't have any real work experience though that these stupid American companies find desirable. The only thing I have is the stuff I did for my 2 year Associate's Degree in community college, the 4 years of volunteer IT work at my Australian community college, 1 year at Teletech as help desk support, and 3+ years of working as an IT person for a mom-and-pop mechanic shop where I set up their computer/network and do their IT maintenance for them while they pay me in cash for the hours I work (it's basically under the table contract work, but the manager vouches my work as a great reference).\n\nI also don't have a Bachelor's Degree (yet) as I have applied for University and am hopefully getting a Bachelor's in Information Systems (I don't like Computer Science) with a second major in Japanese studies/the language during the next 3-4 years.\n\nThe other thing that pains me and infuriates me when people bring it up is I have permanent facial palsy, so I do have a speech impediment, however my speech is understandable and I have had years of speech therapy as a child. Technically yes I am disabled, and have been living off SSI for the last 4 years which was a terrible mistake, and I am trying to get off of it with a proper IT job. I've also been discriminated not only for my disability, but my race as well (I'm Southeast Asian/Thai) although I've never been able to sue for it due to lack of incriminating evidence that would be acceptable in court.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the experience I have:\n\nComputer Technician (3+ years) for mechanic shop:\n\n\\-Built and installed main office computer along with hardware/software maintenance and troubleshooting.- Installed modem, routers, set up 2.4Ghz/5Ghz Wi-Fi and Ethernet network while configuring and diagnosing network issues.- Set up system administration.

Most of the stuff you see on here are taken from my resume and LinkedIn. It also gets noticed daily by people and I get messages from recruiters offering me job applications in IT.\n\nAlong with all of this, I constantly self-study, am always learning and updating my knowledge on technology and what's new/evolving, constantly trying to improve my knowledge and experience with learning new skills, and am studying to get my COMPTIA A+ certification.\n\nAnd despite all of this... **I still have not gotten a goddamn IT job. I've wasted so much of my life trying to get my foot into this god-forsaken field but nobody will hire me for an entry-level position when I feel I am CLEARLY qualified to perform the tasks and learn to improve my IT knowledge and experience. It's a catch-22 with this field. I need the experience to get the job, but I need the JOB to GET the experience (especially since no internship has taken me). I've never gotten a single internship or job offer as I was always passed over FOR SOMEONE ELSE.**\n\nI've built computers from scratch at home and at college, I've fixed broken computers and laptops, I've replaced parts, installed operating systems, changed operating systems, programmed basic software applications, designed websites, done ticketing systems, monitored performance on computers/networks, written into knowledge bases online and have documentation experience, led a real life IT project in college for a museum, trained myself to use Windows servers at home by virtualizing 3-4 servers and desktops with VMWare so I could learn Windows Server 2016 and Active Directory, I've taken proficiency and assessments tests on recruitment websites and took them until I got a high score to impress interviewers, I've set up my own networks and other people's networks, routers, printers, etc.\n\nI've used so many job search websites: Indeed, LinkedIn, Monster, DICE, SimplyHired, ZipRecruiter, as well as applying to HUNDREDS of company websites and recruitment agencies. NOTHING but interviews and that's it, or not even hearing from them, or the most insulting: A damn automated message saying \"They're going with other people\".\n\nI get good feedback from people and constructive criticism on how to improve my interview skills from recruiters and have had years of interview experience. YEARS.\n\nWhat the hell am I doing wrong? I've followed everyone's advice and have gotten **NOWHERE.** What am I supposed to do to get into this field?! My career has been meaningless because it has never taken off. At this point, I have a better chance of getting better at digital art and somehow making money off that than getting an IT job and starting my IT career...\n\nTell me what I'm supposed to do to get an IT job and start my IT career when **The United States of America does not want to hire me for a single IT job let alone an entry-level one**",

Former policewoman Luana Radu is alleged to have been the contact**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe investigation into the case of brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, who are in pre-trial detention after being charged with human trafficking and rape, has also brought to light possible abuses committed by some Voluntari police officers. They allegedly tried to persuade at least one victim of the Tate brothers and their two female accomplices to drop the charges.\n\nThe arrest of the two Britons has raised questions about how, from 2016 until the end of 2022, they managed to raise millions of euros from the sexual exploitation of young women without ever getting into trouble with the law, especially in the context of the human trafficking charges brought by DIICOT prosecutors in December, when they also arrested them.\n\nJudicial sources revealed to Gândul that the Tate brothers did in fact get into trouble with the law, but were allegedly helped by some Voluntari police workers.\n\nIn this sense, it would be an incident that took place before the first searches in April 2022, when the villa of brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, in Pipera, was raided by the police of Ilfoveni, mobilized after a referral from the US Embassy. At the time, the diplomatic staff informed the police that a young woman, an American citizen, had been lured to Romania and kidnapped in a villa in Pipera, where an attempt was being made to sexually exploit her in a videochat studio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The case was closed**\n\nDuring the investigation, which reached DIICOT shortly after the April 2022 searches, prosecutors established that at least one woman had gone to Voluntari police headquarters to complain that she had been kidnapped in the building where the Tate brothers' videochat studio was set up, and had been beaten there by former police officer Luana Alexandra Radu and Georgiana Naghel.\n\nThe victim allegedly managed to escape from the videochat studio to the Voluntari police, where she filed a complaint.\n\nAccording to the sources cited, the police officer who recorded her complaint would then also have called Luana Alexandra Radu to the Voluntari Police headquarters, where he would have recommended her as his \"former colleague\".\n\nThe policeman allegedly insisted that the woman complaining that she had been kidnapped and assaulted drop the charges. Subsequently, sources say, the case was closed by the investigators of Ilfoveni.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Britons Andrew and Tristan Tate arrested in Romania for human trafficking**\n\nBrothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, together with Georgiana Naghel and Luana Alexandra Radu, received their first pre-trial arrest warrants on 30 December 2022, after being detained by DIICOT prosecutors the day before, following raids on their villa in Pipera and videochat studio.\n\nOn 20 January, at the request of the prosecutors, the Bucharest Court extended their remand warrants for a further 30 days, from 29 January to 27 February. Although the decision is not final and has already been challenged by the Tate brothers' lawyers, they remain in custody at least until 28 January, the last day of the first arrest warrant. In the coming days, the Bucharest Court of Appeal is due to decide whether Andrew and Tristan Tate and their two accomplices will remain in pre-trial detention or will be released or placed under house arrest from 29 January.\n\nThe DIICOT prosecutors managed to convince the Bucharest court judge to extend the Tate brothers' arrest warrants, arguing that if they are released they \"may exercise psychological control over the victims\".\n\nProsecutors also say that brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate could flee Romania if released from custody. In the context, DIICOT prosecutors used an earlier statement by one of the two eccentric millionaires, in which he said he had accounts in 19 countries around the world and could fly using several passports.\n\n\"If I make a mistake and England wants me in jail, I can fly with a Nigerian or American or English or Polish or Estonian passport. I have bank accounts in 19 countries,\" prosecutors quoted a statement by one of the Tate brothers in the indictment.\n\nThe arguments and evidence presented by the DIICOT prosecutors convinced the Bucharest court to extend their pre-trial detention warrants for another 30 days, and the judge considered that leaving them at large \"would create real risks for the proper conduct of the criminal trial\".\n\nAndrew and Tristan Tate are accused of \"setting up an organised criminal group in 2021 with a view to committing the crime of trafficking in human beings on the territory of Romania and other countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom\".\n\n\"The victims were then transported and sheltered in buildings in Ilfov county where, through acts of physical violence and psychological coercion (through intimidation, constant surveillance, control and the invocation of alleged debts), were sexually exploited by members of the group by being forced to engage in pornographic acts with a view to producing and disseminating material of such a nature via social media platforms and by being forced to perform forced labour in order to obtain significant financial benefits consisting of sums of money obtained as a result of users accessing the material\", according to the DIICOT.",

    "text": "My \"Friend\" of 10 Years is a \"Nice Guy\" Idk, I am feeling hurt and upset right now and idk when this feeling will go away. I (24f) have been friends with a guy (26m) for 10 years now. He lives across the continent, I am Canadian, and he is American for context. He told me when I was 14 that he had a huge crush on me. I let him know that I thought he was a great guy, but I was not interested in him that way. He was sad, but backed off for a few months\n\nOnce he got a decent paying job, he started sending me gifts. I let him know while I appreciated the gifts, I was still not interested in him romantically and did not need anything more. I valued him as a friend, but was still not interested in anything beyond that, and did not see a future where I would be interested.\n\nHe ended up coming to visit in 2019. He really tried to win me over on that trip. He bought me gifts and would butt ahead to pay for things before I could. I told him I didn't need gifts and could pay for my own things. I did not want to lead him on and was not interested in anything beyond friendship. I was frustrated with him as he was sad about that and seemed to still be trying to win me, but he went home shortly after.\n\nAfter his trip he got a girlfriend. He told me he was in love, wanted to get married, and have a life together. They had been dating over a year at this point. I was happy he found someone and happy he moved on. We have a larger friend group, and I had stepped back from most of the discord servers and group game nights he was in. I was glad I could play with the group as a whole without leading him on. I was happy I could be his friend without feeling like somehow basic kindness was leading him on. He is very close friends with one of my brothers, and wanted to introduce her to us, so he started planning a trip. I was ok with this as he had a gf who he claimed to be madly in love with.\n\nAbout 6 months ago I told him I was bi. He at first was super chill, then asked if I was interested joining his relationship. His gf was pan and poly, but willing to be mono for her partner if they wanted mono. I said no, I was not interested in a relationship, nor was I poly. The idea of a threesome was floated as sex can just be fun and no relationship attached. I said no. I did not want any form of intimate relationship. A little while later he mentioned him and his gf having relationship issues as she really wanted to experience being with a woman and was interested in me, and it could make their relationship stronger if we had a threesome or me and her hooked up. I said hard no to the threesome, I did not want to have sex with him. I also said no to sex with her as I do not feel comfortable sleeping with his gf, or anyone's gf. I told him again I do not want any type of romantic or intimate relationship.\n\nThe two of them broke up. He said it was her commitment issues and her wanting to be with a girl. She was dating a man a month after she moved out from his place.he booked a trip to visit and asked if he could have a date with me. I said no. He kept asking for a date. I said no. He started showering me with gifts. I said no. He told a bunch of mutual friends I wanted the bf experience without actually dating him. I told him no again and that I was pissed after I told him no for a decade he still thought I was interested in him, and now I have been slandered to the point some mutual friends are calling me a bitch and saying I'm using him. I stopped replying to anything private and only talked to him in public group chats. I told him I didn't feel comfortable being around him if he was going to constantly objectify and then throw a fit when I don't decide to date him. That was the last one on one convo we had. He messaged my Mom after and asked if she knew why his best friend (me) just ghosted him while he was struggling. She told him the fact he still couldn't get over me was overwhelming. I had a right to say no, and he needed to respect me. I needed space from him as I was feeling harassed and objectified, and he was making me feel attacked whenever he brought up a relationship.\n\nHe decided to still come visit for 2 weeks. He made a comment the week he was leaving for our city about how one of my guy friends tried to steal the last two girls he talked to after his breakup and now was chatting me up. I told him I was allowed to have guy friends and that he is allowed to talk to me and the other women in the friend groups. He then later made a comment about how once he was here I would be batting my eyelashes at him and flirting. I said no. I was not fucking interested in him. I would not be fucking flirting with him. If he tried this shit in person I would just not see him. I was pissed and reemed him out, and left the group call as he was defending himself and asking if I was ok and why I was lashing out.\n\nHe got here, and for the first couple of hours was fine. I always had my Dad or brother near me. When we got home he instantly started flirting and telling me how beautiful I was. I froze up, my Dad changed the topic and deflected for me. After that I finished the evening plans I had with him and my brothers, then decided to be true to my word and refuse to speak to him or see him again during his trip. I muted him on all socials. He managed to find my reddit by remembering posts I mentioned enjoying, and finding the common commenter. So I blocked him here. I told one of my brothers everything he said, my other brother asked not to know details as he didn't want to lose a whole friend group over my drama. Now I'm at a loss. I either drop out of that friend group with no explanation, tell them the truth that one of their close inner circle friends is at this point harassing me and let it blow up, which would piss off one of my brothers, or deal with being around him and just let myself be objectified.\n\nI am so done with guys. He gets so angry about \"nice guys\" too. How can he not see he is doing that to me? Does he see and just not care? Why did it take me so long to figure out  I didn't deserve to be harassed?",

    "text": "One Year Later: The Repurcussians of Anti-abortion Legislation It has been a year since the Supreme Court stripped women of their nearly 50 year right to make their own reproductive health-care decisions. This is the result. \n\n1) For the first time ever, a majority of Americans say abortion is morally acceptable and recent abortion laws are too strict.\n\n2) For the first time in two decades, more people identify as pro-choice than pro-life.\n\n3) For the first time in 49 years, “The Dobbs decision transferred all-or-nothing disputes to the states” (Wall Street Journal), an undue burden on state supreme courts.\n\n4) A recent NBC News poll found voters who oppose the court’s actions include 55 percent of men, 67 percent of women, 66 percent of suburban women, 77 percent of female voters ages 18-49, 92 percent of Democrats, 60 percent of independents and 31 percent of Republicans.\n\n5) A March17 - May 18 Kaiser Family Foundation survey of 569 OBGYN doctors revealed shocking findings: “68 percent found the [Dobbs] ruling has worsened their ability to manage pregnancy-related emergencies, [and] has worsened pregnancy-related mortality (64 percent), racial and ethnic inequities in maternal health (70 percent) and the ability to attract new OBGYNs to the field (55 percent).”\n\n6) Michele Goodwin, a legal expert in bioethics and health law, notes “A dramatic proliferation in anti-abortion legislation in the United States has coincided with this nation becoming the deadliest in the `developed world’ to be pregnant and attempt to give birth” (Ms., May 24, 2022).\n\n7) Black women are 3.5 times more likely to die due to maternal mortality than their white counterparts, unabated by abortion bans.\n\n8) The states with the highest maternal mortality rates also lead the nation in anti-abortion legislation.\n\n9) Isabella Oishi, Georgetown Law student, writes that since the Texas Heartbeat Act became law, it did not reduce the need for abortion care. Rather, there has been an 11-fold increase in Texans crossing state lines for abortions.\n\n10) Oishi further reveals that states prohibiting women to seek abortions in other states is “likely unconstitutional based on the right to travel, the Privileges and Immunities Clause and the Dormant Commerce Clause. The anti abortion legislation harkens back to the (1793) Fugitive Slave Act.”\n\n11) Federal judge, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, announced a constitutional right to abortion may be found in the 13th Amendment, ratified at the end of the Civil War in 1865 -- made slavery and involuntary servitude illegal. This is an area that was ignored by the Supreme Court.\n\n12) Andrew Koppelman, author of “Forced Labor: A Thirteenth Amendment Defense of Abortion,” writes “forced pregnancy’s violation of personal liberty is obvious. Restrictions on abortion also violate the 13th amendment’s guarantee of equality, because forcing women to be mothers makes them into a servant caste, a group that, by virtue of a status of birth, is held subject to a special duty to serve others and not themselves”.\n\n13) Elie Mystal, a legal scholar, wrote in the March 2022 issue of The Nation: “these anti-abortion states are borrowing traces of the sadistic logic and psychological tactics of this country’s enslavers.” As recently as June 29, Ja’han Jones, a research-based author, concurred with Mystal by noting “with abortion rights being rescinded across the country, it’s more important than ever that we call restrictions on this vital procedure what they actually are: slavery.”\n\nThe issues of pro-choice vs. pro-life, awareness of the 13th Amendment’s slavery and involuntary servitude prohibition, OBGYN doctor concerns, morality and maternal mortality have come center stage to voters and the 2024 election. GOP candidates will – most likely -- purposely ignore these multitude of findings while Democrats will tout women’s reproductive rights.\n\nSCOTUS’s 6-3 decision created this unnecessary chaos for 334 million Americans.\n\n[Source](https://thefulcrum.us/consequences-and-repercussions-scotus-dobbs)",

As title says, my direct manager during a team lunch a fortnight ago joked about me cheating on my partner with a coworker nearly a month ago.\n\nAbout three weeks ago a handful of American coworkers came over to our branch. I managed to get on with one of them and was talking with them about miscellaneous stuff well into the night. He was giving me advice on cooking as his former career was as a chef, and about career progression in general. It was just very friendly.\n\nThe next week we had a Christmas lunch with just my team and our manager, and during it my manager made a joke about me being a Dom (because I didn't want to tell my teammates about my partner's name, for privacy reasons), and more worryingly not too long later joking about me knowing how many windows were in the American coworker's hotel room (implying that I slept with the coworker I was out late with).\n\nI have autism so I'm really struggling with how to navigate this, I'm a bit slow on the uptake and since I work in a startup (only one HR person), I'm afraid if I say anything I may end up blacklisted in some form. I'm afraid my coworkers might have taken these jokes as truth and start questioning my integrity. I struggle with black-and-white thinking and the idea of people I respect thinking so bad of me sends me into a tailspin.\n\nIf I could get any advice on how to deal with this I would be very thankful.",

    "text": "Pregnant- how to tell my (American) boss - need advice Hi ladies, looking for some advice on handling the conversation with my manager about my pregnancy. Ideally from someone who has been in the scenario (on either side!) but any advice gladly taken. \n\nSome background- I am working for a large American company for just under a decade, but I am European and living in Europe and my contract is European. I have one child already - I took maternity leave from Dec 2021 to end July 2022. So I’ve been back at work over a year now. All my performance reviews have been exceeded expectations. \n\nAbout the job- my role is global though my manager and direct report sit in the US. I started as a junior member of the team and I’ve been running the team since end 2019. However, my career growth (read: pay) has been relatively stagnant because I’ve been very unfortunate- I’ve had at least 1 new manager a year and so each new manager I need to prove myself to, and they assume that my tasks are my “job” even though I’ve been steadily expanding my role every year. My job title has not changed since my old manager left and I took on her duties. \n\nAfter returning from maternity I was in the unique situation to be reporting back to a manager that I have previously reported to. I’m still on very good terms with my last manager and asked her opinion on career options/payrise. She said she had recommended it before her move. She advised me to ask about it immediately after returning, phrasing it like I had a lot of time to think on leave and I’m ready for the next step and my title should reflect my actual job. This went surprisingly well and my title was updated in the next month, along with some (seemingly) solid steps to getting to the next level.  \n\nHere’s the problem- I never got a payrise. When I expressed my disappointment with this, I was told it was in progress, they are different processes. A few months later I was told it was paused because annual review process was underway. Then there was a hiring freeze. Long story short this payrise has been dangled for a year with no update. My direct report is now basically outearning me (if you consider take home pay). I don’t begrudge her- I fought for her payrise. \n\nMy worry is the second I tell them I’m pregnant again, any hope of the payrise, and the move to director level disappear. There’s no guarantee that it’ll be the same boss when I return. I’m half thinking I say this outright- that I’m unhappy with the progress made and it’s making me reconsider my position but I cannot come down too strong as I have no intention of leaving right now. I feel like I rushed back from my first maternity leave and it made no difference. It’s making me second guess how long I should take this time. \n\nSorry for the long read, would love your advice!",

It was not clear who first shared the image online.\n\n\n“There’s no such thing as a free meal,” wrote Shen Yi, a professor in international politics at Fudan University, who has over two million followers on the platform. “They’ll need deliver KPIs in exchange,” he added, using the acronym for key performance indicators, implying the women would have to give something to the US government. \n\nThe criticism mostly targeted two women who posted about their experience on social media: Liu Qian, the Economist Group’s managing director for Greater China, and author Hao Jingfang, who previously worked for the China Development Research Foundation, which is managed by a branch of the State Council.  \n\n\n\nIn a now-deleted exchange, one Weibo user asked Hao, whose award-winning novel Folding Beijing is widely considered to be about income inequality in the capital, why she attended the dinner. Hao replied: “Because Yellen is the friendliest American official, she’s always dedicated to developing friendly China-US relations.”\n\nSeveral users accused Hao of being an “American spy,” while a post that garnered some 600 comments criticized the elite status of the women selected, saying “they have not worked in factories.”\n\nYellen’s exchange with women economists and entrepreneurs telegraphed the importance she places on female representation in elite decision-making. During her four-day trip to Beijing to stabilize ties with America’s biggest rival, the Chinese government exclusively put forward male officials to meet the first woman to run the US Treasury, according to publicly available information. \n\n\n“I see it all the time when I’m almost the only woman in the room,” Yellen told the women. “I’m sure many of you have that same experience at decision-making tables.”\n\nPresident Xi Jinping excluded women from China’s top leadership at last year’s congress for the first time in 25 years. Furthermore, as China struggles with a record low birth rate, women are being encouraged to take on more traditional care-giving roles. \n\nThe backlash against the women echoes attacks waged by online nationalists against foreign female journalists of ethnic Chinese origin working for Western news organizations. \n\n“Attackers routinely disparage their coverage of China and make crude sexual innuendos, including alarming threats of physical violence,” the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China wrote in a report last year on the issue. \n\n“Women’s participation in the workforce is one of the major drivers of creating inclusive growth,” the Treasury said in a statement after Yellen’s meeting. “Women’s contributions to economics, in particular, are important to help ensure that economic research and policymaking appropriately reflect society’s priorities.”",

    "text": "\"I forgot my prescription for ozempic\" 70 year old patient presents to urgent care,  visiting from Brazil, states he forgot his Ozempic in Brazil and wants a refill. \n\nHas no medical records with him, no proof of prescription. Not on any other diabetes medications. Doesn't ask for any other meds a 70 year old would typically be on. \n\nApparently patient is actually an American living in Brazil, claims to be a former Vietnam vet, but refuses to go to the VA for... reasons he would not go into. \n\nOffer him to work him up for diabetes but let him know we start with metformin or in severe cases insulin for diabetes management. \n\nHe promptly walks out. \n\nAnyone else start getting these requests?\n\nEdit to Add - thanks everyone for your comments and insights. Some questions that have come up:\n\n*Did the patient say they were diabetic or using the medication for weight loss?*\n\nThe patient said he was diabetic.\n\n*You shouldn't manage diabetes in the UC*\n\nWe routinely work up newly diabetic patients our in UC because we are part of a larger health system and PCP access is limited.\n\n*What would you have done with with labs? Isn't an A1C useless in your setting?*\n\nFor diabetics I will at least get a BMP, A1C, UA in preparation for follow up with our of our PCPs.\nIf the A1C is horrendously out of control, I would start on insulin and have urgent follow up with one of our endocrinologists.\n\nIf borderline A1C or at goal, then great, we have time. I would have asked the patient to contact his doctor to give us his records. If there was a significant delay in time and A1C wasn't quite at goal we could keep him on metformin until we get some records available as long as his Cr was ok. Spilling protein? Gets an ACE/ARB as well.\n\nIn this case the patient walked out prior to any of that.\n\n*You are gate keeping, you wouldn't do it with x drug*\n\nIn this case the patient had no records at all, which made me want to at least start a work up prior to treatment. Even for folks with hypertension asking for BP meds I would consider getting labs on them if they had 0 records. \n\nI also think my threshold for prescribing goes up with injectables. \n\nWe do have a significant ozempic shortage in our area, so we have been asked to be judicious with our prescribing.",

    "text": "What cases do you do in your OR on the weekends? I'm working at my first OR job (was PCU then ICU for years before that) and I work on the weekend shift. I was hired to be there for emergencies since we're a level II trauma center. But we do a lot more than emergencies on the weekends.\n\nWe do cases that could wait, and occasionally we do elective cases that didn't get done during the week for whatever reason. This means we're not prepared for a true emergency because we only have 1 team working on the weekends with a call team that I can call in for true emergencies where I need a second team or another set of hands.\n\nYet I'm expected to respond to all trauma level 1 calls and go down to the ER to evaluate the patient's need for surgery along with anesthesia. But if we're stuck in a toe amputation that could have waited for Monday, I can't leave to go see the gunshot in the ED. Or sometimes anesthesia will ask me to respond and call him if the ER patient needs them which means the surgeon gets pissed because I'm out of the room for 15 minutes or so.\n\nWe've complained to management for months and it falls on deaf ears. We got the anesthesiologists to complain about the safety concerns and it falls on deaf ears. We got a few surgeons to complain and it falls on deaf ears. They had some big doctor meeting about it and then all of a sudden the doctors who were pissed and vocal about it went completely silent and will no longer talk to us about our concerns.\n\nWe've had several close calls and it's starting to feel like management won't care until someone actually dies. And then I'm sure they'll find some way to blame it on us as if we haven't been raising the alarm flag for months or years while they buried their heads in the sand.\n\nI've been covering my ass by communicating my concerns in emails to my managers and forwarding the emails to my personal e-mail so they can't \"disappear.\"\n\nSo I would like to know if you work in the OR on weekends, what sort of cases do you do? I have no benchmark for what's normal since this is my first OR job. According to the standards of our OR's accreditation body (ACS) we're required to have a team available 24/7 for traumas, however if I am stuck in a case there is no other team available on site. The call team takes call from home and they have 30 minutes to respond. For trauma level 1's we are required to respond within 15 minutes. So even if I called my call team in the minute I heard a level 1 called overhead while I was in a case, they would not be able to respond within the time frame required by the American College of Surgeons.\n\nHere's the types of cases we routinely do on the weekends. Yes I understand that some of these are true emergencies or urgent but some feel elective or like they could wait.\n\nLap appy\n\nRobotic lap chole\n\nEx lap\n\nHernia repairs\n\nIM Nails / Ex Fix placements\n\nToe amputations / partial foot amputations\n\nI&D\n\nCraniotomies\n\nCysto cases usually for stones\n\nEGDs usually for bleeds or sometimes for food impactions\n\nLaminectomies and spine cases (sometimes for emergencies like cauda equina, sometimes for chronic back pain when the case didn't go during the week for whatever reason)\n\nHemi-arthroplasty\n\nTracheostomies\n\nBalloon kyphoplasties",

    "text": "Our rapidly growing shortage of doctors; how teaming nurse practitioners with medical AI advisors can more than fill the gap \n\n\"Currently, the U.S. is facing shortages of physicians, and it is looking as though it will not get better anytime soon. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, the U.S. will face shortages of 37,800 to 124,000 physicians across all specialties and subspecialties within the next decade.\n\nWith new patient wait-times already skyrocketing, averaging about 26 days in large markets, according to AMN Healthcare, adding a physician shortage will lead to a larger health crisis.\"\n\nhttps://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/when-physicians-and-health-it-leaders-embrace-ai-ally-mindset\n\nNurse practitioners can already perform the following tasks:\n\n1. Perform Physical Examinations\n2. Diagnose Illnesses\n3. Order and Interpret Diagnostic Tests\n4. Prescribe Medications\n5. Develop Treatment Plans\n6. Perform Procedures like suturing or minor surgical procedures.\n7. Manage Chronic Illness like diabetes or heart disease.\n8. Provide Preventive Health Services like vaccinations and screening tests.\n9. Refer Patients to Specialists\n10. Conduct Research\n\nSo, imagine nurse practitioners now having 24/7 smartphone access to AI medical advisors that are more intelligent and far more knowledgeable than today's top M.D. specialists. Imagine how many more medical tasks these nurse practitioners could then do that are today only assigned to doctors.\n\nThat may be a powerful strategy for turning our current scarcity of qualified healthcare providers into a large surplus. Based on how rapidly AI medical advisor technology is progressing, we're probably only a few years away from this much needed, cost-effective, paradigm shift in how healthcare is delivered.",

The teachers were completely confused because they've been saying it for years and asked for an explanation, but of course admin was not able to explain any of their reasoning behind it. One teacher (white woman) was specifically told that she \"doesn't understand the culture of the children (title one school, mostly African American)\" to which she reminded them that she is engaged to a black man and has a mixed race child. They didn't respond to that either and basically the teachers were told if they are ever heard saying it again, they would be fired. \n\nI tried searching this claim and found something about how it's equivalent to telling kids to \"shut up\", but even that seems like a stretch. Nothing about how it's racist. \n\nAnyone else ever heard this?\n\nEDIT:\nTo clarify: I don't think it's racist. I'm just curious if anyone has dealt with something similar with that phrase or another management skill with their admins trying to be \"white saviors\".

Without grades being taken into account at all.

    "text": "A little sad, a little scared First thing to know: I teach internationally. I'm an American-licensed ELA teacher for middle and high school, but I prefer to teach abroad. My parents live in Tennessee, and I'm home visiting them over the summer.\n\nToday, I went out to the Salvation Army to buy some shorts, as last academic year was a little stressful and I ate a bit too much takeout for things to fit the way they used to. So I'm browsing the shorts, feeling generally good about myself (I'd found a cute sunhat already) when I noticed a man staring at me.\n\nSecond thing to know: being an English teacher, I have a small collection of English-related T-shirts that I wear to work. These shirts are slightly subversive, but only if you squint. I happened to be wearing one that said \"Diversify Your Shelf\".\n\nI realize the man is trying to read my shirt, so with a smile, I tell him what it says and explain that, as an English teacher, I want to encourage my students to read from a variety of sources. I did not mention cultures, or backgrounds, or anything like that (even though that is definitely *also* what I mean by wearing this shirt). The words out of my mouth were 'variety of sources'.\n\nY'all. This man takes steps back from me like I'm *contagious*. Raises his hands and says, \"Oh, no. I know what you English and Social Studies teachers do. You take out real stuff from the curriculum and put in nonsense.\"\n\nI stare. Of course, despite not living in the US, I know what the rhetoric is surrounding teachers (especially in Southern/Bible Belt states). But I'm struck dumb; I can't quite believe this is happening to me when I'm out trying to find some damn *shorts* to fit my chubby ass.\n\nThe man's daughter scoots over to his side and says, \"Yeah, that's why I'm homeschooled. That's why I know the truth about the Holocaust.\"\n\nNow, while I don't doubt that, sooner or later, some states will absolutely try to remove Holocaust instruction from the curriculum, I don't think it's happened yet. I teach from US-made textbooks, so I *know* that the Holocaust is still very much part of our curriculum. I taught *The Diary of Anne Frank* a few weeks ago!\n\nI did not want to ask what 'truth' she meant, exactly. I suspect I know. And I know there is no point in debating someone so far gone that they can't bring themselves to acknowledge that the Holocaust happened.\n\nSo what comes out of my mouth to the dad is this: \"Yes, we're all monsters and demons, I know. Thanks very much and have a nice day.\" To the daughter, I say, \"One day you're going to grow up and read for yourself.\" Not even sure what I was trying to say there, but the dad called after me, \"Not you *personally!\"*\n\nThankfully by the time he said this, I was already at the front of the store paying for my hat and the one pair of shorts I'd managed to find before this all went down. The silver lining is that I like them very much and only paid $5 for both, so overall I'd say it was a win, even though I cried in the car on the way home.\n\nIt's just...so disheartening. We as teachers try so hard and have so little control over what we do and don't teach, what we can and can't say. We work hard, we care about our subjects and our students' learning. I want my students to love reading both the traditional and the new! My shirt was just a way of encouraging people to read other perspectives, and think of lives outside their own. How has something so basic, so milquetoast, become so polarizing? I can't imagine working in the US if this is even a fraction of what many of you deal with every day from dumbass parents like this. \n\nIn hindsight, I could have said all this to that man. But I suspect he wouldn't have heard it. Also, how is it our responsibility as caring teachers to be emotionally and mentally prepared for a debate when we're just existing out in the world? How has teaching become a profession to spit on and disrespect so casually?\n\nWhat I do know is that I'm going to keep wearing my 'subversive' T-shirts. \n\nBecause fuck people like that guy.",

    "text": "Stalker much? AITA?\n\nHad an interesting week interacting with a non-parent. I’m an ESL teacher and we have a new family with a complicated story-Syrians, moved to Lebanon, sponsored by Catholic charities, living in a house owned by a local Presbyterian church. The family speaks Arabic, and a representative is the Presbyterian church has been coming to the school with the family to register each student (they have three). She is not an emergency contact, the family hasn’t asked us to include her, and she doesn’t speak Arabic, so I’m not sure what time she is filling here. \n\n Thursday last week we had open house. At the end of the night I got an email from her saying that she didn’t understand why the last student to register in the family still had no schedule. He has met with the counselor just that day and as a senior, we needed to review his transcripts carefully to ensure he was enrolled in the right classes. I had plans to be out the following Friday, so I forwarded the email to the school counselor and the ESL case manager in charge of that child’s end of the alphabet. I don’t know why she emailed me in the first place. As the department chair, I am kinda involved in each student, but I’d like to see the rest of my team approach a situation before I step in. \n\nI come in this week on Tuesday (Monday there was no school for Labor Day) and find a voicemail from 9:00 am Friday insisting that I needed to call her back to discuss the reasons why this student still did not have a schedule. I also got note in my mailbox that was written in the back of an email her husband (yet another legally unaffiliated adult) had sent to the case manager with a written note complaining that the case manager and guidance counselor weren’t responding to her, saying it was ridiculous she had to resort to writing a not on paper. The letter explained how she heard a friend who worked in special Ed at a neighboring district who suggested that these students should not be enrolled in American history class until they’ve learned English. Well, I hate to break it to her, but that’s not how the system works.  State law still requires that they earn all required credits in the span of four years, so they take classes in the same schedule as a native English speaker. After talking with the front office staff, I  B found out she had wanted to come in and talk with me on Friday when she wrote the note and made enough of a scene that the secretaries now call her crazy. And they tell me she was waiting in her car at the school that morning. \n\nThe waiting in the car was my final straw. I emailed the story to the principal and the school resource officer. The last update I got from the principal said that he was going to take part in the next meeting that involved this crazy church lady to establish protocols and roles, but I got the feeling he thinks I’ve overreacted. \n\nTLDR/ crazy lady with no legal rights to students is harassing me for information I can’t give.",

    "text": "I now understand why so many are choosing to drop out of the workforce. I now understand why so many people have decided to exit the work force voluntarily. They are tired of being told false promises and working their butt off just to be paid what a homeless person makes holding up a sign. The fact that the minimum wage is still 7.25 an hour should warrant a national worker strike. This number is totally unacceptable, unethical and unsustainable. We have so many that are working homeless people clocking into their jobs giving it their all just to sleep in a parking lot. How exciting. The American dream died and greed has killed it. Meanwhile boomers get to retire early we probably won't be able to retire at all. We all know it's wrong and because we know it is wrong it will fester in our subconscious making every day of remedial labor more dull and depressing. How can anyone be content with being paid 400x less than the CEO of the company they work for? If they consider your labor so valueless than why work for them at all?\n\nPeople in their 20's are losing. Society has utterly failed them. They butter us up with school and feed us false promises in the educational system. \"Get good grades!\" \"Go to college!\" \"Get a good job!\" \"Buy a house!\" \"Start a family!\" etc. Just for these same people to be hit with the biggest reality check they have ever seen once they reach the age of adulthood. We thrust these young people out into the world with false expectations and once reality comes crashing down they fall into a pit of depression. Depressed that they are most likely never going to make enough to own a home. Depressed that they will never be able to retire. Depressed that they will never be able to comfortably start a family. Depressed that their workplace will never treat them with respect. Depressed that they live paycheck to paycheck and are always on the brink of homelessness. What do we expect of these people? To be content as third class citizens within a two tier system? While the ultra mega rich buy up their 300th house the average working man can barely afford rent? Is this really a position anyone would be content with in the richest country to ever exist? The numbers speak for themselves. We are dealing with a massive worker shortage and for good reason. People are no longer putting up with long hours, low pay, and over-productivity. \n\nSociety can not function without the working class. However, society would function perfectly fine without the CEO's and the wall street speculators. We need more people to \"drop out\" of the work force and go on strike. Let these corporations shoot themselves in the foot. We need more unions, more quiet quitters, and more disobedience. This has become a class war. I was just driving past a Ford factory and the entire work force was on strike at 11pm at night! Teach these companies that the real power lies within the people. If a company does not pay over 20 dollars an hour NO ONE should work for that company. We need to make it so low pay is completely unacceptable within our society. If you are at a job interview and the employer tells you the job only pays 15 dollars an hour you should walk out of the interview immediately. If an employer is making you work long hours with low pay give that employer an ultimatum. Either you pay me a living wage or you find someone else to work. You'd be surprised how much these companies are pulling in daily. The management class are all driving 100,000 dollar cars meanwhile those that do the majority of the labor can only afford to take a bus. Society has grown a subconscious resentment towards the upper classes over the years. Items have tripled in price yet we are still getting paid the same wages. These corporations want us to fend for ourselves while at the same time expecting unending loyalty towards them. You break your back and in return you can buy cheap food to sustain yourself and maybe if you are lucky you can buy a studio apartment and a car. You won't be able to afford healthcare. You won't be able to afford dental. You won't be able to eat healthy. You won't be able to save in case of an emergency. They are working us towards our death and we don't even know it. This is modern day slavery but instead of a whip they hand you a credit card. In return they get your soul. Complete obedience is the only definition of a \"good worker\" in this society. Good luck trying to call off to spend time with your family. In America it is perfectly legal to give ZERO PTO hours a year. You will work yourself to death in such a system, just in time for your retirement. What a lovely exchange. In return for dedicating 50 years of your life for this company you will be rewarded with back pain, health issues, and an early death. The shareholders are laughing all the way to the bank thinking about how much money they are making off of everyone else's suffering. They will say \"People just don't want to work anymore!\" but what they are really saying is that people do not want to live in an exploitative system that treats them like dirt and does not give them the necessity's of a quality life. People are wising up.",

    "text": "Reaching Extreme Burnout. This Is No Longer Sustainable. American Work Culture Is Literally Slavery. So I have been working at my family business for the last 2 years and It has been an experience to say the least. I am the only young person in my family who is working for the business. None of my cousins and siblings work for it except for me. But because I am the oldest son in the family and share my father, grandfather and great grandfathers name I am expected to basically run the business at  some point. The only problem is I lack any authority at said business and am basically a low level worker and have to kiss the feet of the manager like everyone else. I have been doing this for two years and have only went from 10 dollars an hour to 14 dollars an hour all while my workload has doubled in the meantime. On top of that all of my co-workers and management expect me to work twice as hard as everyone else because I am related to the owners of the company. \n\nI have no power. No authority. No leniency. Yet people see me as if I am in some sort of privileged position. I could go to the local McDonalds and make more than I am making at this family run business. Back in my parents generation this was a viable career path but now it's actually a guaranteed path to poverty. I keep being told some day I will be running the whole company but even if I do get promoted everyone around me will only see it as nepotism so it won't matter anyway. \n\nAlso my family is dirt poor. My parents need financial help paying mortgage every month. I have to literally financially help them in order for them not to be homeless. Mentally ill sister, physically disabled mom, rapidly aging dad. Yet I am always told how spoiled I am and how good I have it. I have just given up everything in my life to my job. I work triple double shifts every weekend. Yet management says I don't do anything and she is the only one that is doing things. I work weekends while everyone else gets weekends off. No one ever offers to cover for me. I am never told what good things I do only the bad. If anyone does anything wrong they immediately blame me. There is nothing in the world that can be worth this amount of bullshit. I have to go to work and listen to bullshit and then go home after a 16 hour shift to listen to some more bullshit. All for the grand price of not being able to move out of my parents house and not even able to afford three meals a day and independence. The more I work at this company the more I feel like my soul is being sucked out of me.  \n\nEvery time I dare ask for a raise I am told you just have to work your way up because that's what I did. Well that was in the 80's when the job was much easier and wasn't so short staffed and overly bureaucratic. You would have to be insane to work in this care work field at this point. Matter of fact the entire healthcare industry isn't even worth working in anymore due to the overworking of its workers. You are expected to literally work yourself to death in order to save others. Which is a conflict of ethics. If the stress of working a high stress job doesn't kill you the stress of being poor and having to worry about bills will kill you in the end. \n\nI am too poor to move out yet too rich to pack up and start a new life somewhere else. If I had zero dollars to my name and no family ties I would literally just leave this state and start a new life from scratch. But due to my family depending on me financially and also my job depending on me to fill the gaps I literally cannot leave anywhere. No vacation. No days off. Just an endless cycle of work and then go home and stress about tomorrow. \n\nThe sad thing is I use to be one of the pull yourself up by the boot straps types. I bought it hook line and sinker as a kid/teenager. I was always a \"Good kid\" that did whatever he was told and never questioned anything. Then I slowly started to realize just how unfair this all is. How unsustainable my mindset really was. Years would pass by working harder than ever and yet I would be exactly where I started. It's a total scam.\n\nI try to find time to do things I enjoy but it's never enough time available. After getting done with hygiene, cleaning, bills, driving, sleep and eating there is literally no time left. An endless cycle of chasing the dragon. Working increasingly harder trying to achieve something unattainable. Yeah you could get lucky and hit it big but 99% of people will just burn themselves out being a \"good worker\". \n\nThe point I am trying to make is that the current status-quo is unsustainable. Those who are not sociopaths will be exploited by those that are sociopaths. America is the best example of this. There are billionaires that only became billionaires because their parents robbed and pillaged the working class. Yet these same billionaires will preach to the masses about \"Hard work\". Can we please stop using the term \"Hard work\" because hard work isn't healthy in the slightest. We should be telling people to have a balanced work life. And we wonder why we are facing a mental health crisis. This is why. People lose their minds trying to keep up with the Joneses feeling constantly inadequate so instead of looking in the mirror and examining themselves from the inside they look towards consuming goods and capital AKA numbers on a screen. It is in no way a good measurement of the quality of a human being. We have become so propagandized by this radical narcissist worshipping system that we praise the very people who enslave us. The only route this will lead us as a people is towards total barbarism. And we are seeing it today. Turn on your local news station. Murders, crimes, robberies, theft, riots, corruption, scams and the list goes on... \n\nA huge number of society has lost all faith in the system. Why should they be a good person when the system doesn't reward those that are good? The people running this country are criminals. How does a congressman make half a million dollars? By lying, cheating, and manipulating his way to the top of the leaderboard. Yet we are told to accept our lot in life and stay in our place while the elite class gobbles up everything we own and monopolizes basic necessities like food, housing transportation, education and healthcare. It is a level of hypocrisy that should never be forgiven. It is a level of hypocrisy that should never be ignored. It is a level of hypocrisy that will never and has never been sustainable in any society on the face of the Earth. We milk our planet dry for digits on a screen. We ignore family, friends and our passions so that some rich guy in a mansion can get even more rich. That is our one and only contribution. That is our one and only goal in this system. They take from us everything and give us just enough to show up to work. But never enough to enjoy life. \n\nUnions are a start but it isn't enough. We need a national rethink on our goals, culture, ideals and values. Otherwise this cycle will just continue. The rich will get rich and use their power to dominate the poor. We need to stop this from ever happening again otherwise the planet will become a wasteland. In some places it already is. Look at places like Congo where international oil conglomerates literally control the government, the resources, the environment, and use violence to dominate the poor. America is quickly shifting in that direction if we don't change soon. In 1900 90% of Americans were self employed now the number is less than 10%.  We use to own our own shops, create our own products, contribute to our communities now we live in a corporate void devoid of life and liberty. It is an affront to the American dream. When the hell will people finally wake up and realize this? How low do we have to go before we finallly realize we have made a mistake? How many more skid rows and Kensington Avenues need to be erected before our conscious finally tells us this is wrong? Only time will tell...\n\n&#x200B;",

    "text": "If things don't change soon this country might not survive the next decade. America is centuries behind the rest of the world when it comes to workers rights. We have put up with this nonsense time and time again. we continue on and on with this neo-slavery model of the rat race. Humans are no longer longer seen as humans with emotions, differences, aspirations, character, families and community's but rather a tool for corporations to exploit. America is designed to make you go crazy. It may not be now, it may not be 20 years from now. But if you continue to put up with the 80 hour week model a lot of us endure you will go crazy at some point.\n\nThe most minuscule medical diagnosis could set you back thousands of dollars. It is at this stage you realize the hospital is not your friend. At your weakest moment you will be given a bill which will mean you will have to put extra hours in at the office. So you finally graduate school, and you think your position in life will finally change but again...you are handed a bill which of course means you will have to put in extra hours at the office.\n\nSo decades pass and you think you finally see the light at the end of the tunnel but suddenly your rent goes up by a few hundred dollars. You must yet again...put more hours...in...the....office.\n\nNo matter how much you work no matter how hard you try the slightest inconvenience or mistake can set you back years if not decades. The American dream of vast acres of land to be explored and tamed to your liking is over. If you are lucky you will be able to sign up for a 30 year loan with 5% interest rates on a 500,000 dollar home somewhere moderately safe. But most of us will have to settle with room mates and the unlucky ones might have to sleep in their car or a motel. We have an entire generation of men, woman, and children with almost zero stability from month to month. Our future is uncertain and we are at the mercy of those with more power, more resources and more connections. \n\nIt is the equivalent of joining a game of monopoly at the tail end of the game and being told \"Pull yourself up by the bootstraps! You can win if you just put your mind to it!\" Those that are very lucky might be able to buy a plot or two but the vast majority of us will go completely bankrupt with nothing to show for it...just as the game intended. \n\nAnother thing that people forget is that as we dedicate more and more of our lives to our jobs the less social, family and community ties we will have. Hanging out with friends becomes increasingly more difficult. setting aside time for a family event becomes impossible. Having time to meet your neighbors or spending a few minutes to chat with people in your community becomes a chore. A lot of us are simply hanging by a thread if hanging by anything at all. Every second counts in todays world of hustle culture. You spend 8 hours sleeping in preparation for work in the morning. Then you spend a further hour in the morning preparing yourself for work. Then you spend another hour driving to work. Then you spend a further 8 or more hours at work. then another hour driving home in high stress rush hour traffic. If you are lucky you might get a couple of hours at the end of your day to do as you please. But in the end you will never really enjoy it because in the back of your mind you know you are going to have to go through the same anxiety riddled scenario the very next day. \n\nIn an ideal world people wouldn't fear waking up in the morning. People would look up to their boss as a leader and the worker would be comfortable traveling from point A to point B without fearing death. Commuting to work should be paid by the company you are working for. If they cannot afford to transport workers to their job then they should be paying enough taxes to build the appropriate public transportation.  America has become Disney Land for the rich and an open air prison for the poor. You have to pay 2000 dollars or more for a drivable car just to get to work when that money could go to a stable non stress inducing transportation system. Nearly 70 percent of drivers have driving anxiety. Why is so much of our life dedicated to something that makes us scared and fearful? Humans weren't meant to drive 2 ton vehicles going 70 miles per hour. For those of us that do not feel comfortable doing so there should be alternate options. People that are incapable of driving shouldn't be cut off from the rest of their community and forced to walk hours at a time to get needed jobs/services. If you live in Michigan you would know it is a city built for cars, not people and it is a nerve wrecking nightmare. The only construction that is taking place here is for cars never for humans. The roads are also undrivable filled with massive potholes that can disintegrate your car in an instant, and you will have to spend thousands on maintenance. so yeah...fun right?\n\nI do not know how much longer the American worker will continue to take these unfair conditions. Most people do not have anyone to talk to because we have dedicated our lives to work instead of each other. There should be a 25 dollar minimum wage to compensate for all the things I just mentioned. Workers should not be spending half their income on housing and the other half on transportation. We need to start demanding those in charge start designing a livable society that doesn't require being in the top 1 percent to enjoy. How has our standard of living fallen so far since the 50's...I'll tell you why. Mismanagement, inequality, bad planning and corporate greed. Why should the people in charge care about the roads when they can just use their 2 million dollar helicopter to  take them to their 8th mega mansion? Meanwhile the ones that work under them are walking tens of miles to work because unfortunately owning a car is becoming increasingly unaffordable to many.\n\nThe commoners have had enough. Mental wellbeing is at an all time low. You can not have a functioning society with this many problems being swept under the rug. This is the first time in American history the new generation will grow up poorer than the old generation. Wealth is usually passed on but this time there just isn't anything left to pass on... The only positive thing I can say about what is happening here is that it may be a lesson for future generations to prevent this from ever happening again. People are just starting to wise up to the absolute chaos that is this so called \"economy\" that slowly sucks the life out of you day by day and you are expected to sell a piece of your soul every time you head in to work. So enjoy your freedom. The freedom to be at the mercy of your boss. The freedom to be at the mercy of your landlord. The freedom to go bankrupt at the slightest medical inconvenience. The freedom to drive a 2 ton vehicle on highly convoluted and overcrowded roads. The freedom to lease your labor to a corporation and never own your own creations. The freedom to be paid an unlivable wage that guarantees poverty. The freedom to give up family, friendships and community in favor of meeting deadlines. The freedom to pay exorbitant bills to multi billion dollar companies that see you as a resource. The freedom to delay retirement a few decades because you have been working your whole life and still own nothing. The freedom to \"buy\" a house by signing a 30 year loan. The freedom to go to school and be buried in student loan debt. The freedom to work your entire life for a company expecting a promotion just for them to replace you with a robot at the drop of a hat. The American dream is just that a dream. It's time to enter the real world and address the problems we have been ignoring since the 60's\n\n1. Provided food and housing for all that work full time (No one should be working and homeless)\n2. Safe, accessible, and low cost public transportation for morning commutes. (People should not be forced to drive just to go to their local grocery store)\n3. Equal distribution of corporate resources/profits amongst the workers.  (Workers should each be given a percentage of the profits made by a corporation. Workers should not be doing all the work and be given a tiny percentile of profits)\n4. Public healthcare system that is affordable (Anyone who is working should be able to be healthy while they work. No one should be working while unable to afford care for their bodies)\n5. A realistic and fair way to achieve the American dream (Start family/House/College)\n6. Give all workers a voice in their company's. (Democratize work force. Everyone gets to vote, disagree, or agree to workforce policies)\n7. Minimum wage of 25 dollars an hour adjusted each year for inflation ( Every year workers will be paid a livable wage no one should be working 10 dollars an hour while their CEO is making 10 million)\n8. Better safety protocols in the workplace (People shouldn't put their health/safety at risk just to meet insane quotas)\n9. Guaranteed vacation for at least 1 month out of the year. (We should be working to live not living to work)\n10. Transparent hiring practices (The current method of hiring is shameful and disgraceful to the worker. No one should have to show up to 5 interviews and take 2 hour long test just to not even land the job. Hiring should be transparent for the applicant. If you are denied for \"Having too much experience\" or \"Not having enough experience\" The employer must compensate you for wasted time. This will give more of an incentive for companies to actually hire applicants rather than just waste 100 applicants time just to hire no one. The requirements for the position should be listed beforehand and if the applicant meets all those requirements and still isn't hired the employer should give reasons why. If they can't give a valid reason they should compensate you for wasted time. The current job market has completely alienated job seekers. it's time to put an end to companies lying about high wages to applicants on the job flyer just for them to show up to an interview and being told they would only be paid 8 dollars an hour. In a fair market this would be seen as fraud and false advertising. But because we care so little about workers companies are allowed to get away with this unbelievable behavior. And they wonder why no one wants to work?)\n\nThat is it. I hope that some of you took in what I have said. After years of suffering on dirt poor wages and living in the rat race I am finally starting to see it for what is really is. A scam. Everything is designed to funnel money out of the workers pockets, pull the roof from over the workers head, and take food out of the workers mouth. If you think working will make you happy you haven't been paying attention for the last 50 years. The worker is being hit from all sides and it is up to us to stand up as a class and say enough is enough. The alternative is to keep living as indentured servants to your chosen bank or corporation. Is that truly a life you'd like to live? To die of old age knowing you wasted so much on so little? At your final moments you look back on all the years wasted trying to keep up with the never ending expectations and demands put on you by our unequal economy. Having the rug pulled right from under you before your last breath. You realize it was all a scam. The American dream is just a dream. All the real world experiences you missed out on to chase the imaginary label of \"success\" but at the cost of your fulfillment, wellbeing and mental stability. Your boss doesn't show up to your funeral. Neither does your land lord, manager, banker, insurance agent, CEO, bill collector, etc. The only ones that show up is your friends and family that you've been ignoring all your life, chasing a lie. You are buried shortly after and the company that you worked for, for 50 years quickly replaces you with no mention of your disappearance. Ready to start the process all over again with the next sucker. The exploiters laugh knowing that you died owning nothing all while their wealth expanded exponentially. This is a fair system... but only to those at the top of the scheme. And you let them do it.",

    "text": "I hope the TSMC plant in Arizona fails. Drinking here at The Horny Toad, real place here. \n\nI need to rant about them, almost everything you hear from the news about how they treat their employees to contractors is absolutely absimal and true. From internal to contractors, to myself. This all from how I keep seeing them in the news here constantly complaining about American workers. \n\nStarting with myself, I am in relevant field, you could Google maps to pretty much pick one of the five other companies here. Their pay and expectations of what they want and how they want to treat you is downright pathetically amazing in the worst possible way. Thinking they can get away with it here, I think they get away with in Taiwan but thankfully not here. This is true with all the job openings they have. \n\nStart with the healthcare, they really are tying their absolute damdest to not pay a single cent on that, as well with your pay. Basically if you apply say the ad says fifty thousand a year or even hundred thousand a year they will be constantly trying to low ball you and not offer benefits if you take the so called max amount. That's it you will probably never get a raise. Contractors are absolutely treated worse then employees, this has been swept under the rug, but multiple higher ups have been lets say removed but still work their for massive drinking problems leading to straight up screaming at construction workers for following OSHA rules, leading to slower work times according to them. \n\nDo not let them bring over workers overseas to work on this plant it is absolutely to bypass unions, the little we have here and not pay anyone what they/we are worth. \n\nBesides toxic working conditions to poor management, down to not even understanding or recognizing basic American safety laws. This place should absolutely be shut down for that alone. \n\nThe best in a short summary coming from meeting one of the workers their from South Korea and hates how it's run. I guess over in South Korea they have no short supply of workers / younger generation willing to undercut themselves to get into these huge corporations. South Korea as I understand from that has a system that works as reverse eBay for employees/employer, you undersell yourself to get that position. This then removes anyone who wants to make over that amount, thus finding the cheapest person for that job. He thinks it's almost run exactly the same way in Taiwan. A couple engineer buddies applied and they straight up ignored the follow up after how they were treated during the interviews. My one friend works with an Australian engineering firm that straight up refuses to work with TSMC anymore. \n\nThat fiftyish Billion invested consider it gone, or America would need to hostile takeover it. It's now an American run and union controlled company, our tax dollars paid for it. In all I really hope that plant fails for the right reason and fixes everything. \n\nDo I think it will absolutely not, with the president constantly visiting and massive news presence. The last and biggest reason being the amount of money invested into this place. I really hope it does to show that Americans are not going to take it anymore. \n\nJust wanted to add saw they are trying to expand into Europe, I know you have stronger labor laws then us. I will be interesting to see if they try to pull the same crap over there.",

    "text": "Forced Career Switch Propaganda? Hello everyone, do you think popular media, education, and our own politicians are forcing us to learn or work in STEM, healthcare, and construction trade related careers? We had Nancy Pelosi telling pipeline workers to learn how to code, TikTok is putting a STEM algorithmic section on its platform, and YouTubers and platforms like Reddit just promotes STEM, healthcare, and skilled trade careers. With the advancement of AI, I think it can be very possible that the only career options left are to become forms of Doctors, Scientists, Engineers, Architects, and Skilled Tradesmen. Only exceptions are the creative and entertainment industries. I’m starting to see these same types of jobs pushed on us everyday.\n\nI’m already in an engineering/architect field, I’m just wondering what would happen to the fast food worker, retail worker, warehouse worker, delivery driver, truck driver, middle and lower managers etc. and they make up the majority of the American workforce. How would they adapt? I’m sure some of those workers got restrictions, no access to money and education, lack of skills and experience, could be disabled, or genuinely not interested in being in STEM, healthcare, and construction trades. How would the government accommodate to such a large working class?\n\nI don’t think AI will takeover, but we will have to adapt to AI and Robots working with us on the clock. However, that will lead us into a whole different discussion such as corporations lowering our pay because we don’t do as much “work” and giving us a 4 day/32 hour work weeks just so corporations can justify lowering our pay because we aren’t as “productive” than AI.",

    "text": "New Professionalism - Outline I wrote for article in late 2020 and never wrote (ADHD) Background : I (37m) am a senior hiring manager for a fairly large tech company, who grew during the 90s and 2000’s implementing your stereotypical boiler room / party hard culture. Like almost everyone else in management there, I “paid my dues” and worked my way up from entry level sales. Like everyone else , I had my personal life meets career crisis during  pandemic lockdown , and started seeing a therapist to work on my child wounds - which I was ironically able to monetize in my sales career- but was coming to a tipping point in my relationship at home . It made me need to take some space from work. It wasn’t just PTO. When I was working, I cut the bullshit that was draining me I previously thought was necessary for success ( old professionalism), and told all of my team members to do the same for their mental health . Our number went up 60% YOY. \n\nMeanwhile I started seeing how much Gen Z was being resilient and independent with their side hustles WSB, NFTs , IG, Onlyfans (hate but it’s facts) while stacking unemployment checks that were LARGER than we paid our entry level people ….. it basically made the Antiwork / Quiet Quitting trend that we are seeing leveraged toward the employee in extraordinary circumstances.  Having been in their shoes with LESS leverage during the last recession, I was like ….Damn I would have quit for sure . I myself was taking some space for mental health and still doing well , so I basically told my team “figure out how to make goal and live your best life when lockdown is over . Take all the PTO you need so that you go hard when you’re here . Figure out what u wanna do here and what pisses you off and lmk “ . I started building a MUCH better team culture and was seeing the benefits of less time on clock yielding more revenue . I wanted to write an academic paper to the Boomers on how and why that needs to be enacted across mainstream business culture …and ofc I never ended up writing it smh . \n\nAnyway, this was the outline I wrote below , and I thought given the timing (2020) it was an interesting share for #antiwork in 2022\n——————————————————\n\nThe pandemic did not introduce new trends. It sped up existing trends 10x. Far before COVID-19, the codependency dynamics between employee and company were already changing. The tech industry was the first the acknowledge this, making a focused investment into improving worker satisfaction.  \n \nThesis: Old Professionalism is defined as the societal ethos around American workplace culture in the Pre-Pandemic era. An esoteric byproduct of multi-generational economic prosperity, Old Professionalism established expectations (and ultimately pre-requisites) for effective career advancement in the workplace rooted in classist frameworks. These institutionalized requirements for professional success had already been eroded in society through the Digital Age. For example, no longer are those who cannot afford a 6-figure education restricted from accessing Ivy League caliber content online. Old Professionalism will ultimately become the primary similarity amongst the blue chip, established companies who fade in relevance in the Post-Pandemic world.   On the other hand, those companies who embrace transparency, authenticity, empathy, personal empowerment, and humility will thrive in this societal paradigm shift of New Professionalism.\n \nCore tenets of New Professionalism\n-        Transparency\no   “All of the info is out there” - Pricing & Information Sharing\no   Personal lives in social media\no   Internal communication\n-        Authenticity\no   Why I hate scripts\no   Inconsistent tone across platforms\no   Homogenized speech\n-        Empathy\no   #MeToo & BLM\no   Relating to variance of hustle\no   “Relationships Matter”\n-        Personal Empowerment\no   System building to align goals around future-self  \no   The Art of Accountability- Hint: It’s the hiring!\no   Know your Shit, Be Yourself\n-        Humility\no   Delegate for scale, not relaxation\no   Fail together, win together\no   Critical introspection &\n \nConcepts covered within:\n-        Remote working and the antiquated system of offices 5 days/week\n-        Phony talking tracks on phone/email/pitches\n-        Jekyl/Hyde in the work/personal lives of professionals who lack authenticity\n-        You can’t have success without happiness, and vice versa",

    "text": "Work Reform History Hero: George McNeill (1852) Hi all!  I thought it would be nice to discuss and link a story about someone who has fought before us.  Would love to see posts about your hometown work reform heroes.  \n\nGeorge McNeill:  Work Reform History Hero.  \n\n\n\nArticle Text:  \n\nOn this day in 1852, hundreds of mill workers at the Woolen Company in Amesbury [Massachusetts] walked out on strike. Fourteen-year-old George McNeill, who had worked in the carding room since he was ten, immediately organized the children employed by the mill into a mutual benefit association. This began his lifelong commitment to bettering the lives of working men, women, and children. His decades of advocacy for an eight-hour workday earned him the title \"father of the eight-hour movement.\" In 1869, he was instrumental in persuading the state legislature to create the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of Labor. He was co-director of the bureau, which was the first in the nation and the model for the U. S. Department of Labor.  \n\nBeginning in 1847, ten-year-old George McNeill worked at a textile mill from 5:00 in the morning to 7:00 at night. The workers were allowed a 30-minute break for breakfast, 15 minutes for \"luncheon privileges,\" and 45 for dinner. In 1852 the new manager, John Derby, decided this was excessively generous and announced the elimination of the morning and afternoon breaks. On June 1st, 100 employees openly defied his orders; they left for their customary morning break and did not return. Derby fired them all. The following day, spinners, weavers, and workers in the carding room went out on strike.\n\nOn June 15th Amesbury town meeting recorded its \"united protest\" against the Salisbury Corporation, which owned the mill, and urged \"legislative action restricting the hours of labor of manufacturing companies.\" It then authorized the selectmen \"to expend a sum not exceeding $2,000 if in their judgment it is needed for [strikers'] relief.\" The neighboring town of Salisbury also voted unanimously to support the strikers and called on the legislature to limit the workday to ten hours.  \n\nThe striking workers tried to negotiate with Derby, but the mill owners brought in police guards and hired 50 Irish immigrants to operate the machinery. The strikers never won their demands; nor did they get their jobs back. The Derby strike would be considered a failure except that it launched the career of George McNeill. For the remainder of his life he would be at the center of every major effort on behalf of the working people of Massachusetts.  \n\nWith the end of the Civil War, the drive for improved working conditions gained momentum. The National Labor Union, formed in 1864, enjoyed some success before it collapsed during the economic depression of 1868. Other labor organizations sprang up, but another long depression that began in 1873 undermined workers' bargaining power. As McNeill put it, \"an empty stomach can make no contracts.\"  \n\nMcNeill and other labor activists pressed on even when hard times made organizing difficult. By 1863 McNeill had moved from Amesbury to Boston; that year he co-founded the Grand Eight-Hour League. Five years later, the group became the Boston Eight-Hour League. George McNeill served as its president from 1869 to 1874.  \n\nA firm believer in \"organize, organize, organize\" and a brilliant consensus builder, he brought together not only workers but legislators and civic leaders. Recognizing the power of the press, he edited labor publications in New York City, Fall River, and Paterson, New Jersey. While he helped win passage of a number of federal and state eight-hour laws, the statutes were rarely enforced. Employers easily found ways to get around them.  \n\nTogether with abolitionist and reformer Wendell Phillips, McNeill lobbied the Massachusetts legislature to establish a Bureau of Statistics of Labor. He was appointed co-director. Under his leadership, the bureau published some of the nation's first studies on the conditions of working people. Among them was one showing that at least 25,000 children in Massachusetts were \"growing up without any, or but the slightest knowledge of the rudiments of education.\" In part as a result of the bureau's work, in 1874 the legislature passed a law limiting children and women working in factory jobs to ten-hour days.  \n\nConcern that McNeill's activism conflicted with his duties at the bureau led to his dismissal as its director. However, shortly thereafter, he was given the job of monitoring the state requirement that factory owners provide schooling for all 10- to 15-year-olds who worked 10-hour days. He found countless violations. \"I plead for the little ones,\" he wrote in an 1875 report. \"Ignorance and poverty are twin monsters, and education is a means of removing both. . . . We must work for universal education.\"  \n\nGarment workers in Philadelphia had formed the Noble and Holy Order of Knights of Labor in 1869. In 1876 the Knights adopted almost to the word a declaration of principles McNeill had written for another labor congress. In 1883 he joined the Knights and became treasurer of District 30 (Massachusetts), the largest of the state organizations. By 1886 the Knights of Labor had 750,000 members across the nation.  \n\nThe Knights favored arbitration over strikes, sought to cooperate with employers whenever feasible, and had faith in the legislative process. Their goal was a cooperative commonwealth with an economy \"organized upon principles affirming that all citizens enjoyed an equal right to independence and a decent livelihood.\" The eight-hour day was central to their platform, and they believed they could achieve it through legislation rather than activism.  \n\nIn May 1886 thousands of union workers defied the Knights' leadership and struck for an eight-hour day. Many of the strikes ended in appalling violence against the strikers. Frustrated working people all over the country turned to the newly formed American Federation of Labor (AFL), which promoted \"pure and simple unionism.\" George McNeill was one of them.  \n\nFor the next 20 years, he devoted himself to the AFL and the workers it represented. Hundreds of labor representatives — local, state, and national — attended the memorial service that followed his death in 1906. AFL president Samuel Gompers gave the eulogy.",

    "text": "How to get my \"mojo\" back? I've lost my passion and desire for having a business career A few years ago, I was business major in college, with dreams of working in a big company, having a fancy office job where I get to dress in slacks and button up shirts, be considered smart, educated, and financially successful. I had dreams like a little boy who looks up to Mickey Mantle or Michael Jordan, except I idolized business people. I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do, but if it could be summarized in one word, I wanted to be a yuppie. Yep, that old outdated term from the 80s/90s, young urban professional. I wanted to be Chandler Bing in Friends, Mel Gibson in what Women Want, Christian Bale in American Psycho, Tom Hanks in Big. I didn't know what they did for a living, but all I knew was they didn't stink coming home from work, they dressed classy, dated hot babes, and had cool apartments in big cities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I was an aspiring student, I had so many dreams of finally working in a office job, after being dusty ass warehouse worker, dishwasher, fast food server for so many years. I used to walk around Times Square on early mornings when it was still dark, looking up at the Ernst and Young sign, praying that I'll be up there one day. My alarm clock was \"Fly me to the Moon\" by Frank Sinatra, not because I liked the song, but because it reminded of Bud Fox commuting into the city at the beginning of the movie Wall Street. I used to tear up at the end of Pursuit of Happyness, thinking that must be the greatest feeling in life to finally get the job, have a fancy office job where people will respect you. I thought life would be amazing - it would be hard work for sure, but manageable, doable, and coupled with a better lifestyle. I had so much drive and motivation - I looked forward to the day I could bring my pillow to sleep in the office, so I could brag to my dumb loser friends in my small hometown, that investment banking requires 80-100 hours per week, and only the strong can survive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was around 2017. Fast forward to today, I'm unemployed, have been fired from all my professional jobs that I've had, and have never been promoted. My main blame is that I started my career in accounting, thinking it was the hardest, driest, most boring of the business subjects. I took pride in understanding complex boring topics - I considered fun colorful business majors like marketing to be for people not smart enough for accounting or finance. Turns out, I sucked at my job, I hated my job, I hated the people at my job, my immediate team hated me because of this, and my confidence was tanked ever since. They would treat me like crap, and I had no defense because I was always skating on thin ice because of my subpar performance. I had nothing in common with any of them, they were socially conservative people who talk about the weather, their wife and kids, and football. They thought I was weird and resented me for being into eccentric things. \n\nEventually, I moved into B2B sales which I like much more, and I'm definitely better at, but still not where I want to be. Problem is, when I made the career move, 3 life events completely changed my mentality:\n\n\\-getting shit on by my accounting co-workers tanked my confidence\n\n\\-I turned 30\n\n\\-I experienced a bad injury \n\nTurning 30 meant that my dreams of being a cool young guy filled with piss and vinegar, the world at his feet, ready to grab life by the horns, to now, I'm a \"mister\" who now has grey hairs, seen as too old for the hot babes of NYC, too old for entry level jobs, less of a desire to work his ass off and make millions, lower testosterone so less drive and risk appetite.\n\nThe injury was even worse because the largest part of my confidence comes from my physical fitness. After being so excited to start B2B sales after leaving accounting, I completely bombed my first B2B sales job because I couldn't go to the gym, couldn't do my favorite hobbies, I was constantly in pain, seeing doctors, instead of focusing on doing my job well. On top of this, I suffered more debilitating injuries during the pandemic, and was unbelievably stressed with my living situation, so it affected my second sales job as well. (I'm mostly good now and rehabbed - but the psychological effect plus having aged 3-4 years has changed me)\n\nAnd my bad experience working in accounting made me feel like the dumbest person on earth. Some of my co-workers would joke about how the CPA is not even that hard, and can't understand why some people can't pass it. They constantly ragged on me, and the most annoying thing is that I'm used to blue collar work environments, where if men disrespect or get aggressive with other men, they do so with the understanding that they are liable for their words and may have to back it up. It was infuriating knowing that these dudes only had a pair of balls because I was the worst employee at the firm, and would never speak to me that way outside of the office context. But at the end of the day, I came in thinking I was smart, and left thinking I need to go back to wearing a hard hat and swinging a hammer in the sun.\n\nNow, I finally have some experience in my desired field, but because of my prior experiences, I find that I'm giving less of a shit that ever before about hitting it big in business, and living that dream yuppie life. I absolutely despise corporate slang, (\"to give you more color\", \"circle back\", can you \"ping\" me later, etc) don't care about stocks, don't want to read Zero to One anymore, I've lost my hunger. I remember seeing one of my former young co-workers getting all excited when we finally got the Bloomberg terminal installed in our office, because he was going to finally play with the toys that the big boys on wall street use. I was envious of the passion that he had, and remembered when I spent weekends studying to get my Bloomberg terminal certification, so happy to learn about anything about finance. I wish I could muster up that enthusiasm again, because it would not only make me happier, but it's very good to have in sales.\n\nMy question, have any of you guys gotten the passion back after losing it? I had an opportunity at a job that was absolutely perfect for me - it was working with the stock market, pitching to hedge funds, learning about finance. I would have killed for such a job back then. I wish I went straight to sales instead of trying to prove something by working in accounting (to show that I'm good with numbers I guess?). My lack of interest and passion shows in my performance, and I just want to be that bushy tailed young graduate again. So I'm here at reddit for maybe some advice or words of encouragement.\n\nTLDR:\n\n\\-OP was a starry eyed young student looking to work in some kind of fancy office job, any job that was considered smart and difficult\n\n\\-OP tried accounting, sucked at it, hated it, had all his confidence zapped from this experience\n\n\\-OP went to sales where he thought he'd do well, but a series of physical injuries zapped his confidence even further, and affected his work performance\n\n\\-OP has gotten to a pretty good place, B2B sales in fintech industry, which checks off all his \"sexy\" business job requirements, except he is now jaded and has lost motivation to be a fancy office guy. It's hard to even be motivated by money.\n\n\\-OP wants to turn the clock back and be the naive young guy again who used to listen to Warren Buffett interviews, read books on fundamental analysis, be hungry to consume all information on business. \n\n\\-OP seeks reddit's advice. Whether it's \"go learn a trade, you're too dumb for business\", or \"stay in sales but sell to a blue collar industry\" or \"watch this movie/TV show, it'll pump you up\" or a motivational story about taking several jobs to find the right company, and now life is excellent.",

    "text": "Quit and Travel or Secure a New Role and Sacrifice Travel? Am I too naive? Hi all,\n\nI currently work as a Senior Ecommerce Manager at a high achieving small business. I run the whole E-Commerce Department and consistently deliver results exceeding goals set by our CEO. The pay is good and my salary is currently at $80,000 plus a $20,000 guaranteed bonus at the end of the year. I get around 15% raises annually, for the past 3 years.\n\nI have become very unhappy with the job recently because I work 9-12 hours a day, have a micromanaging colleague, and no remote option with only 7 vacation days. The culture is very traditional and Eastern. It is toxic. I am the only American in this Taiwanese company.\n\nI have decided I want to quit. My plan is to quit next year by January 1st, 2024. Here is my dilemma - \n\n1. I will eventually need a new role. I have heard quitting a role without a new role lined up hurts your leverage in finding a new role. Also, the job market for E-Commerce is not good right now. There are a low amount of roles I am interested in on Indeed/Linkedin, and the pay is low.\n2. I need to see the world within the next year (this is something I planned since I was 21, and I am 26 now). I want to spend 2-3 months traveling Europe and Asia. However, finding a new job will likely take away my option to travel. \n3. I would like my new role to have higher compensation than my current role. But if I quit my job, I have a lower chance of this.\n4. I have a somewhat aggressive personal net worth goal to achieve by age 30, and the time value of my income is important to me.\n\nShould I quit my job and travel the world? Or should I find a new role before quitting my job, risking my option to travel the world? \n\nIs there any solution that can address the majority of my concerns? or am I simply being delusional? I am open to ideas as I am still somewhat young and want to learn from people with more life experience.\n\nThank you all in advance.",

I’ve been running this around in my head and keep coming to a dead end so I’m here asking for help. \n\nTo make a long story short, my husband and all of his siblings experienced terrible abuse and trauma growing up. They all have (or still do) struggled with depression, anxiety, insecurity, and feelings of worthlessness. \n\nThis is the most prominent in his brother “Glenn’s” life. He is stuck at a dead end job with no benefits, he can barely make his bills every month, he hasn’t had a partner or any significant friendships in who knows how long, and he has an almost crippling fear of talking because he’s worried every person will think he’s dumb/an idiot.\n\nWe’ve finally managed to convince Glenn to leave his tiny PNW town to come to stay with us in Texas. We are funding everything; moving expenses, a monthly allowance to live on, he won’t be expected to pay rent or get a job right away. We want to give him a truly fresh start. My husband and I have worked hard to get to where we are in life and we did it so we can help those we love when they need it. The only thing we expect Glenn to do shortly after getting here is to start therapy.\n\nWe want to help Glenn get a career job, not another dead end hourly job. We want him to be able to have a retirement, benefits, and a solid career path. Glenn is NOT an idiot, but his strengths don’t lie in sciences or maths. Our city is desperate for cops, and currently has a 10k signing bonus for anyone who gets through the academy. Technically, being a cop does check all these boxes.\n\nBut I would hate to throw Glenn from one toxic situation to another.  I’m sure I don’t need to point out the failings of American police, especially after the recent news about Tyre Nichols. My husband thinks this is the best and only path for his brother, and I really can’t think of another option, but I’m not thrilled with the idea of him becoming cop.\n\nAre there any other options for someone like Glenn? He only has a high school education and I think he barely passed that.\n\nTl;dr are there any other options for a career for someone with little education and (at least currently) crippling anxiety?",

I had just  pushed a feature that was performing successfully and passed QA without a problem.

For context, I haven't actually messed up so far in the company, but he's a really volatile boss. \n\nI confronted him after the meeting, settled the design problem first and then told him I didn't think that was appropriate and warranted.

Problem was that the event had a lot of people shook and talks about company culture were being brought up all the time. Although that was good, the boss started taking it out on me and I couldn't stomach it, so I collected my March paycheck and sent in my resignation.

I did both my BSc. and MSc. in the Netherlands, and after graduating I, like many of you, struggled for many months to find work. I started a job a few months ago at a Dutch company, and I thought I'd share some comparisons and differences for you all, whether you're considering studying abroad or even trying to find work abroad. \n\nSome high-level notes:\n\n- I had about 1 YoE if you include an internship + 1.5 years of part-time experience at a company during grad school.\n- My title is Data Engineer but my specialty is data science, particularly deep learning and time series forecasting.\n- I work \"40 hours a week\" but in reality I'm completely flexible, so long as I get my work done. I know that many in my team work closer to 32-36 hour weeks, though they're not explicit about it (at least not with me). My manager works 40-50 hour weeks but he's an excellent programmer who seemingly really enjoys his job, and he claims he just works on weekends because he wants to. He's unmarried and in his 30's, though.\n- My total compensation is €4500/mo, 14x per year. It's very common in NL to get a \"13th month\" which is essentially a free extra month of pay after 12 months of employment. Depending on company, it happens in either May or November. Additionally, I get paid two full months of pay in December. As such, the total compensation is 4500 x 14 = €63000,  or about $66,500. I do not get any stock as the company is privately held.\n- The company pays for 100% of my commute, either via public transit or the gas I spend driving a vehicle (I don't own a car)\n- I get 25 days paid vacation with 1 extra paid vacation day per quarter that I don't get sick, but I've been told that it's essentially \"unlimited\" vacation so long as you don't screw anyone over and are doing good work. Many senior individuals in this company get closer to 40 days, they've told me the company ramps up PTO quickly with seniority. \n- Our company is officially \"3 in-person, 2 remote\" but in reality its more like 1 in-person, 4 remote. Depends on the team member. I prefer in-person more than remote, but some days I just wake up late or it's raining hard and I don't feel like going to the office. Nobody cares at all.\n- The company has about 3000 employees, but it's not a tech company. Every product we create is exclusively internal.\n- We are agile in 2-week sprints. \n\nand my favorite:\n\n- If I get sick, the first 2 weeks I get 100% of my pay. Weeks 3-52 (yes, fifty two) I get 90% of my pay. Weeks 53-208 I get 80% of my pay. After 4 years of being sick and unable to work, I have to go onto a government program. I cannot be fired for not being able to work if I get sick or injured. \n\n---\n\nHaving most of my American friends and family in similar fields (engineering of some kind) I hear just awful things about almost everyone's companies. Dismissive managers, 10-15 days paid vacation per year, grindset mentality with strict supervision on hours, micromanaging everything, and having to be on-call or otherwise getting calls after hours, I definitely don't feel like I'm missing out compared to the States. I make about 25%-50% less than I'd make in the US (depending on city) but I can pay all of my bills and save at least €1000/mo while living a very comfortable lifestyle, and my \"emergency fund\" doesn't really have to be that big because:\n\n- I cannot get fired or laid off except in very dire circumstances (some discussion in the comments about this, but employment is not at-will here).\n- I basically cannot get evicted if I'm unable to pay due to work/health issues, so I'll never be homeless. \n- My medical bills will never be above €385/year because that's the annual deductible for my health insurance policy that covers 100% of everything, everywhere.\n- I don't ever need to own a car, and even if I want to I can get a free car through my job, which is common in NL, so I will never be cut off from work due to a car malfunction issue. \n\nI don't think I'll stay here forever, but I definitely feel like I could do several more years here at least before thinking about returning to the USA. I've always enjoyed the Dutch vibe and the more relaxed attitude people have here, but at some point my earning potential will likely just be much higher in the States once I am a bit more experienced, so who knows how I'll feel in a few years.",

It's _extremely_ hard to fire someone here unless 1) they did something obviously bad/illegal or 2) the company's survival is at stake and they can actually prove that unless they lay people off they'll go out of business.\n\nWhen I read or hear stories online or from friends/acquaintances, it seems like the smallest mistake or even talking back to your manager is enough to get you fired. Some of my friends have also claimed that the high American salary is sometimes not worth the unstable employment status.\n\nAs someone who would like to eventually work in the US, this is a little concerning to me.

    "text": "Should I leave a job I really like for a chance at career advancement? The situation;\nI'm working at the moment with 1.5 YOE at a very big bank. A recruiter earlier reached out to me for an interview, and I have made it to the final round of interviews at a large American investment firm. \n\nI'm trying to decide, if I do manage to receive the offer, if this current job climate is right for taking this sort of role. This takes place in Canada where the market seems to be faring worse than that in America. \n\nFor context;\n\nTC:\nMy current TC ~90K but my manager has said he will be recommending me for promotion. This is 85k base 5k bonus. \n\nThe TC at the fund will be significantly higher at 125k; 110k base with a potential 15k bonus depending on the funds performance and mine. And the pay bump from Junior to a higher level is more significant than at the bank.\n\nHowever, my main concern aside from the factors listed below is the prospect of being let go prior to obtaining 3 yoe. I am somewhat unfamiliar with SWE roles at hedge funds but I imagine they are volatile based on the firms performance. Big banks historically have very stable positions and my position at the moment seems very secure. \n\nThe 3 YOE will make it possible for me to be comfortably in the intermediate developer range and is also necessary for me to work in America in the future. Both will significantly improve my hireability. \n\n\n**more info**\nThe work;\n\nWhat I love about my current job is the autonomy and breadth. We create internal tools used by developers and I've gotten the chance to work with a lot of tech and build a lot of cool things. Aside from my awesome coworkers this is the favorite aspect of my job. \n\nAt the fund, I'm going to be working on a variety of trading systems in a much more focused back end role. They seem to have a more rigorous engineering team and the work seems challenging and interesting. Building trading systems that deal with immense throughput and concurrency challenges seems like it would stretch my skills as an engineer even more than my current job.\n\nWork life balance;\nMy current job wlb is basically perfect. Aside from when there is the occasional delivery sprint or production issue, overtime work is completely up to me. They are also really liberal with time off and understanding of life situations. \n\nAt the fund, based on my research online, a common criticism is that you are expected to work a lot more. Many engineers have commented about having to work weekends consistently and an overall aggressive work culture. Also based on online reviews it seems many people have commented about a toxic work culture in teams, and political challenges working with traders as SWE. \n\nI already have a personality that is oriented towards working hard (evenings, weekends), and the bank gives me the flexibility to do that without the pressure of expecting it.",

    "text": "How do I start over at 35 in software engineering? My background: I graduated in STEM from a well-known North American university and currently living on the West Coast. Upon graduation, I immediately started a SaaS start-up with a close friend. I serve as the CTO and my friend CEO. I self-learnt web development and developed the product all by myself for a few years before we raised enough money to hire more employees. Gradually, I transitioned towards a leadership role rather than coding. I'd be responsible for hiring senior devs and managers, participating in high-level product decisions, and generally help everyone solve problems in coding, UX/UI, delivery processes. I am still coding once in a while, but I don't have enough time to get really deep into anything new. After a little more than a decade, we grew it to a sizeable company of around 50 people and recently sold it to a large investment firm.\n\nThe parent firm already signalled that they wanted us gone ASAP so they could install their own management. I also think it's a good time for me to move on to a new venture anyway. But I'm having a hard time deciding what to do next. My whole adult life has always been with my start-up and I don't think I've ever applied for any full-time job before, besides a few internships in college. I will list a few thoughts here hoping someone could help me process them.\n\n\\- My earn-out from the sale was decent and enough to sustain myself for quite awhile, but it's nowhere near enough to live comfortably while being unemployed.\n\n\\- My friend already wanted to jump on a new start-up with me. But tbh, the ideas of sleepless nights and financial uncertainties don't appeal to me as much now as in my 20s. In the case I do start a new start-up, I want to invest my own money this time instead of raising VC money. So I need to conserve my fund.\n\n\\- I can apply for a smaller role in another firm, maybe a senior software dev? This allows me less stress responsibility-wise while still having a decent pay so I don't have to eat into my fund. It also gives me time to develop myself technically and find ideas for my next startup. But does it look bad that a CTO's next job is going backward to a dev role?\n\n\\- I can also do a lateral move to a management role in another firm. Maybe a VP or Director of Engineering? This will obviously make the job-search process more rigorous and the job itself will be quite stressful again. But the pay will be much better and it will look better on my resume.\n\n\\- I can also go back to school? Maybe a Master in AI or ML. I never had a chance to study properly in university because of money. I had to take random courses to work and graduated very early. Also going back to school is a good excuse to have some gap years in my resume while starting a new start-up.\n\n\\- I've always been a more product-focused CTO rather than a technical one. I've always considered coding a tool to solve problems, and learned them as I needed. I think I lack deep understanding of many programming disciplines such as languages, best practices, Dev Op, etc... I only knew what to use to solve what problems come my way. I'm good at understanding business needs and develop the right products, and lead people to collaborate on them. Knowing this, I'm not sure which role will suit me in the \"real\" world.\n\nI'm open to advice and criticism. Please feel free to let me know what you think, good or bad (:",

    "text": "Feeling desperate while looking for a junior job Hi all! I'm currently looking for a job right now in Computer Science in the Madrid (Spain) area.  \n\n\nFirst, some context: I have a BS in Computer Engineering (Ingeniería Informática), and some work experience: an internship of 4 months at a consulting company working for the defense and space sectors, and a full-time job 9 months at an American communications company founded in California as a startup. I was laid off on my last job since my company is one of these big US software companies that had hired like crazy during the pandemic, so I've had no job since May. No problem, I thought, since I wanted to take the opportunity to enroll on an intensive Swedish course during the summer (I wanted to learn the language). So, I started looking for a job in September.  \n\n\nWell, I've already applied to around 60 offers, and been rejected from all of them barring a few where the process is still ongoing (at least I got pretty far in 5 of them). I've started to feel I am doing something really wrong, and I don't know what it is exactly.\n\n  \nI've been told to apply to positions where my profile fits the job description even if I don't have enough experience, but that doesn't seem to have worked at all (never tried to apply to Senior positions at least). I try to apply to entry level positions, but sometimes it feels like I should apply for an internship again instead. Furthermore, I've also tried to apply to embedded software positions because low-level coding interests me a lot, but maybe my relevant work experience is not enough (I only worked at a Raspberry Pi robot once at university). I would apply for backend development since that was the role I had at my previous company, but I worked on a C, C++ and Rust server that implemented WebRTC, something that might be too strange, since almost no one does web stuff in low-level languages (except maybe in IoT, but again, I have little experience in embedded software). On the other hand, I thought I could be valuable as a junior SRE, but I haven't really worked that much in cloud infrastructure (I've only worked indirectly with Kafka and BigQuery).  \n\n\nSo, I don't know what to do. Is the market that hard right now for junior developers? Should I abandon the job search and focus on developing new skills? Which ones? If it is of any help, I'm interested in low-level programming (embedded, compilers, operative systems…), cloud software (managing cloud infrastructure mostly I think), and also backend but not as much.\n\n  \nAny tips? Thank you!\n\n  \nP.S.: I can send a link to my current CV if someone is curious, it explains better which skills I have.",

    "text": "Lessons learned in 3 years of consulting I never really wanted to be a consultant so going to a big 4 company  was a huge step for me which I don’t regret at all and I count the 3 years I was there as some of the most impactful of my career. Just like many of you I learn by doing not book learning. Being ADHD and Dyslexic I see the world a little different than others. As a Solution Architect and Security information and Event Management lead it was a natural role for me as it utilized how I see Data as it ingresses, egress and moves lateral in a modern Ecosystem and how to implement it into some of the largest Data Networks in the world which was amazing and truly fulfilling. Like I told them when they hired me “My oath did not have a expiration date, even though I retired I still want to serve!” And they let me do that.\n\nBeing a data guy and a Vet I am a copious Note taker and wanted to share some rules I learned over the last 3 years.\n\n**Character is important:** We live in a world where every word is recorded, misinterpreted and lawyers go over every legal agreement and statement of work to make sure both parties are protected. To me I took a simpler approach “I give you my word that my team and I will help you” and so I did. I did not care about the white noise of the world but focused on keeping my word as that was their expectation of our services. At a certain point all the consultanting companies are the same so the clients just wanted to have confidence that we will do what we say and keep our word. Honor and Integrity are not concepts to be pulled out when they need something to be negotiated but are core to who we are as people and the company we represent. Do what you say and say what you do. Keep it simple. \n\n**Listen First, Talk Last:** The people I met were some of the best in the world. Day in and day out they are in the thick of the storm fighting the good fight. When they want to employ a consultant usually they have already figured out the solution but just needs us to validate or execute it as they are still in the storm fighting. I always told my folks “we are like the Coast Guard and they are the leaky boat in the hurricane. We fly in and help them patch their boats, give them a new motor, help them with their navigation to realign them to a true North Framework then we head to the beach for Mai Tais and volleyball until called again but they stay in the storm hopefully with a better boat then when we arrived.” They are always in the storm so listening first and understanding their challenges will help us integrate and help them with their challenges as we bring industry insight to them to hopefully stop them from bailing water all the time.\n\n**Lead, Don’t Manage:** This is ingrained in every NCO (Noncommissioned Officer) from day one. We are only as good as the people we work with. In a world where loyalty is based on the Fiscal year and the greener, shiner object across the street by leading your people and truly showing them that you are there for them they will work for you and stay with you and not be tempted by the grass is greener on the other side of the street. I am truly proud that I had one of the lowest attrition rates and a huge success rate while I was at EY but very little was me but my team pulling together as a team. Forgetting the normal politics and focusing on being part of the solution. Harry Truman once said “You can get a lot of things done if you don’t try to take credit.” They emphasized this on a grand scheme, and they all knew I was available 24/7 if they needed me and if need be I would jump in front of the bus for them over and over again as that is what a leader does. Managers just look at the team as assets and resources to be discarded when done. A leader Drives the team to become a team and think beyond themselves and protects each and everyone of them so they can accomplish their goals and live their passion in their chosen profession.\n\n**It takes a Village, Not a villager:** One of the earliest and most heartfelt lessons I ever learned was EGO is the destroyer. I can truthfully say there was not one day I did not learn something from my team and the people I came into contact with. When I look at a global Ecosystem / network it is a like a symphony to me. I can hear if the drums are to loud or the horns are out of tune or if there is a rogue soloist trying to make a name for themselves. They all come together in my brain but the crux is there is order in the chaos and you cannot have a symphony / great work of music if everyone is not doing what they are supposed to be doing. Very quickly as people align to the same page the music comes from being discordant to a thing of beauty and amazement. No single person can do it alone. The maestro is nothing without the orchestra. Everyday you can learn something new and everyone has a place in the digital symphony we call a data network.\n\n**Remove Fear:** Frank Herbert really nailed how to deal with Fear in dune; it is the “mind-killer” and in a modern organization it can be disastrous to the enterprise. Fear has no place when data is the truth. In the military we used to say “We trust but we validate” When lives are on the line we don’t guess and we don’t make decisions in fear as it will cost lives. In the modern world remove fear and focus on character and data. Data is truth and character will guide you. There can neve be a situation where you fear for your job or not telling the client or boss “Truth”. The world around us deals in “fake News” we don’t. We focus on the data and we “KNOW” before we elevate or recommend. We never shirk from our roles as the data gods as truth is our watch word and the foundation of who we are. Fear is the mind-killer and in a job where we are paid to think, fear is nothing more than an anchor that will weigh you down and prevent you from being the best you are able, when ever you are able. \n\n**The right Skillset to the right role to the right outcome**: The world of a modern Ecosystem is a diverse as the stars in the sky and everyone has a different skillset supporting their roles to drive revenue for the business. We should always strive to understand the skills to accomplish a task and never try to shove a person into a role that that they don’t have the skills to accomplish the outcome or the role assigned. In SOCOM we are surgical when we build a team and understand every skillset and the strengths that guide those skillsets to the mission outcome. Everyone has a role to play and every skillset feeds that to the ultimate outcome. In the modern ecosystem we should learn these skillsets and roles to support. \n\n**Be Honest and Authentic at all times:** So many times people told me I was known for being “authentic and honest” and I enjoyed that but it ultimately led me down the thought pattern “well what are others doing.” So many people put on a face for a client or change who they are for the company they support. Stop it! The clients don’t want that and you don’t want that. What is the point of reaching the end of the race if you lost yourself in the race. Be you. You are knowledgeable and know right from wrong just speak your truth and it will work out. Usually people will respect you more for it than just being another person on a call. I remember one time I got feedback from a client “I don’t remember everyone else on the call, but I remember the guy with the hat and the swords, He really got it and understood our challenges.” (for those who don’t know I have a collection of swords on my office wall and I always wear a ballcap, it is me.) Never be afraid to be yourself (unless you are narcissistic Asshat than maybe you should get into another line of work and a different viewpoint of the world.)\n\nI have other lessons but these were the ones on top of my mind. A very long time ago a great friend of mine (was my XO at the time and now 30+ years later still my friend) gave me a book “About Face, The Odssey of an American Warrior” written by Col David Hackworth. I was a young man when I read it and one of the biggest lessons I learned from that book was he used to carry a green book and in it he would write things are good that he saw in leadership and things that were bad. I did that for 20 years of military service and I continue today in the private sector. These are my lessons that I learned and are not meant for any individual or company but life lessons that I reflected on as I continue my Journey outside of consulting (went Vendor specific). They are not meant to change anyone’s mind or call anyone out (legal disclaimer in the world we live in) but merely sharing my wisdom on my journey. Remember it takes a village and my village is the world as we all have a part to play in it and we are better together, being alone only finds you wandering in the dark screaming for help. (alone does not mean not being a individual for those who choose to pick apart my words.",

    "text": "UPDATE: Law Schools Begin Discussions with Law Firms After Open Letter on Antisemitism (American Lawyer) [https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2023/11/13/law-schools-begin-discussions-with-law-firms-after-open-letter-on-antisemitism/](https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2023/11/13/law-schools-begin-discussions-with-law-firms-after-open-letter-on-antisemitism/)\n\nWhile not commenting publicly, some T14 or New York-based law schools have been in discussions with law firms about preventing further incidents of antisemitism on campus, sources say.\n\nNovember 13, 2023 at 05:30 AM\n\nChristine Charnosky  \nDan Roe\n\nEditor’s Note: Since this article was initially published, sources have said law firm leaders and law school deans have met in person, had discussions about the open letter or are planning meetings in the near term. The story has been updated to reflect the ongoing dialogue.\n\nAfter more than 200 law firms urged law school deans in an open letter to condemn and prevent incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia on campus, law schools generally remained publicly silent on the issue, but sources say talks between schools and firms are starting to happen.\n\nA handful of law school deans told [Law.com](https://Law.com) that their schools were already committed to protecting students from hate speech and acts of harassment and violence. Some deans also said they were unclear on the next steps of the letter, which closed by asking the law schools to open up a “respectful dialogue” with law firms on the issue.\n\nNo school officially reported to [Law.com](https://Law.com) that it was contacted by any law firm to discuss the letter further. However, sources at law firms confirmed discussions are ongoing between some schools and law firms.\n\nAccording to one source, an Am Law 25 firm held a meeting for several firm leaders to meet with the dean of Harvard Law. Other meetings have reportedly taken place or are being scheduled with law school deans at Columbia, Yale and others, according to sources.\n\nKatten Muchin Rosenman managing partner Noah Heller said he has traded emails with Fordham School of Law Dean Matthew Diller, who updated Heller on how the law school has been responding. Heller said he and Diller are seeking to arrange a time to meet and discuss how they can work together. Diller did not respond to a request seeking comment.\n\nRepresentatives for those top 14 schools and others that received the letter have not responded to multiple [Law.com](https://Law.com) requests for comment on their discussions with law firms, or they have declined to comment.\n\nBefore the firms’ letter was sent, many law schools had already begun posting statements denouncing discrimination and harassment, such as the one Dean Gillian Lester sent to the Columbia Law School community a day before the law firms’ letter.\n\n“There is no place for hate at Columbia Law School,” Lester wrote in her Oct. 31 letter, provided to [Law.com](https://Law.com) by a law school spokesperson. “We must stand together against bigotry wherever it exists, including holding accountable the individual who used a hateful antisemitic epithet toward a Jewish member of our community last week,” adding that a disciplinary process is underway.\n\nIn a Thursday letter to members of the “Harvard community,” Harvard University president Claudine Gay condemned antisemitism and noted that a recently formed advisory group would address the roots of antisemitism in the community.\n\n“The advisory group will work closely with me, guided by Provost Alan Garber and with the help of the school deans, to develop a robust strategy for confronting antisemitism on campus,” Gay said. “We do not condone—and will not ignore—antisemitism, Islamophobia, acts of harassment or intimidation, or threats of violence.”\n\nOverall, there is a consensus that it doesn’t seem in the schools’ best interest to comment on the law firm letter publicly, according to law school sources. However, some school officials were also confused about what the law firms were requesting law schools to do.\n\n“Of course, we join the law firms in condemning antisemitism and Islamophobia,” Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, told [Law.com](https://Law.com) Tuesday, adding, “I am not sure, though, what the letter is asking the law schools to do.”\n\nRegardless, “the law schools that received this joint letter will pay attention to it,” Jim Rosenblatt, dean emeritus of Mississippi College School, said. Indeed, some law school donations depend on Big Law-organized fundraising events and partners’ fundraising.\n\n“What will grab the attention of these law schools in a more immediate and profound way is the reaction of large financial donors to activities and events that take place at the law school,” Rosenblatt continued. “For that reason, it is a given that law schools will make public statements and take other actions designed to provide assurances that the law schools do not permit ‘discrimination or harassment.’”\n\nRosenblatt also said it is likely that the law firms that signed the letter will continue to hire students from these schools on an individual basis, although the students may be questioned during the recruitment process about their actions as law students.\n\nWhile the letter was sent mostly to top law schools and New York-based law schools, many other law school deans heard of the letter in the national press.\n\nSchool Efforts\n\nSome school officials underscored that they were already committed to an environment free from hatred.\n\nBerkeley Law trains students to be professional, Chemerinsky said, but he added, “We support the right of all students to express their views.”\n\nDavid Meyer, president and Joseph Crea dean of Brooklyn Law School, on Monday wrote in a letter, obtained by [Law.com](https://Law.com), to Sullivan & Cromwell senior chair Joseph C. Shenker, “I welcome the sentiment expressed in the letter and wish to assure you that Brooklyn Law School fully shares the objectives expressed there.”\n\nIn his letter, Meyer shared messages he has shared with the Brooklyn Law School community, including one he sent on Oct. 23, calling on the community “to denounce and reject the poisons of antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hatred.”\n\n“Brooklyn Law School is committed to a learning environment free from hatred and to preparing our graduates for successful leadership in the highest ranks of the profession,” Meyer wrote.\n\nLaw Firms Get Involved\n\nBeyond writing the letter, some leading U.S. law firms have sought other ways to influence the discourse on college campuses and at law schools. This includes addressing incidents of harassment and violence against pro-Israel and pro-Palestine demonstrators.\n\nIn addition to signing the letter, organized by Sullivan & Cromwell, law firms such as Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and Morgan, Lewis & Bockius have partnered with pro-Israel organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League, Hillel International and Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law to operate a helpline for Jewish students experiencing antisemitism on campus.\n\n“This is squarely in our tradition of using our platform and our talent to assist people who are being marginalized or discriminated against in our country,” Gibson Dunn partner Orin Snyder said about the helpline. While Gibson Dunn would be open to representing Muslim students experiencing Islamophobia, Snyder said, the current helpline is not set up to assist them.\n\nMeanwhile, Kasowitz Benson Torres is preparing civil rights lawsuits against an unspecified number of colleges and universities in response to incidents of antisemitism that the firm is cataloging, partner Mark Ressler told The American Lawyer.\n\n“We are going to proceed under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and we are going to show that universities were acutely aware of the treatment of Jewish students on campus and engaged in deliberate indifference toward the situation in violation of their Title VI obligations,” Ressler said. “They failed to promptly, adequately and concretely implement remedial measures to eliminate the hostile educational environment, stop the harassment and ensure the harassment doesn’t recur.”\n\nBefore last week’s letter from Big Law, firms such as Winston & Strawn and Davis Polk & Wardwell rescinded job offers from law students over statements on the conflict and their association with pro-Palestine student groups.",

    "text": "Y'all are going to do great at finals. Here's some tips (3.8 GPA, LLM, T10) This is going to be my last post in this sub and it'll be some advice as you head into finals season. Y'all give me second-hand anxiety from reading this sub (I swear to G-d y'all need to touch grass) and I think it's time to move on. I went to a T10 for my JD and graduated 10 years ago. Now, I'm at a T10 in my second year of getting an LLM, so I have some experience.\n\n**Touch Grass:**  I am an elected official. I also have a full time job and a busy personal life. I am determined not to sacrifice any of those during finals season and I still get good grades. **My point is time management and avoiding burnout are key to success.** 1L's, you are in a unique position to fail at both because you haven't done this before and people are screaming at you that 1L grades are so important. You can't let these people get to you. Take this seriously. But if you need to take an hour or two a day to do nothing, watch a TV show, see a movie, do that. If you don't, you'll be like me 1L year - burnt out, staring at a Civ Pro exam, unable to translate the concepts you've learned onto the page because your brain has turned to mush.\n\n**Outlines:** I don't have much to add here. Everyone talks about outlines. It's the end of November, which means you've already started your outlines. If you're a 1L, I cannot stress enough that you need to create your own outlines. If you haven't finished your outlines, that's okay. Don't stress, don't try to measure up to what other people are doing. I tend to finish mine two to three days before my first final. I'm not going to regurgitate the usual advice I'll just note what helped me succeed the most:  I try to figure out what the Prof cares about and connect my answers to that. When I'm in class, the only things I write are blurbs about  what the Prof cares about that I can integrate into the exam and the essential points of cases (elements, rules, etc.), everything else is noise. Once I'm done dissecting the elements, applying the rules to the facts, and providing a rationale to my conclusion, I figure out how I can tie any of those things or frame them in ways that pander to the Prof's viewpoints or relate to the issues the Prof cares about.\n\n**Papers**:  There's almost no advice on law school papers in this sub because people are so obsessed with 1L grades. In my experience at two different top schools students don't tend to take papers seriously. This is a mistake - one of my papers in law school led me to getting my first job. The papers I've done for my LLM degree have helped me develop relationships with Professors, due to their quality and I fully intend to utilize those relationships for my career.\n\n**The goal is to create a great paper without spending more time than necessary to achieve that goal and without sacrificing exam study time.** It's December so you already have a topic (hopefully). I've gotten an A in every paper class I've taken for my JD and my LLM and I have the same formula - pick three topics I'm passionate about two months in the semester, meet with the Professor, determine which one he or she is most passionate about of those three, and write about that topic. I don't work on the paper usually during the semester. I just do a little bit of research but nothing more.\n\nI create a short outline of the paper prior to starting my outlines for exams, write the introduction and conclusion, gather a majority of my sources, and leave it alone until I'm done with exams. I might spit out a paragraph or two or add more sources but I heavily deprioritize it. It gives me time to think deeply about the topic. Then, I spend the days between the exam period ending and the paper period ending - usually one to three days - writing it all out. I try to spit at all of it out in one day and then spend one day refining. And that's it. A lot of students don't spend time thoughtfully picking a topic or just try to outline and do all of it in the same few days. That saves time but it means you can't be thoughtful.\n\n**Grades: Your grades don't have to set your career path.** Some of you are going to work you butts off and get B's. Some of you are going to work harder than you ever have and be at the bottom of the class. Recognize that when it comes to grades you aren't fully in control of your destiny - if the person next to does a banger job, maybe that knocks you down a bit. If January comes around and you were in the position I was in as a 1L (at the bottom), don't get down about it. Accept your situation and try to specialize in one area of law and aggressively network. It worked out very well for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Caveats/why you should maybe ignore me:** My first semester in the LLM program my classes were mostly international students, at least half. For obvious reasons, that skewed grades in my favor. This year, it's almost all American law students and my lowest grade is still an A-. Still, something to consider when weighing this. If you care, I bottomed out in law school until my last semester, when I got A's (I cracked the code too late). And finally, I have ten years of post-graduate legal experience so I am not the ordinary LLM student.",

    "text": "Systemic Racism is Real. My unfortunately racist and homophobic hotel experience in Montreal. Hi Everyone!\n\n\nI really need some advice as I still feel pretty shaken up. \n\n\nTo give you guys some background:\n\n\nMy brother and I were doing a small college road trip and decided to stay in Montreal on our way home. My brother and I are both black americans with dreadlocks. I identify as queer and I had specially designed rainbow nails 🌈\n\n\nOnce we arrived in Montreal we used a third party provider to book our stay. We check in and everything seems fine. Valet is amazing and they even gave us a free upgrade! Our experience was going well until we decided to extend our stay. That's when things took a turn for the worst.\n\n\nThe manager, a middle-aged white woman who spoke at least three languages, seemed nice enough. I hadn't thought much about her when I saw her at the front desk. We let her know that we wanted to extend our stay and she said of course. It wasn't until she looked down at her screen that her entire demeanor changed.\n\n\n She mentioned that we were given a free upgrade and looked appalled. She said that we would have to pay for the upgrade moving forward and we were fine with that. She typed something into the system and said we needed to scan our credit card again so that they could put another 250-dollar hold on our account for incidentals. Okay, inconvenient but understandable.\n\n\nAfter we scanned our card I couldn't tell if she needed anything else because she went silent and stopped interacting with us. I asked if she needed anything else from us and she dismissively shrugged her shoulders, put her hands up, and said \"I don't know.\" We thanked her and she responded with an insincere thank you.\n\n\nTo make a long story shorter our hotel stay concluded with this hotel manager directing the front desk staff, bellhop, and valet to withhold our belongings and vehicle until we gave them our credit card for a third time at checkout. Even though they had already placed multiple holds on our card totaling 500 dollars and it was still reflected on our online banking statement. \n\n\n By the end of our stay both my brother and I felt afraid and unwelcomed. I think the manager specifically directed her staff to make our stay unpleasant. We felt bullied by the hotel staff.\n\n\nAfter we checked out, one of the managers (who was a white man) asked me about my stay. Usually I'm too afraid to speak up but I was honest and told him that my experience was rude and racist outside of the stellar treatment I received from valet. He told me that my experience wasn't the only one and that this has happened to multiple other guests. He said that he personally has spoken with upper management about it but they refuse to do anything.\n\n\nI don't want this to happen to other families but this problem appears to be systemic and I don't know if there is any way that I can bring about real change. I need your advice ladies 🙏🏿❤️ What should I do?\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: Thank you all so much for your support ❤️❤️ I definitely will see who I can contact in corporate. I was afraid to say the name but I hate feeling like I have to keep others comfortable even when they have no regard for my own comfort. \n\nUpdate #2: You all are so amazing 😭 Thank you for validating my feelings. I'm sorry I haven't responded to everyone yet. Since you all have been so amazing I want to be vulnerable with you guys. My mental health has been suffering a bit after this. I've just been on edge and anxious. I keep going between anger and feeling helpless. I'm going to talk to my therapist. But I was embarrassed that I wasn't over everything the next day. Just taking some time for me ❤️❤️❤️ You all are truly so supportive! Thank you so much 🫂\n\n\n\nThe hotel is the InterContinental Montreal, an IHG Hotel ✨\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a list of some of the microaggressions I experienced during my stay: (unfortunately, my instincts were right. I already had a strong sense of unease after the first microaggression and it meant that something worse was ahead)\n\n\n\n- While waiting at the hotel restaurant to order a soda my brother was told \"You know this isn't free right?\" we were then told that we couldn't charge it to our room because they didn't know if our card would work.\n\n\n- Security started banging on our door at 10:58 pm Sunday night to let us know that we needed to turn our TV down.  We were watching cartoon network at level 27 out of at least 60-something volume levels. I'm not even sure if their we're other guests staying in the rooms next to us and a curfew wasn't mentioned or posted anywhere visible.\n\n\n- I couldn't sleep the night that they sent security up to our room and I started reading more of their online reviews. Unsurprisingly, the hotel has a history of racist and homophobic profiling as well as assaulting hotel guests of color.\n\n\n- Someone was sent to knock on our door at 11:57 am to let us know that we needed to check out and had 5 more minutes. The posted check-out time was 12 noon.\n\n\n- A member of housekeeping admitted to going through our personal items and throwing away a bag with my brother's art supplies and antique coins because they thought it was trash. We went to them directly because we didn't want to put her job at risk. She kept nervously laughing and made it seem like we were inconveniencing her before she brought it up to the front desk.\n\n\n- A hotel member at the front desk said that they would comp our breakfast and 1 day's parking for throwing away our belongings but they still sent someone to knock on our door about payment. They also called us afterwards because they thought the manager only directed them to cover two breakfast items and not our full breakfast.\n\n\n- When we ordered dinner they also sent someone to knock on the door afterwards and called us to collect payment. We asked them to charge it to the room when we ordered. \n\n\n \n\n\nTLDR: I experienced prejudice on nearly every level of service interaction I had at one of the largest globally recognized hotel chains in the world. I believe I was targeted as a queer black woman with dreadlocks. (I literally had specially done rainbow nails too). I believe the woman responsible for this treatment is the manager of the hotel and I found out that this hotel has a history of profiling and assaulting guests of color. I don't want this to happen to anyone else and I'm not sure how to proceed. This problem appears to be systemic, so is there any way for me to make a difference?",

    "text": "Workplace advice? Hi y’all! I’ve been ruminating on something and I’d like some objective input.\n\nI am a black/indigenous American femme who works at a nonprofit. Recently, we had a conference that required carpooling and staying at a hotel. One of my coworkers that carpooled in my car misplaced her bag with both her laptops, wallet and other items at the venue during set up and when she asked me about it (mind you the entire staff was in a conference room at the hotel eating food that I couldn’t eat) I was in my room with another (black femme) coworker and my mother (who was volunteering for the weekend) doing some last minute training on time sensitive tasks for the following morning. I told her that I specifically saw her bag sitting behind one of the booths that we set up all day and that it could have been left at the venue but because I could not break away, for her to go back to the staff room to announce her bag missing and to ask staff if they saw it or knew if it got accidentally packed up. \n\n10 minutes later, my other co-worker (the event manager; I am the operations coordinator of our org) came to my room. My mom answered the door and I could hear my coworker asking if she could search our room. My mom said that was completely uncomfortable and turned her away. My other coworker that was in the room immediately mentioned how icky that made her feel but I was so exhausted after working overtime for weeks and still needing to get more work done that I just compartmentalized it and kept moving.\n\nThis particular coworker (event manager) was disrespectful and dismissive several times during the duration of the project, even to the point where I had to have 2 separate conversations about how frustrated I was with our communication and I had even heard from coworkers that she had taken credit for someone my work. After reading post conference analysis it also appears that other black coworkers acknowledged unsavory behavior from her; all subversive so it’s hard to peg concrete evidence other than her trying to search my room. (Mind you the bag was found first thing in the morning and no one apologized to me)\n\nI reported this instance to our 3rd party HR and it has been 3weeks with no direct resolution. Should I talk to my direct supervisor about this? It’s a new service we are using so I thought they would be a bit more aggressive on getting matters like this handled, especially since both of the contractors are also black women… or am I making a bigger deal out of a generally bitchy coworker? \n\nI’d be happy to give more context but any insight is appreciated!",

    "text": "Male privilege is a myth in Muslim countries, too, and here's why: **Afghanistan**\n\n*Trafficking*\n\nWell here's an interesting fact: [boys are more likely in Afghanistan to be trafficked than girls](https://hagarinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hagar-Research-Forgotten-No-More-Male-Child-Trafficking-in-Afghanistan.pdf). They can be subjected to sexual trafficking, forced labor or being sent off as a soldier (a loophole due to the country's absence of conscription). For example, boys often age 13 and under often were sexually trafficked into Bacha Bazi or \"boy play\", which was a custom where young boys were forced into entertainment where they danced or sang sexually as male entertainers for adult men and were raped repeatedly by their captors and his friends. At least 50 percent of sexual exploitation in Afghanistan was bacha bazi, and it often crossed lines into forced labor. Boys age 13 and under were most likely to be sexually exploited, and because Afghan girls were banned from sexual work and entertainment because they were seen as child-bearers and homemakers, [Afghan boys were picked as a substitute for sexual gratification](https://76crimes.com/2021/10/21/sex-trafficking-of-boys-contributed-to-taliban-victory-in-afghanistan/), being seen as a substitute for women. As a result, the people raping them saw them as a fake woman and didn't consider themselves gay for raping them. Taliban opposed Bacha Bazi but American-backed Afghan leaders practiced it and American forces ignored it. This led to support towards Taliban from families of victims and others opposed to the practice. The boys were made to dress in feminine attire and were released as soon as they grew beards. Many powerful Afghan men supported the practice because they believed women are for children and boys are for sexual gratification.\n\nBoys are more likely to be trafficked in Afghanistan than girls, as mentioned above, and often forced into forced labor or being a soldier, with young men ages 14 to 18 often being forced as soldiers or forced labor. Many soldiers were forced to become suicide bombers and young men put in forced labor worked in mines, worked in the streets or assistant truck driving.\n\n*Crime victimization and abuse*\n\n[Physical abuse and corporal punishment is common for Afghan kids](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220614&type=printable). Except for baseline, boys were more likely than girls to experience physical punishment at home. Boys were also more likely than girls to experience peer violence victimization. Boys also scored higher than girls on depression, but often admittedly scored slightly higher on hope. Schools and teachers also inflicted corporal punishment and violence, particularly on boys. 100% of boy schools and only 20% of girl schools involved physical punishment from teachers. The same study found high rates of sexual abuse, including rape, of boys at schools, often by male teachers and older boys. When it comes to physical abuse, mothers often can be aggressors. In a [study](https://www.whatworks.co.za/documents/publications/424-ndungu-et-al-gibbs-2021-afghan-child-punishment-sem-15122021/file), 71.8% of married women admitted to physically abusing their children, and a little less than half said their partner also did so, which means many times, their partner, presumably a husband, did not do so. [In a study of physical abuse of children in Afghanistan](https://areu.org.af/wp-content/areu_publications/2016/01/804E-Love-Fear-and-Discipline-IP-print.pdf.pdf), men were more likely to believe boys got more physically disciplined, possibly due to probably experiencing it themselves or due to boys being perceived as potentially troublemakers. Women believed girls were beaten more, and women reported higher levels of violence directed towards girls because men might be unaware of violence mothers inflict on girls in the house.\n\n*Murder/homicide*\n\nIn Afghanistan, [87% of homicide victims are men](http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/data/GSH2013_Sex_data.xlsx). [In fact](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/9/10/it-is-time-we-remember-afghan-men-are-also-victims-of-this-war), Afghan men and boys were killed all the time and American media only focused on the women and children, portraying Afghan men as sexist oppressors, but these men are usually victims instead. Due to media portraying Afghan men as evil misogynistic terrorists, the American military killed many male Afghan civilians and assumed they were terrorists. The media used feminist language (even the right-wing media did this) to portray women there as damsels in distress in need to help but not due to care for the women there, but to influence Americans into supporting the war against Afghanistan. America's war created so many political and economic issues, it made Afghanistan even more dangerous and violent for women and even for men. In fact, the US military only helped solely women who claimed to be harmed by Taliban, so many women lied and said the Taliban hurt them to get US aid from the US military. Most American soldiers, just like their political leaders or generals, did not distinguish between Afghan male civilians and Taliban fighters, and thus killed many male civilians. They often were unlawfully imprisoned, tortured and killed by the US military despite being civilians. Often mistaken as security threats instead of civilians, these men were killed either by the US military or by Taliban. According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, between January 2004 and February 2020, the US conducted at least 13,072 drone attacks in Afghanistan, killing 4126 to 10,076 people. 300 to 909 of those killed are believed to have been civilians. It's impossible to know how many were really civilians, because the US did everything to obscure this number. As the New York Times [explained](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html) in 2012, for example, the Obama administration counted “all military-age males \\[killed\\] in a strike zone as combatants … unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent.” “Counterterrorism officials,” the Times article went on to say, “insist this approach is one of simple logic: people in an area of known terrorist activity, or found with a top Qaeda operative, are probably up to no good.” Thus, many Afghan men who were civilians were killed by being guilty by association. They lived in Afghanistan in areas the US attacked, being labeled as automatically terrorists by default.\n\n[In fact](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/07/1096382), the media emphasizes women and children in Afghanistan who are wounded or killed, when adult men are the most likely to have been killed. In Afghanistan, of all civilian casualties, 32% were women and 14% were children. This means 54% were men. Men were the most likely to be casualties, more so than women and more so than children. Not to mention some these children are presumably boys. The media emphasizes exclusively the women and children who are killed.\n\n*Taliban's treatment of boys*\n\n[Taliban have turned so many young boys into soldiers](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/09/20/our-opportunity-end-talibans-use-child-soldiers). Boys as young as 6 are indoctrinated, and by age 13, learned how to use firearms. By their teenage years they were required to fight. The US-backed Afghan government and pro-government forces also recruited and used young boys. Taliban also used these boys to carry out suicides and other violent attacks, recruiting them through deception, promises of money or other incentives, or even threats. Taliban and other armed forces used young boys many times to carry out suicide bombings because they thought they could manipulate them more easily and might be less suspicious than adults. The US-backed former Afghan government and other pro-government forces also recruited young boys as recruitment and using them to fight. [Taliban used many young boys even as young as age 7 as suicide bombers](https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/08/31/afghanistan-taliban-should-stop-using-children-suicide-bombers), telling them lies like they would survive the bombing themselves if they were an amulet with Quran verses on it. Boys as young as 11 were also recruited by Taliban to carry out activities like smuggling weapons across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, planting explosive devices, and armed combat. There were even 5 year olds used to plant bombs in south Afghanistan.\n\nAnother thing people must realize about Afghanistan is that women didn't lack rights in Afghanistan before Taliban took over. Look up pre-Taliban Afghanistan and women didn't need to wear veils and they were much more liberated and dressed in Western clothes and often had prestigious jobs. It was like America. Honestly if the CIA didn't give weapons to Islamic fundamentalist warriors in Afghanistan during the Afghan-Soviet War in the 80s, Taliban would've never taken over. That's how osama bin laden got his weapons. The CIA gave the mujahideen guerillas weapons which helped them fight off Soviets and they saved Afghanistan but these guerillas turned Afghanistan into another war zone. Then, the Taliban told Afghans that they would stop the war zones and offered an alternative, which many Afghans thought would liberate and save Afghanistan. They then recruited many people deceptively to increase the number of Taliban members, and this helped Taliban take over. A year after taking over, Taliban then began to become oppressive, which citizens didn't expect. If it wasn't for the CIA, the mujahideen wouldn't have taken over and thus Taliban wouldn't have been able to offer an alternative to citizens and take over. The CIA indirectly created Taliban. The CIA also are why Osama bin Laden managed to get weapons.\n\n**Iran**\n\nIran didn't make women dress a certain way or do anything particularly oppressive until 1979 when the Islamic Revolution happened. Before that, Iran was a secular monarchy and it wasn't different from the Western world. Women back then had more rights than women today in Iran. If it wasn't for the 1953 CIA assassination of their prime minister, King Shah wouldn't have had such a firm rule over Iran, which eventually led to Iranians having a fit about him and overthrowing him, creating modern Iran. The CIA's actions eventually led to modern Iran happening. But men in Iran have it just as bad as women in Iran. [This article](https://avoiceformen.com/featured/the-myth-of-patriarchal-oppression-in-iran/) should give a lot of information so read this article too. Boys in Iran are disproportionately raped or homeless, men are drafted, 81.9% of murder victims are men (see citation above for Afghan murder victims too which is where I got this from), and men are economically oppressed too. The media only shows what women go through. There's much more details about men's oppression in Iran. They aren't a patriarchy. They oppress everyone, just like America. For example, yes, men can divorce women for any reason while women can only divorce men for certain reasons, but women receive more benefits: \"Should a woman get divorced, in addition to what she gets out of her husband (called *Mehrieh*), her provider is considered to be her father and in case her father is dead, she will get from the government an equal share of her father’s occupational insurance as her salary for as long as she lives. This way, most divorced women do not have to work.\" Hell, mahr is something men have to pay to women in Iran if he divorces her and it's alimony but on steroids. Look up about it. Here's [two](https://avoiceformen.com/featured/indentured-servitude-for-men-in-iran-the-myth-of-patriarchal-oppressive-divorce-alimony/) [articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahr).\n\n**Syria and Iraq (ISIS)**\n\nThe media always talks about how ISIS oppress women, but they hurt men all the time. If you look at Syria, so many men are killed, including by ISIS.\n\n*Murder*\n\n[Since March 2011, when the Syrian civil war began all the way up to now, 228,647 Syrian civilians have been killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Syrian_civil_war#Civilian_deaths). 79.4% of them were men (181,540 men), 6.96% were women (15,925 women), and 13% were children (29,741 children). Many of these children probably are boys. This means women were the least likely to be killed and usually men are killed. In fact, of all the 5,043 civilians ISIS killed, 68.65% were men, 11.64% were women, and 19% were children. Of the 200,367 civilians killed by Syrian government forces, 82.24% were men, 11.45% were children, and 5.96% were women. This means it's typically men being killed there. [Within their first year following the 2014 declaration of Caliphate](https://www.ibtimes.co.in/isis-has-beheaded-stoned-shot-1362-civilians-including-9-children-report-630716), ISIS had already killed 1,362 civilians, including 9 children and 19 women. This means 97.94% were men.\n\n*Sexual assault*\n\n[Many times the media shows women being made as sexual slaves by ISIS. What they don't show is that many men face sexual abuse/rape in this region too](https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/latest/2017/12/5a27a4e04/male-rape-sexual-torture-widespread-syria-crisis-report.html). They often were held as prisoners and raped, gang raped, or sexually tortured with these men ranging from age 10 to age 80. They also might get jobs due to poverty while being sexually blackmailed or forced to do sexual favors in countries of asylum to be paid money. In asylum countries, boys might be molested by older youth and others. [This sexual abuse of men and boys is done by ISIS, other non-state armed groups, or even the Syrian government](https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/07/29/they-treated-us-monstrous-ways/sexual-violence-against-men-boys-and-transgender). LGBT men were particularly at risk, but it happened to men regardless of sexuality, including straight, cisgender men. A woman for The Guardian, a newspaper who are pro-feminist, [even said](https://www.theguardian.com/working-in-development/2017/nov/21/male-sexual-torture-in-the-syrian-war-it-is-everywhere) she initially thought this was rare but interview many refugees from that region and all of them, including all the women, told her that they knew many men who were raped or sexually tortured, and of all men detained in prisons, the female refugees estimated 30 to 40% of the detained men were sexually abused. Armed groups even conducted raids on homes and raped both men and women. When fleeing, boys were promised food or money by older boys but were instead molested. [Syrian men are just as often sexually assaulted or tortured as Syrian women](https://www.arabnews.com/node/1370701/middle-east). People think that in these countries, society hates women who get raped, but they don't. The social norms by a vocal minority who influence/form the government decide what is right and because these countries are often dictatorships/kingdoms, most people can't say what they truly think. People might pretend to view rape victims negatively, which is why being raped damages your reputation there, but people there actually don't feel this way towards rape victims. People hate rapists there, and Syrian families were horrified by the male and female rape victims in their family's stories of sexual assault victimization. Yeah, there are honor killings, but most murder victims there are men, and honor killings don't happen as much as the media says, and a considerable chunk of it happens in a couple specific countries.\n\n**Yemen**\n\n[Even in Yemen, men and boys are often sexually abused, raped or sexually tortured in detention centers](https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/countries/yemen/). [In 2020, about 62% of civilian casualties killed were men, but this article emphasizes women and children](https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/average-six-women-killed-every-week-yemen-result-ongoing-conflict). [Even in Yemen, men and boys are raped during conflict, and this is a problem that happens in conflicts worldwide, including in any other nation](https://web.archive.org/web/20190321220806/https://www.foxnews.com/world/male-rape-emerging-as-one-of-the-most-underreported-weapons-of-todays-wars). This problem even happened in Libya in the 2011 revolution. Even in yemen, boys as young as age 8 are raped by often militias aligned with the Saudi Arabia and UAE-led coalition. Psychologists treating former underage soldiers forced to fight for Houthis, an Islamist armed group in Yemen, found that 50 to 60% of them were sexually abused by their superiors.\n\n**Saudi Arabia**\n\nEven Saudi Arabia has their fair share of oppression of men. [When it comes to trafficking victims](https://www.state.gov/reports/2020-trafficking-in-persons-report/saudi-arabia/), they only give shelter to female domestic workers and nobody else. Only Riyadh had a place for male domestic workers. Men and women from other employment sectors were unprotected. People like to complain about how women are not allowed to walk out or go on an airplane without a male guardian (at least in the nighttime) but [young men weren't allowed in malls unless with a female relative in Saudi Arabia](http://www.alriyadh.com/1008285). [In fact, evidence shows that women in Saudi Arabia are more likely than men to be happy](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2020-12/spotlight.ksa_views_on_happiness.pdf). Saudi Arabia is more happy than most countries. People there might think people in the Western world treat women poorly, and that not allowing women to do certain things is protecting them. It's called benevolent sexism rather than misogyny (or hostile sexism). The way America views Saudi Arabia is how they view America, but the people there don't necessarily agree with the government laws. [In Saudi Arabia, virtually everyone who is executed is male](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-60722057), and there's many kinds of capital crimes there, and two-thirds of homicide victims are men (citation above). [In 2013](https://ncfm.org/2013/08/news/discrimination-news/discrimination-against-men-news/saudi-arabia-bans-domestic-abuse-because-it-hadnt-already/), Saudi Arabia banned domestic violence by men against women, but ONLY men committing domestic abuse against women. Women doing this to men wasn't even banned (although maybe they'll be charged with simply assault). So much for patriarchy. [In fact, in 2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20131109094735/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/02/saudi-protest-driving-ban-not-popular), most Saudi Arabian women opposed the right to drive and they believed it would lead to sexual harassment, men betraying them, and other problems. They believed it was horrible America would allow women to drive and thought it led to women being harmed or unsafe from predators, and believed this was an imitation of America. They instead believe America allowing women to drive is oppression. They believing being prohibited from driving was a privilege. In fact, this is similar to how long ago, many women often didn't want the right to vote because they believe suffrage was harmful to women by allowing them into the dangerous world of politics and considered the lack of right to vote a privilege or luckiness. [In fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_suffrage#Dates_by_country), Afghanistan didn't allow anyone to vote until 2004 where everyone including women could vote. Although women couldn't vote in Saudi Arabia until 2015, men couldn't until 2005, just ten years prior. Men are expected to pay full sum for the wedding even if his future wife makes more than him. Men are required to work as usual with no other option, but women can get the option to work and go to school (if given permission) or they can choose to be homemaker. While women can walk alone in the daytime, at night they are required to have a man with them, but this is an overprotective attitude about women, not misogyny (hate towards women). Society just doesn't care about men getting hurt.\n\n**Domestic violence**\n\n[There's surprisingly high rates of domestic abuse against men in the Arab countries, where way more men than women are victims of DV](https://www.arabbarometer.org/wp-content/uploads/Sexual-Harassement-Domestic-Violence-Arab-Citizens-Public-Opinion-2019.pdf). There are more male victims than female victims of domestic violence in Yemen (70% vs 19%) Libya (66% vs 17%) Tunisia (52% vs 32%) Palestine (51% vs 18%) Iraq (49% vs 17%) Jordan (48% vs 11%) Sudan (41% vs 25%) Algeria (34% vs 16%). There are more female victims of domestic violence than male victims in Morocco (35% vs 29%) Egypt (43% vs 26%) and Lebanon (56 vs 18%). Typically people there get help by contacting relatives instead of police for dealing with domestic abuse. They don't often contact police unless they're in Lebanon. Yes, women come forward in Arab countries. They contact the family, and the family intervenes. It's not like in the West where you call police.\n\n**Americans underestimate people's support for women's rights in these countries**\n\nPeople in these countries aren't as conservative as their governments might be. [Among men in Egypt](https://web.archive.org/web/20170503224119/http://imagesmena.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/04/IMAGESMENA-2017-FULL-Final.pdf), men can have conservative attitudes towards women but even men. These Egyptian men still had conservative attitudes about men, most believed men and women both should not have friends of opposite gender, and most of them (80%) believed that boys are responsibile for the behavior of their sisters, even if they're younger than their sister. This means they believe the boy should be held responsible for something the sister did. Many views in the data do show you that Egyptian men have conservative attitudes towards women, but people who have conservative attitudes about what women should do or their jobs don't feel this way due to hatred of women, but due to social norms/gender roles which they still believe about men, too. 94% believe men who fail to pay maintenence should be penalized. Women were far more likely to spank (79% of women and 41% of men) or hit their children (44% of women and 11% of men). Some of the men admitted to having slapped or pushed their wife before and some women experienced it but most did not experience in the past year. Relatively low percentages outright beat them, and even lower percentages did so in the past year. Hardly any threatened them with a weapon. 64% of Egyptian men and 60% of Egyptian women believed woman should marry her rapist (but it could be out of concern for her reputation), but 72% of men and 67% of women disagreed with the idea that rapists should not be prosecuted if he rapes a woman then marries her. Only just 16% of men believed a woman is obliged to have sex whenever the husband wants if he provides financially, compared to 33% of women thinking this. Nonetheless, 80% of men and 73% of women believe a woman should be able to refuse to have sex with her husband when she doesn't want to. **Remember this though, read Arab surveys with a grain of salt. As a guy who knows many Arab immigrants, many people in these countries might have a social desirability bias and will answer what they feel the government expects them to say or what the Western questionnaires expect them to say. They probably don't mean a lot of the things they say.**\n\n  \nAccording to [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/103441/saudi-arabia-majorities-support-womens-rights.aspx) in 2007 (and the results could be different these days), 67% of Saudi men believed men and women should have equal rights, 55% believed they should be able to drive, 75% believed women should be allowed to have any job they are qualified for outside home, 52% believed women should have leadership positions in the cabinet and national council, 83% said women should keep all earnings from jobs for themselves and that husbands should support them and the household in full, and 88% believe in divorce, the child's financial support should be full responsibility of the father even if the mom has custody. Iranians had similar attitudes too, and most Iranians supported women's right to drive, including most Iranian men.\n\n**Dress codes**\n\nPeople complain about how women are required to wear a veil, but this is only true in Saudi Arabia, Iran, and some of Afghanistan. It wasn't always true in these countries. Besides, in many countries they aren't required to wear anything and in any other country besides these 3 they aren't required to wear a veil but it is widespread. but only Saudi Arabia requires BURQAS. In Iran you still them wear normal clothes, just a mere hijab and they still show some of their hair. But men have a dress code too. [In Iran](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2013/11/07/IRN102671.E.pdf), men can't wear shorts or western hairstyles, and men who wear \"feminine\" clothes might get stripped or beaten. [Men have to cover knees, and cannot wear sleeveless shirts without stigmatization](https://www.bordersofadventure.com/iran-dress-code-what-to-wear/). [In Saudi Arabia](https://www.saudiarabiavisa.co.uk/dress-code-foreigners.html), men aren't required to wear thobes as tourists but must cover legs and shoulders. They must avoid skinny jeans, shorts or sleeveless shirts. [In fact](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/20/themalehijab), in Iran, up until maybe the 2000s, men were required to wear long-sleeved shirts before they could wear short-sleeved. [In Iraq](https://web.archive.org/web/20150529185836/https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/18/world/middleeast/a-haircut-in-iraq-can-be-the-death-of-the-barber.html), for example, barbers were killed by militias for giving \"un-Islamic\" haircuts or shaving beards. These Islamic militants tried to stop beardless men in Iraq. One Iraqi fled and said he was beaten up as onlookers cheered for lacking enough facial hair and wearing traditional clothes instead of a t-shirt and jeans or bright clothes or clothes with English writings. [Taliban](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2022-03-28/taliban-bars-government-employees-without-beards-from-work-sources) also set restrictions on men saying they will be fired from government unless they have beards and wear certain clothes. [Taliban even will severely punish any man without a beard and stop male drivers to check if he has a beard or not](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/rest-of-the-world-news/afghanistan-taliban-carries-out-vehicle-checks-to-see-mens-beards-womens-clothing-articleshow.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt's a myth that male privilege happens in Muslim countries. Men and women are both oppressed there and the media just focuses on when women are but ignores men's problems there. In fact, [the roots of sexism toward women in the Arab World go back to Ottoman empire problems, which is caused by western europe](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/the-real-roots-of-sexism-in-the-middle-east-its-not-islam-race-or-hate/256362/). It wasn't caused by Islam. These countries weren't even always like this and pre-Islamic Arabia was actually worse for women until Prophet Muhammad came. It wasn't until the past couple centuries (and couple decades in some countries) when it all changed. Dress codes in these countries used to be more diverse and vary until recent times.",

    "text": "Many studies show black men face more discrimination than black women. Here is the evidence: Intersectional feminists often argue that black women have it the worst, and they suffer worse than black men because they're black and a woman. Well guess what? There's lots of evidence that shows black men face more discrimination than black women.\n\nThis [article](https://theconversation.com/black-men-face-high-discrimination-and-depression-even-as-their-education-and-incomes-rise-141027) by *The Conversation* elaborates on what black men deal with. According to study 1, black boys from the wealthiest families were the most depressed. Study 2 found that for black men, the highest education credentials were associated with an increase, not decrease, in depressive symptoms. Study 3 found that in a nationally representative sample of American adults, black men with the highest income had the highest risk of depression, specifically major depressive disorder. Interpersonal or one-on-one discrimination was not found to be a factor. Study 4 found that 700 black teenagers were followed for two decades in Flint, Michigan. Perceived racial discrimination was measured in 1999 and 2002. Discrimination as teens was a predictor of depressive symptoms in people transitioned to young adulthood a decade later. Nonetheless, this was only true for black men, but not black women. In that same study in Flint, an increase in perceived neighborhood fear, defined as being scared of the crime and violence in the neighborhood, was linked with an increase in depressive symptoms for black men, but not black women. Study 6 found on IAT tests that white men had higher racist attitudes towards black people than white women, but the difference wasn't particularly extreme, but statistically significant. Nonetheless, white women also can be really racist towards black people, too.\n\nBlack men also get arrested, incarcerated and stopped or profiled far more than black women. Even white men experience being arrested and incarcerated far more than black women. And the reason why most prisoners are men isn't simply because men commit crime more. [A significant minority of criminals are women](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/xyl5wb/statistics_cited_women_are_more_likely_to_commit/), but female criminals are severely underreported, get arrested less when reported, are less likely to be incarcerated when convicted, are paroled earlier, and given more lenient sentences compared to men. Additionally, black men are far more likely than anyone else to be killed by police. [In fact](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-06/race-and-police-shootings-what-new-research-says), white and Asian men were much more likely than even black or Native American women to be killed by police. Almost all police homicide victims were men! [Black men were also much more likely than anyone, even black women, to be murdered in general](https://www.niussp.org/health-and-mortality/americas-high-homicide-rate/?print=print). [Black men are also more likely than black women to be victims of crime in general](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/bvvc.pdf). [Black men also were](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/05/02/for-black-americans-experiences-of-racial-discrimination-vary-by-education-level-gender/) more likely to be subject to racial slurs/jokes, be unfairly stopped by a police officer, have people act suspicious towards them, been assumed to be prejudiced, or to have feared for their personal safety. In fact, 59% of black men had been unfairly stopped by police, compared to just 31% of black women.\n\nAnother study called \"[Gender Matters Too](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2008-05171-002)\" found black men and women in 11th grade classrooms differed in their perception of peer and classroom discrimination. For boys, discrimination harmed their grades, attitudes and their regard for the importance of school. For girls, however, the effects generally had a positive impact. Another [study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspa0000288) found that the real root of racism towards blacks was perceived threat, not dislike, and that people were racist toward black people not due to negativity towards them but feeling threatened by them, especially black men. When isolating negativity from threat, they found no automatic black-negativity link. Negativity towards blacks was associated with viewing them as a threat. [In fact](https://polisci.osu.edu/sites/polisci.osu.edu/files/mcconnaughy_white.pdf), another study found that people viewed black men as particularly violent, and viewed white men as more violent than black women. They ascribed a low amount of violent personalities to black women and an especially low amount of it to white women. They viewed black men as more promiscuous than white men, white men as more promiscuous than black women, white women slightly more promiscuous than black women! They viewed black men as less intelligent than black women, and viewed black men as less ambitious than black women. Fast responders gave unpleasant responses to black men far more than to black women. All responders gave black men the most unpleasant responses compared to black women and white men and women, and black women slightly less unpleasant responses compared to both white men and white women! Another [study](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.848.1523&rep=rep1&type=pdf) found that even both male and female participants were equally likely as each other to be more willing to shoot a black unarmed suspect than a white female armed suspect or black female armed suspect. Men and women equally were likely (when not even looking at race) to prefer shooting unarmed male suspects over armed female suspects. An implicit racial bias [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/0146167219829182) found that black women were seen as more dangerous than white women by participants of all races, but they still viewed black men as more dangerous than black women. Even when looking at black children, they viewed black boys as more dangerous than black girls.\n\n**Black men had it worse during slavery**\n\nThis thread I made a year ago talks about how there were more male than female black people enslaved in the United States, and the black women were more likely to be free. In 19th century United States, [more men than women were slaves and more women than men were freed slaves](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1010277/black-and-slave-population-us-by-gender/). Although there was always a difference, the difference increased in the Civil War because of all the black male soldiers who died, and women weren't sent off to war as soldiers.\n\nThis only looks at the ones in the US. Believe it or not, the vast majority of enslaved black people were sent to places like South America or the Caribbeans, and a minuscule percentage were in the US. [When looking at all the enslaved black people from the 17th to 19th century](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1183869/ratio-male-female-slaves-by-route-1636-1867/), they found that in any region, men outnumbered women, with the gap being quite large in most regions. Many historians think all slave owners were white men, but evidence found that 40% were white women. They were often cruel and violent just like male slave owners. In fact, George Washington's wife owned way more enslaved people than him. White women were trained to enslave black people from a very young age, and they even were often given slaves as early as 9 months old! [According to](https://www.history.com/news/white-women-slaveowners-they-were-her-property) History.com:\n\n>White women were active and violent participants in the slave market. They bought, sold, managed and sought the return of enslaved people, in whom they had a vested economic interest. Owning a large number of enslaved people made a woman a better marriage prospect. Once married, white women fought in courts to preserve their legal ownership over enslaved people (as opposed to their husband’s ownership), and often won. “For them, slavery was their freedom,” Jones-Rogers observes in her book.\n\n**Black men were raped, too.**\n\nWe often hear about female slaves being raped, and how it was legal to rape black women. [What we don't hear about is how often black men were raped by slave owners](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/448992/pdf). [They often were](https://shareok.org/handle/11244.46/1279). They also were stripped naked and white people laughed at their genitals (i.e.: body shaming of men for their penis size even though they have no control or choice of their penis size). According to the [AAIHS](https://www.aaihs.org/sexual-violence-against-enslaved-men/),\n\n>Foster begins *Rethinking Rufus* by examining how enslaved men’s bodies were depicted in Western art and sculptures that were widespread in the visual culture of slavery. Foster argues that enslaved men’s bodies were “symbols of enslaved manhood and sites of violation” that were objectified through a number of cultural forms including art and literature (12). The objectification of enslaved men depicted in paintings often resembled everyday acts of terror including the public inspection of Black men’s genitals, whippings and lashings, and bodily exposure due to lack of adequate clothing. Visual depictions of enslaved men that emphasized their genitalia and sexual prowess gave way to the prevailing myths of Black hypersexuality and the Black male rapist, an archetype that ensured the extralegal protection of white women from Black men who purportedly lacked control over their sexual urges. Foster also argues that while visual depictions of enslaved men’s bodies often highlighted their athleticism, strength, and muscularity, this same imagery eroticized enslaved men’s bodies in ways that fueled the physical abuses and sexual exploitation of enslaved men. Foster notes that these stereotypes found in eighteenth-century visual art contributed to the eventual punishment and national disenfranchisement of Black men.\n\n**White women also raped or sexually preyed on black men, too.**\n\n[White women also had sexually abused black men, too](http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1674/sexual-relations-between-elite-white-women-and-enslaved-men-in-the-antebellum-south-a-socio-historical-analysis). White women were authority figures or in a position of power over these black men, and white women had sex with black men, often even raping them forcibly. White women also threatened to falsely accuse black men of rape if black men didn't have sex with them. Because abortion was unregulated, and any woman was able to get an abortion back then, many white women used this advantage to sexually abuse black men without people knowing she fornicated out of wedlock, and was able to abortion \"illegitimate\" children, hiding the evidence that she sexually abused black men. As a result of this and the fact that men could not speak about being raped because people believe men cannot be raped, historical records of white women raping black men are often overlooked, and it could've been more common than we think, perhaps as common as white men raping enslaved black women.\n\n**Almost all lynching victims were men whereas a significant minority of victims were white.**\n\n[Another interesting fact](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5803482/lynching-nj-1901/): virtually all lynching victims were men. Of all the 2,516 lynchings that happened from 1885 to 1901 in the US, 82.67% happened in the South and 13.75% happened in the North. 66.69% were black and 31.84% were white. 97.97% were men and 2.03% were women. Just 51 women lynched compared to 2,465 men. We always hear about how most victims were black, but no information about how virtually all were men. White men got lynched far more than black women. Black women rarely were lynched, and almost no white women got lynched.\n\n**Black people also face discrimination when it comes to rape.**\n\nIt is true that people are less responsive to black women who got raped than white female rape victims, but if people knew how common it was for men to be raped, and women rape men as just as much as men rape women (cited in a thread I cited above about women being more likely to commit crime than people think), then I'm sure they'd respond less to black male rape victims than white male or black female rape victims. In fact, they'd probably care for black women who are raped than white men who raped. Black men also are viewed as hypersexual, promiscuous, unable to control sexual urges, and always wanting sexual intercourse.\n\nAlso, false accusations happen a lot more than feminists admit, and I cite evidence for it in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/xzb7d8/statistics_show_that_false_accusations_are_quite/) of mine, and black men especially are affected. Black prisoners incarcerated for rape are especially likely to be innocent, especially when their accuser is a white woman. White women historically falsely accused black men of rape to get them lynched, and they still falsely accuse them, and while most rapists get away with it, black men who are accused by white women are more likely to be incarcerated even if they're innocent. It was considered rape historically for black men to have consensual sexual intercourse with white women, and there was a double standard for a while where people judged black men marrying white women more harshly than white men marrying black women because black men were viewed as predatory.\n\n**Education/life expectancy**\n\nBlack women also have a higher life expectancy than white men and especially black men, and are less likely to go to college than white men but [go more than black men](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/black-women-are-earning-more-college-degrees-but-that-alone-wont-close-race-gaps/).\n\n**Feminists don't care about black people, not even black women.**\n\nFeminists often don't pay attention much to black women's struggles. Even first wave feminists disregarded them and didn't want them to vote, let alone allow black men to vote, and that motivated them and was a reason why they wanted to vote, because they worried black men were technically allowed to vote despite Jim Crow laws and didn't want them to have the complete ability to vote before white women.\n\nNonetheless, many stereotypes feminists make about men are especially applied to black men due to society historically portraying them as hypermasculine, hypersexual and prone to violence or crime. Feminists' portrayal of men harms black men especially. They also ignore false rape accusations despite that white women still, to this day, falsely accuse black men of rape which is why so many black prisoners are falsely incarcerated for rape, and yet feminists expect every reported person for rape to be imprisoned. They also widely ignore how black women are associated more with the term black than with women, and aren't viewed as normal women.\n\nThis is why womanism (black feminism) was started.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDoes anyone notice how people hate black men more than black women? Yeah black women face pregnancy discrimination with prenatal care and dealing with more abortions and unwanted pregnancies, but black men usually don't ever get to see their kids, and often cannot afford to pay child support. Many black children are raised by single moms and barely knew their dad, if at all.\n\nThe reason black men face more discrimination than black women is due to people's racism towards black people being associated with seeing them as a threat, not dislike, and being a woman prevents black women from being seen as a threat as much as black men. Nonetheless, people might see black women as more dangerous than white women and be racist towards them due to a guilt by association mindset. In spite of that, people still are more racist towards black men because when racial attitudes are mostly about feeling threatened, people tend to view women in general as harmless, which is different from how they view men in general.",

    "text": "Women did make lots of contributions to society, and it is feminists, not men, who erased that from historical records. In fact, people have always thought women before their period were oppressed. A feminist from the 1940s named Mary Beard wrote a book called *Woman as a Force in History*. It critiques the myth that women were historically treated as subordinate to men and they were restricted from contributing to society or having basic human rights. Her book only includes just a portion of what women contributed to in society, and she says there's so much more. She has no idea how it got erased from history, but critiques the idea that women were historically oppressed compared to men.\n\n**Women did have an education in medieval times.**\n\nFeminists like to think that women were denied an education historically because people hated them and wanted them to suffer, but that's false. In fact, in medieval times, women were being educated all the time, and were as literate as men. G. G. Coulton, the life-long student of mediaeval history, gives a cautious answer: “Though very few women arrived at anything like the university stage in education, it seems probable that more of them could read and write than the men,” especially in the upper classes “at the period when romances of adventure were offered in profusion.” Interestingly, going to university was less common back then.\n\nThis [chapter](https://www.marxists.org/archive/beard/woman-force/ch11.htm) from her book elaborates on all the education women had back long ago in medieval Europe. It was very normal for them to have an education. Italian and German women especially had the most education of the Middle Ages. You can see that women had education and high literacy rates, and were more literate than men. They succeeded a lot in education. Maybe there were some societies that normalized education for boys, but that's because in those societies, education taught discipline, not facts, and people believed girls were more well-behaved than boys and thus didn't need it. Moreover, corporal punishment was used on boys much more, and boys were subjected to forced labor. This was meant for build character and discipline in children. Women weren't educated because it was believed they were less prone to bad behavior and didn't need to be educated. There was only a small overlap between education becoming useful for learning things, and women not being allowed to be educated. Later on, corporal punishment and forced labor declined in schools. It was actually seen as unmanly for boys to be willing to learn.\n\nEven in the later 19th century, girls performed better than boys in elementary schools and outnumbered them, and even in the early 1900s, when high school became more common, girls went to high school more often. Girls even had free education whereas boys in high school had to have their parents pay a fee. You can read more about this from the book *The Privileged Sex*.\n\n**Women did build society and contribute to the social and economic realm of society.**\n\nIn [Chapter 10](https://www.marxists.org/archive/beard/woman-force/ch10.htm), Beard wrote:\n\n>AFTER the dissolution of the Roman Empire, nearly all the economic activities connected with the production of food, clothing, and shelter were carried on in rural villages and their outlying fields everywhere in Western Europe. Whether the village was a free community or property belonging to the estate of a great feudal lord or lady, it was largely self-sufficing; its inhabitants supplied nearly all their needs for the maintenance of life. Furthermore, the industries of households and fields were not like the modern “heavy industries.” Women could handle nearly all of them alone or with some aid from men.  \n>  \n>Thus there was no sharp division of labor as a rule. Men and women worked together for the most part. If the major responsibilities for spinning, weaving, and cooking were women’s tasks, if wood-cutting and ditching were generally men’s tasks, men and women commonly worked side by side in the fields and to a considerable extent in all the processes of transforming raw materials into commodities for use. Whether the toilers on the land were bond or free, men and women labored under similar conditions and enjoyed similar liberties of choice such as they were. Though women gave birth to the children, both parents had the services of children to help them in their work. In the records of mediaeval rural life that are available in our age, no specially onerous burdens are found to have been laid on women as women by men as men. On the contrary the records show a sharing of the toilsome tasks on about the same terms.\n\nWomen were also, even in the Indian and Middle Eastern regions, just as involved in gilds as men. Beard writes:\n\n>While in some of the records the details are lacking, Smith’s *English* Gilds contains accounts of the structure, membership, functions, and proceedings of about eighty-five gilds. In at least seventy-two of them women were members on an equal basis with men. That is surely a large proportion. In some of the other gilds a slight qualification was placed on widows; they were accepted if their husbands had been gild men. Lest the idea of sheer generosity or friendship for the deceased be adjudged the reason for admitting widows to gilds, let it be remembered that, in innumerable cases, widows carried on the craft in which their husbands had been active, being directly familiar with it as a household industry at which they had themselves labored or in connection with which they had borne responsibilities for training and directing apprentices.\n\nWomen were not in a segregated gild, and mixed gilds were common. Some men didn't approve of women in some gilds, but it wasn't due to hatred of women, but because they believed women weren't strong enough for things like bread-kneading and bread-baking. Nonetheless, these men didn't get the monopoly they looked for:\n\n>But a French Parlement refused to prohibit the customary baking by women and declined to back up the men’s opposition to the women. A French parliamentary decree even accorded some gild women rights frequently denied to English widows; it ruled that a widow could retain her membership in a gild even if she took as her second husband a man who did not work in her craft.\n\nWomen also were involved in all kinds of parts of society:\n\n>Just as women took part and carried full loads of work in agriculture, domestic industries, and trading, just as they participated in the activities of craft, trade, and social gilds or corporations, so they shared and expressed themselves in all the forms of social life in town and country. In everything human their qualities and force were expressed – from religious and secular festivities, sports, games, and riots to the **discussion of religious and moral questions and the management of charitable undertakings**. In castles and cottages, in fields and in gild halls, on village greens and in churchyards, in towns and on city streets, in taverns and at market fairs they sought release from the rigors of earning a livelihood, from burdens of domesticity, or responsibilities belonging to the status of their class, whatever it was.\n\nWhen knights even had tournaments to display prowess, it was often done to impress female spectators. **Women's cheers brought outlets in arguments over public, private or religious matters, and in disputes about property, trade, marriage arrangements, family problems, tastes, habits and good or bad manners**. In fact, in medieval times, women were very fierce in many cases, and they would steal husbands' money and run with monks, get in violent fights with women in arguments, smash knights with swords, drinking and singing in taverns, etc. One woman even bloodied a priest's nose after he tried to rape her. When the priest ordered to her to become a pilgrim to Rome, Thomas of Cantimpre laughed and advised to the woman that if a priest sexually assaults or inappropriately pursues her:\n\n>then thou smite him sore with thy clenched fist, even to the striking out, if possible, of his eye; and in this matter thou shalt spare no order of men, for it is as lawful for thee to strike in defense of thy chastity as to fight for thy life.\n\nIn medieval times, women were seen as sinful or wicked, resorting to magic, or the originators of sin, and in need to obey priests or obedient to their husbands, but men were seen as brutal or vulgar, and he had to love his wife, help her support the family and never harm her, and charivaris were done against him or even family intervention if he abused his wife. This was all a reaction to the aggression women engaged in then that people thought women would never do and that only men would do (and feminists reinforce this gender role by portraying all violent women as victims):\n\n>Also, repeated again and again and again in mediaeval documents was the idea that women had been better, if not ideal, “in the good old days,” but were now given to luxury, assertiveness, display, love of worldly goods and pleasures. Hence it would appear that the newest clichés are not so new after all.\n\nMen fought at wars more than women and committed crime more, but women who had power waged wars. Women assembled soldiers. Women fought side by side with men. Women were guilty of many cruelties, and women aided and approved the worst. Women conformed to no type, and they weren't \"tame\" in a \"man's world\". \n\n**Women had a lot of power in marriage and family that men had.**\n\nAccording to the same chapter, Beard wrote:\n\n>Beyond all question the weight of documentary evidence is against any simple conclusion that men handed women around like chattels; that boys were free to make their own choices of mates, while girls were helpless creatures at the disposition of men. After the rise of the centralized state, no one, male or female, was actually “free,” save perhaps the king or queen as highest lord, and even members of royal families had to be on guard against actions likely to stir up revolt among underlings. As a matter of fact, fathers and mothers of the middle and lower classes, as well as lords and ladies, took part in arranging the marriages of both boys and girls under the almost universal rule of “convenience.” The boy apparently had no more choice than the girl. There are records indicating that boys and girls sometimes made vigorous protests without avail; other records show that their protests were effective. But the general rule of marriage for convenience long prevailed.  \n>  \n>Whether fathers or mothers , men or women, usually dominated in the making of matches is a matter buried in the silence of unrecorded history, but there is abundant proof that women were active in the business and were no less circumspect or ruthless than men at the business. Women looked about for marriageable boys and girls to be convenient mates for girls and boys in their own families. Maidens were inclined to be shrewd and insistent – that is, “practical” – in marrying men with property, when they had any chance of selection, as they often did. Mothers were zealous in procuring for their daughters men who had property and in making sure that the property was good, and carefully guarded by proper legal titles. In other words, the marriage of convenience was no one-sided affair in which fathers and sons “had their own way” with the women concerned in it.\n\nAnd women still owned property. It's a myth they couldn't historically. They always were allowed to even back in antiquity. \n\n**Women were involved in warfare and building antiquity.**\n\n[According to chapter 12](https://www.marxists.org/archive/beard/woman-force/ch12.htm), German writer Sir Galahad described the ways of aggressive women long ago. Proof of armed women was found in European ancient ruins, proving that Amazons, the Greek female warriors, were real. Some people think early human years were peaceful, but fights broke out and disrupted it, and women were active in these conflicts in every way men were:\n\n>Where they had power as rulers or in ruling families they often instigated and proclaimed wars and even marshaled their troops as they went into battle. They incited men to ferocity at the fighting fronts. They accompanied men on marauding expeditions. They fought in the ranks. They took up arms to defend their homes. They nursed men on battle fronts or kept households going while men were at battle, and they looked after the wounded on their return to civilian life.  \n>  \n>There was not a type of war in which women did not participate. They were among the primitive hordes which went on looting expeditions against their neighbors or stood fast on their own ground in defense of their lives, herds, and fields. Old Roman records testify to the savagery of women in the Cimbrian tribes that swept down from the north into Rome. Among the Cimbrians, priestesses took charge of war captives. Standing on ladders which they carried with them to battle, they cut off the heads of prisoners, caught the blood in pots, and gave it to their men to drink, in the belief that it would double their strength.\n\nAncient women also initiated or inspired military efforts to subjugate others. Alexander the Great's militant Epirote mother, \"a priestess to whom his father, Philip, had been attracted when he saw her as a maiden prancing to or from a temple with a snake, a god symbol, held high in her arms, and attended by a procession of other maidens\", drove Alexander to become the master of the world. In most of Europe in antiquity and even during Arabia when Islam spread and people declared war against the Muslims, women fought at war. Even Muhammad had his female warriors who teamed up with him.\n\n**Women did influence politics, economics and social change historically.**\n\nFeminists argue women were forbidden from politics. Not exactly. While people were serving in the government were men in many societies, it's because they believed those who fought for our country were the ones allowed to form the government, but not all societies only sent women to war. [In fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_suffrage#Dates_by_country), in almost all countries, originally, neither men nor women could vote, and they usually granted suffrage to both concurrently. In some countries, they originally granted it men, then later women. In the US and UK, men originally could only vote if they owned property, and only 3% of British men and 6% of American men did (women were never property). In 1828 during the presidential election, the vast majority of states gave all men the right to vote, but it wasn't in all states until universal white male suffrage was given to men in North Carolina in 1856. Later on, women were given the right to vote more and more. It was simply because men served in the military in the US back then, not because women were considered inferior.\n\nNonetheless, women DID influence politics historically. Not voting didn't stop this, [and many women were originally against the right to vote](https://www.societyforhistoryeducation.org/pdfs/M15_Miller.pdf) because they worried it'd take away their soft power in influencing politics. In fact, many men supported their right to vote for equality, and while people who supported women's suffrage thought it was unfair they couldn't vote, people who opposed it worried that women had more power influencing politics than men because the government responded to women's needs more while men just cast in a vote that only wins if it's the majority opinion. Susan B. Anthony said women's suffrage laws \"probably never would have passed if it had been up to women to vote on them,\" and that men were actually more progressive about women’s suffrage than women were (1902). This [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/15ac3xy/women_did_influence_politics_before_suffrage_and/) of mine elaborates on how women influenced politics easily before voting.\n\nContrary to what feminists think, laws weren't created based strictly on the opinions of men. Only 1% of men worked for the government, and they usually made laws based on what they thought was best for the land or its people, but not for men. Totalitarian leaders might be all about themselves, but certainly not men either. Women's opinions mattered a lot to men. [In fact](https://presidentlincoln.illinois.gov/Blog/Posts/141/Abraham-Lincoln/2021/8/Lincolns-avoided-duel/blog-post/), [Abraham Lincoln](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/abraham-lincolns-duel) even used female pen names pretending to be a woman to attack political rivals, including James Shields.\n\nAlongside speaking against recent policy decisions made by Shields, Lincoln implied that his opponent was weird and unpopular with women.\n\n>*\"His very features, in the ecstatic agony of his soul, spoke audibly and distinctly – 'Dear girls, it is distressing, but I cannot marry you all. Too well I know how much you suffer; but do, do remember, it is not my fault that I am so handsome and so interesting.’”* \\-- Rebecca (Abraham Lincoln)\n\nLincoln's wife also wrote several letters against Shield under a female penname. Lincoln apparently consulted with her about his letters to make them sound like a woman wrote them. What does this mean? Women were seen as pure and moral compared to men, so their voices mattered a lot in politics, and because they couldn't vote, they were seen as fair and reasonable. **This is why women often opposed the right to vote, because they worried it would prevent them from being influential in politics.** If the 1800s were so patriarchal, why would he have used a female penname to pretend that a man was unpopular with women to destroy that man's career?\n\n[Moreover](https://daily.jstor.org/women-against-womens-suffrage/), Catharine Beecher, an advocate for women’s education and economic advancement, argued that women were most effective when they united to press their fathers, brothers, and husbands for reforms in terms that rose above intense partisan politics. Using anecdotal evidence, she pointed to her sister, Harriet Beecher Stowe, whose [*Uncle Tom’s Cabin*](https://daily.jstor.org/frederick-douglass-feud-over-uncle-toms-cabin/) had contributed to anti-slavery sentiment in the country, selling quickly before the Civil War and humanizing enslaved black people. It changed American's views of enslavement at the time, especially in the North. Another example was the women’s clubs that fought for pure food laws, [compulsory schooling](https://daily.jstor.org/why-would-parents-oppose-compulsory-education/), and other reforms that were easily framed in terms of maternal care.\n\n[Women influenced politics in many other ways, too](https://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/5-ways-women-influenced-politics-they-got-vote). In the 1800s, men and women flirted at political rallies and met their potential spouse. Politically-charged women charmed men into supporting certain political views, especially first-time male voters. In his new book *The Virgin Vote*, Smithsonian political history curator Jon Grinspan explains that women even \"turned down marriage proposals specifically because of a young man's political affiliations.\" These actions pressured husbands and suitors to vote in favor of a woman's views.\n\nCarry Nation, a female leader in the Temperance movement, used to use hatchets to smash saloons. Churches and theaters paid her to against alcohol. In the Victorian era, if a man smashed alcohols, he'd be stabbed, but men were chivalrous towards women and refused to harm her. Many people laughed at her, but respected her integrity for her beliefs anyway. Carry's radical approach helped launch the Temperance movement into mainstream American politics.\n\nEven in medieval times, women teamed up with Prophet Muhammad to fight off aggressors against Muslims and helped spread the message of Islam. Women in medieval Europe brought discussions and disputes about moral, societal, or religious issues.\n\nWhen wars happened over the centuries, wars of conquest, defense, crusades, or self-defense did not exclude women. As long as the Eastern Empire lasted, women were involved in situations that led to war. As the empire declined and feudal wars happened for imperialism, women in aristocracies and royal families inspired and initiated wars, and sometimes used their own weapons. They built the state of Western worlds which turned local conflicts into global wars, assisted by women. For centuries in the West and East, imperial power only was ostensibly (but not exactly so) bestowed to men who were head of a family. In reality, official or not, his power was shared by women. Imperial power was often exercised by one or more women. Even in Ancient Rome, the state had lots of power among its women. Beard cited:\n\n>Among such studies of ancient Rome are the 1,124 pages of the old work by J. R. de Serviez, *Roman Empresses ... Wives of the Twelve Caesars,* first published in the eighteenth century – an age of despotism in Europe; and G. Ferrero’s *Women of the Caesars,* published in 1911 when the power of European family clans was rapidly dissolving.\n\nOther wars/conflicts, like the Renaissance, the restoration of the Bourbons, War of the Spanish Succession, War of the Austrian Succession. As medieval Europe was developing, in rural families, men and women worked together almost consistently, and the woman kept the family and its land and house economy going while husbands went to war in England. In royal and aristocratic families in England, women used force in the state of affairs and in the management of the economy helping the monarchy. It wasn't until the the 18th century in England during revolutions destroying the royal/aristocratic families founded on wealth did women and their families in these groups lose power and the parliament and government became solely men. As time went by men, men were the ones serving in military, and they decided men thus would be the ones allowed in the government, but women had soft power in influencing politics as mentioned earlier, which is why people worried giving them the right to vote would get rid of that subtle power. This change happened especially in the French Revolution. In the 1800s, more and more women suffragists were appearing, but men also struggled with the right to vote beside the low minority who had property and thus qualified. In the most progressive societies, women received the right to vote before men's universal suffrage appeared in other societies. Before this point, there were women were highly involved in royal/aristocratic power over influencing politics and society. \n\n[Up until a couple centuries ago](https://www.cracked.com/article_20186_6-ridiculous-myths-about-middle-ages-everyone-believes.html), Europe was agricultural. In medieval Europe, if a father was owning a shop or tavern, his daughters were the ones helping. If her dad became unable to, she sometimes took over the business herself if he was now unable to, which didn't really happen until later in modern times. Women also generally ran taverns in medieval Europe, and [women in England ran the entire beer industry back then](https://books.google.com/books?id=c6MQJ-pdbwAC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false). Women who didn't run taverns or grow crops often joined convents, and when education was rare at the time, it gave these women access to education. Thus, nuns could read or write in an era where the most powerful kings couldn't. [If women could eventually rule of a house of nuns, they could reach position of power very similar to a male lord, or even slightly higher, seeing as how they technically reported directly to the King of Kings and whatnot](https://web.archive.org/web/20100215224014/http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/medieval/women2/medievalwomen.html). Sometimes, in monasteries, the abbess had seniority over monks. Outside monastic walls, women could wield political power, especially as queens and regents who exercised royal authority when their husband or underage son was unavailable. A number of powerful queens can be noted in English history, of whom one of the most remarkable was Queen Isabella (1295-1358), who (in collaboration with her lover, Sir Robert Mortimer) ended the rule of her husband, Edward II (1284-1327).\n\n[Even in the Middle East](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1525/ae.1974.1.3.02a00100), women DO influence politics and society. They do it from private positions, and exercise influence over men, by being mediators in natal or affinal groups in marriage alliances, wielders of authority in the domestic sphere, educating their children, or controlling products or property. Women form kinship groups, act as \"data brokers\", mediating social relations in family and society. Women also notify men in their household about what happens in other homes and in extended family. Women also, despite being segregated by sex at times, join with other women in forming solidarity groups and spreading social influence. It helps cause political influence and raises her social status. Women also can influence men's behavior by spreading rumors or gossip, writing mock songs, and spreading social influence to boost or ruin his reputation, especially in social and political issues. Women there might not be in the government, but men rarely make it in the government, and women have so much widely ignored soft power in influencing society and politics, but feminists don't realize in some countries where dictatorships occur, they won't always get what they want, but some of the women's opinions there ARE socially conservative. Women there do influence how people think there and eventually these countries will lose their social norms if people figure their way around their countries' domineering government.\n\nWe have laws pandering to women, including battered women's shelters, campaigns and organizations for women's health, laws against violence against women, etc, but while these politicians are men, they don't make these laws for men. People have always responded to women's soft power historically and politicians' success depended on his support from women more than from men. Men weren't always able to vote historically, but when men served in the military more, they were given the right to vote, but women were still granted soft power that made more changes than mere marks on ballots that only won if a majority. That's why suffragists were originally a minority, but still managed to spread enough influence to become a majority.\n\n**Women were not excluded from history from men, but by feminists.**\n\nIn Chapter 12, Mary Beard wrote:\n\n>Certainly the original sources, which scholars use for the study of men in long and universal history, often mention and even recount stories or give elaborate data of many kinds about women. For example, Herodotus, whom historians of the modern age have called “the father of history,” deliberately included women in his history. Tacitus, the Roman, also observed and commented on the women of his time. Indeed ancient writers in various societies often thought it necessary to consider women and among their works are to be found statements respecting women’s force of character, learning, physical energy, military and political power, and creative intelligence – statements made by the contemporaries of such women.\n\nSo obviously, writers and historians didn't exclude women and even wanted them included. Mary Beard wrote in her book that the idea that women were men's subordinates and were forbidden from contributing to society is one of the biggest myths told in history. Feminists have erased the fact that 40% of slave owners in the US were white women and that women had soft power or even before the 1700s, had royal and aristocratic power, and promoted myths that women were property, were expected to be asexual beings even in marriage, were allowed to be beaten/raped by their husband, or were violently hated. Feminists probably originally removed women's contributions to society from history. Then decades later, feminists wanted to educate society about women's contributions to society they claimed were erased by men because they are clueless about what the first wave feminists did.",

    "text": "I wonder if men of shorter stature are invisible to feminists, or make just as good cannon fodder. You know what they say, \"Men don't have to worry about being safe when walking at night\".\n\nLike this comment:\n\n>The really sad thing is that women even have to consider whether a man is a threat. But this is a reality in the life of a woman. You probably never think twice about walking in a deserted parking garage, or the vehicle parked next to yours with a person sitting in the passenger seat, or getting in an elevator and a man steps in just before the doors close. I guarantee every woman takes her safety into account in these situations.\n\nOh gee, I forgot, that male privilege gives me 100% damage reduction from bullets, punches/kicks, etc.\n\nAnd also: \"It's your duty to intervene, to call out sexism, etc. etc.\" like the infamous Gillette ad four years ago: \"To say the right thing. To act the right way. Some already are. In ways big and small. But some is not enough.\"\n\n\"Men have to hold other men accountable.\" said Terry Crews, the 6'2\"/237# former NFL player.\n\nOkay, now I am 5'7\"/150#, with no athletic inclinations whatsoever. I don't watch any sports at all because it bores me to tears (except classic auto racing, from ca. 1950-2000), I don't know anything about (American) football and don't care to learn because it won't be useful to my life, and with my shorter stature and athletic disinterest combined, thus can't exactly count on physical strength. Do they really think that all men are 6' or taller?\n\nAnd now it's my duty to call out a 6'5\"/250# football player in a cocaine-induced rage because he told one sexist joke.\n\nWhat do they think is going to happen? That this guy will just say \"Oh, hey, you're right, I shouldn't have said that, I will educate myself and try to do better.\" So, tell me you've never met another person before without saying you've never met another person before. This \"~~protect your daughter~~/educate your son\" virtue-signaling. Because I can tell for sure that Bart is totally open to being educated. It's not like he's already an underachiever at school, a prankster and disrespects authority (Homer, Principal Skinner, etc.), calling Homer generally by his first name and not \"Dad\" and [diss raps about him on stage, calling him a fat load.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTsB95Snluc) He'd totally listen, right? And \"saying all men are rapists/it's in their nature is misandrist/insulting to men/shows you have a really low opinion of men\". Opinion is like an asshole, everyone is entitled to one, doesn't mean it's always right. And when did I say that it's in the nature, point out the exact words. Also, France (Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau) did not try to \"educate the Germans\" at the Paris Peace Conference, but really wanted to really punish Germany hard, harsh reparations, territory annexations, the whole nine yards, because they bore the brunt of the WWI horrors. As he said: \"America is far away, separated by ocean, and even Napoleon couldn't touch England. You two are both sheltered, we are not.\" I guess maybe Woodrow Wilson and David Lloyd George should have called him out for \"having a low opinion of the Germans\" or that he was being \"insulting to the Germans!\"\n\nAnyway, back to the main point, more likely, this 6'5\"/250# football player will be throwing me down on the floor and then beating the shit out of me. Like I said, I'm just 5'7\"/150#, so if he wanted to harm me, he is going to succeed at it. So I have to \"be an ally\" and risk life-threatening injuries, and later also pay the medical costs (at best), have to spend my entire life in wheelchair (worse case) or die (worst case), but hey, at least now I have earned some \"ally points\". What a good deal, where and what for can I redeem them? Like Bill Allen said: \"Better to be a live coward than a dead hero. Sure people will still sing about dead heroes from time to time, but aside from that they get little attention. Unless they manage to get a holiday named after them. Even then, it's not like they get to enjoy the day off.\"\n\nSo, actually here's another debate topic. **For men of shorter stature, safety is not a given.** And many of those feminists tend to also be politically more on the progressive-liberal (not necessarily left/leftist) and collectivist/authoritarian side. The side that's usually not so gun-friendly. But if I am two inches below the average American male height, how am I supposed to defend myself? Not that have to actually want to shoot someone, oftentimes the mere sight of a gun will make an attacker think he's not that tough after all and scamper. I mean, it's such a tragedy that the feminists have to walk with car keys between their fingers while walking at night. While if I did that, since I can't count on physical strength, I would only achieve 1) making the assailant angrier and thus 2) reducing my chances of survival, not to mention fucking up my fingers. Or if I carried pepper spray or mace, it would end up right in my face if used downwind. Knife? You know what they say, \"The winner of a knife fight dies in hospital, the loser in the street.\"\n\n**So, for a shorter man, dating may be harder, but there are more important, more pressing issues, like self-defense/self-preservation.**\n\nPostlogue: But hey, if it mainly targets women, then it's all \"society bad, men bad, have to change\". But when the vast majority of the crime victims are men, \\**crickets chirping*\\* Like New York in the 1970s, in the Lindsey and Beame era, when the city was near bankruptcy (Remember the infamous NY Daily News \"Ford to City: Drop Dead\" headline?), and had to \"defund the police\" to stabilize the budget. And the best NYPD could do under those circumstances was to pass out pamphlets at JFK/Newark/LaGuardia saying \"[Until things change, stay away from New York City if you possibly can.](https://archive.org/details/FearCity/)\" Very likely, the vast majority of the crime victims then were men. So will the feminists also agree that all this was victim blaming: \"Stay off the streets after 6 PM, do not walk, avoid public transportation, remain in Manhattan, protect your property, safeguard your handbag, conceal  property in automobiles, do not leave valuables in your hotel room\"?",

    "text": "The History of Somatic Symptom Disorder, AKA \"Hysteria,\" and how it has shaped the medical field, ChatGPT, WebMD, and its effect on women today. This is separated by sections with titles in all caps\n\nHISTORY\n\nFrom the American Psychiatric Foundation: \" Somatic symptom disorder is **diagnosed when a person has a significant focus on physical symptoms, such as pain, weakness or shortness of breath, to a level that results in major distress and/or problems functioning**. The individual has excessive thoughts, feelings and behaviors relating to the physical symptoms.\"\n\nWhich is further defined as: \" **The somatoform disorders are a group of psychiatric disorders that cause unexplained physical symptoms. They include somatization disorder (involving multisystem physical symptoms), undifferentiated somatoform disorder (fewer symptoms than somatization disorder), conversion disorder (voluntary motor or sensory function symptoms), pain disorder (pain with strong psychological involvement), hypochondriasis (fear of having a life-threatening illness or condition), body dysmorphic disorder (preoccupation with a real or imagined physical defect), and somatoform disorder not otherwise specified (used when criteria are not clearly met for one of the other somatoform disorders).** \"\n\nFrom [ScienceDirect.com](https://ScienceDirect.com) article by  R.E. Kendell, in [International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/referencework/9780080430768/international-encyclopedia-of-the-social-and-behavioral-sciences), 2001 \n\nHysteria no longer appears in the DSM-5 Nomenclature but....  \"The term hysteria comes from the Greek word *hystera* for womb, reflecting the belief of ancient Egyptian physicians that the phenomena of the disease were due to ‘wandering of the womb.’ [Hippocrates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/hippocrates) and Galen both accepted this assumption and until the late nineteenth century hysteria remained a disease of women and of the body (generally the nervous system).   The idea that it was a purely [psychological disorder](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/psychological-disorder) dates from Breuer and Freud's [*Studies on Hysteria*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/studies-on-hysteria) in 1896, which led to the psychoanalytic concept of hysteria—the dominant explanatory theory for the next 60 years. The demise of hysteria was due primarily to the fact that the term came to be used in a variety of ways that were only tenuously related: (a) neurological conversion symptoms; (b) psychophysiological reactions—a wider concept of conversion including pain and visceral symptoms; (c) dissociative reactions—fugues and amnesic episodes assumed, after Janet, to be based on dissociation of consciousness; (d) outbreaks of mass, or epidemic, hysteria; (e) Briquet's syndrome—multiple, unexplained, somatic symptoms and persistent invalid behavior; (f) anxiety hysteria—an obsolete psychoanalytic term for phobic anxiety; and (g) a personality type assumed to be particularly susceptible to develop hysterical symptoms. Contemporary understanding of hysterical behavior has been influenced strongly by the sociological concepts of the ‘sick role’ and ‘illness behavior’ and by learning theory, and attempts to reduce both the attractions of the sick role and influences discouraging healthy behavior now have a central role in management. This conceptual model explains the distribution of hysterical behaviors in populations, including the predominance in young women, and many other clinical observations, but it fails to account either for neurological conversion symptoms or for fugues and other dissociative phenomena.\"\n\nBasically what this says is that Hysteria was created in 1900BC and was labeled as the \"wandering womb\" claiming that the uterus would move locations and the SOLUTION to this was... Marriage and sex... Well... Sex really. Coitus.\n\nFrom  K. Pajer, in [Encyclopedia of Stress (Second Edition)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/referencework/9780123739476/encyclopedia-of-stress), 2007:\n\n\"Subsequent centuries brought changes in the definition and hypothesized etiology of hysteria. The definition became quite broad, referring to nearly any symptom of disease that was found more often in women than in men. Etiological explanations continued to focus on uterine pathology but also included causes such as satanic possession.\"\n\nThis means that any sort of disorder or symptom that was found in women but not in men was labeled as \"Hysteria\"\n\nAlso from K. Pajer:\n\n \"The nineteenth century brought a dramatic increase in the incidence of hysteria, although it is not clear why this happened. Treatments continued to focus on the uterus and newly discovered ovaries. The cauterization of the cervix, leeches applied to the cervix and vagina, and the removal of the ovaries were all common treatments that were only moderately successful. In the late nineteenth century, however, [hypnosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/hypnosis) was discovered to be useful for curing some symptoms of hysteria, such as the paralysis described earlier in S.M. Janet, Freud, and others believed that the mechanism of this cure was that hypnosis allowed the [therapist](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/therapists), and then later the patient, to gain access to repressed feelings. In exploring these hidden feelings, buried conflicts could be resolved and the symptoms would disappear. The use of hypnosis diminished as Freud developed the technique of free association with interpretation by the analyst. This technique became the hallmark of psychoanalysis and was eventually used for many psychiatric disorders. \"\n\nSYNTHESIS\n\nFrom a Sociological perspective, one could argue that the cultural idea of  can be dated back to 1900BC. \n\nHere's what I mean. You all know what I mean. The concept of no one listening to you. It's not instinctual for men to be like that. It's cultural and sociological and perpetuates an idea that's based in 1900BC. Men have not listened to women about their health issues since 1900BC, to the point where they created a disorder that can be used as an excuse to not listen.\n\nThe concept of \"Hysteria\" has effected so many women today. The last mental asylum wasn't shut down until 1996 with Bill Clinton. Before these mental asylums were shut down, men could drop their wives or any female relative off, and they would not be allowed to leave until that same person came to remove them. If that person died, you would not be returning to normal society. Many women were born, raised, and died in these mental health asylums until 1996.\n\nSo that being said: let's chat. Here's the topic:\n\nThe concept of \"Hysteria\" has created a long-standing, sociological, cultural, and instinctual mindset towards the attitude of women, what we talk about, do, who we are, how the world sees us, and most importantly: how doctors see us.\n\nThis concept is so deeply bred into our culture that the language perpetuated by it is often seen in so much of our media, and is so deeply ingrained in us. \n\nGoing back to what Freud said, claiming it to be \"(a) neurological conversion symptoms; (b) psychophysiological reactions—a wider concept of conversion including pain and visceral symptoms; (c) dissociative reactions—fugues and amnesic episodes assumed,\"\n\nWHICH: the definition of visceral means very real, and relating to soft internal organ systems like the heart, lungs, and reproductive system. Fugues is loss of awareness usually \"associated with forms of hysteria or epilepsy.\" Or, for better words, when you zone out and aren't aware of things momentarily and briefly forget what's going on.\n\nSo BASICALLY that moment where you can't think about anything because your period is absolutely so painful.\n\nThis is basically saying \"Oh yeah is she is a woman, is having some brain fog, and she's feeling pain- it's not real\" which is an idea created by Ancient Egyptians, then perpetuated by Sigmund Freud, the \"Father of psychoanalysis\" which was then put into the DSM-5 because of him and USED TO ABUSE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WOMEN. \n\nthis is like when you're watching a movie, and there's not a single scene where two women are together and they're NOT talking about a man. \n\nOr when you go to the doctor to get an IUD inserted, and they don't provide any cervical dilaters, painkillers, or anything of the sort, and just go right in like we're back in 1900BC.\n\nOr when you go to the doctor because you're crying in pain, and they won't give you painkillers even though you're 3 years clean from opioid addiction, and your pain levels are reading as an intolerable level.\n\nSo, that moment when you tell your boyfriend that you're upset about something, and he doesn't seem to care. The father who claims his daughter's period to be \"not that bad.\" The old-fashioned mother who won't allow you to bring your bathing suit to the pool party because she knows your on your period and doesn't want you to use a tampon. The husbands who ignore their wives pregnancy pain and tells them to \"Just deal with it, it'll be out in a few months anyway\" and then the wives end up dead because it was really a medical emergency.\n\nSO Sigmund Freud is the reason to blame for why you never get help for your period pains.\n\nAnything that is sexist can probably be related to this social idea. In a world where men don't listen to women, the world was created for them and not for us. \n\nI recommend reading \"Invisible Women\" by  Caroline Criado-Perez. In her book she examines many of the things in America that you wouldn't think would be attributed to sexism. Like how the cities are plowed first instead of the small towns because more men drive to work.\n\nCHATGPT AND WEBMB\n\nIf you go to WebMd and search for conditions, with anything that is both related to the brain (neurological) and pain (neurological/inflammatory/receptors that respond to stimuli/yes fish still feel pain) and your gender is set to female, one of the conditions on that list, usually close to the top, is somatic symptom disorder, which is hysteria.\n\nIf you set the gender to male, it will show up if you include general pain like \"muscle pain\" but it is usually farther down the list. If you provide an array of mixed symptoms, it will usually not show up.\n\nWhy is this an issue? Because when you go to the doctor, chances are when they leave and come back, they're going to google or look up all of your symptoms.\n\nHere's what I got from ChatGPT\n\n \n\nHere's a list of ten possible conditions that could cause pelvic pain, brain fog, and fatigue in a 22-year-old woman:\n\n1. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\n2. Endometriosis\n3. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)\n4. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n5. Fibromyalgia\n6. Hypothyroidism\n7. Depression or anxiety disorders\n8. Iron deficiency anemia\n9. Interstitial cystitis\n10. Urinary tract infection (UTI)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this instance, it labels Depression and Anxiety as \"Mental health conditions like depression and anxiety can cause physical symptoms such as pelvic pain, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating.\"\n\nWhich, is partially true, but to me it seems like the pain, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating would be the thing CAUSING the anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression is a real thing, but most oftentimes, they are comorbid with something else. (Please correct me if I am wrong.)\n\nI did it again, with better more specific results.\n\n\"based on the symptoms you described, here's a list of ten possible conditions that could explain a woman's lower abdominal pain, difficulty concentrating, warm feeling over the uterus, intense cramps, delayed period, and a false pregnancy test result:\n\n1. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): PID is an infection of the reproductive organs that can cause lower abdominal pain, fever, abnormal vaginal discharge, and delayed periods.\n2. Endometriosis: Endometriosis is a condition where the tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside of it. It can cause pelvic pain, cramps, delayed periods, and difficulty concentrating.\n3. Ovarian cysts: Cysts that develop on the ovaries can sometimes cause lower abdominal pain, delayed periods, and discomfort during activities like bending down.\n4. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): PCOS is a hormonal disorder that can cause irregular periods, lower abdominal pain, and difficulty concentrating.\n5. Ectopic pregnancy: Although the pregnancy test was negative, an ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. It can cause lower abdominal pain, delayed periods, and sometimes a warm feeling or discomfort.\n6. Uterine fibroids: Fibroids are noncancerous growths in the uterus that can cause lower abdominal pain, cramps, and delayed periods.\n7. Ovarian torsion: This occurs when an ovary twists, potentially causing severe lower abdominal pain, cramps, and delayed periods.\n8. Gastrointestinal issues: Certain gastrointestinal conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can cause lower abdominal pain and difficulty concentrating.\n9. Stress or anxiety: High levels of stress or anxiety can lead to physical symptoms like abdominal discomfort, delayed periods, and difficulty concentrating.\n10. Hormonal imbalances: Imbalances in hormones such as estrogen and progesterone can affect the menstrual cycle, leading to delayed periods and associated symptoms.\"\n\nThird try, here's the whole conversation:\n\nChatGPT: \"I'm not a doctor, but based on the symptoms you described, here's a list of ten possible conditions that could explain a woman's false pregnancy test, missed period, muscle pain, localized cramps, fatigue, and emotional changes:\n\n1. Pregnancy: While the pregnancy test was false, it's still possible for a woman to be pregnant and have a negative result, especially if the test was taken too early. In some cases, pregnancy symptoms can manifest even with a negative test result.\n2. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): PCOS is a hormonal disorder that can cause irregular periods, muscle pain, and emotional changes.\n3. Uterine fibroids: Fibroids are noncancerous growths in the uterus that can lead to missed periods, muscle pain, and localized cramps.\n4. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS): PMS is a condition that can cause muscle pain, cramps, fatigue, and emotional changes in the days leading up to the menstrual period.\n5. Hormonal imbalances: Imbalances in hormones like estrogen and progesterone can disrupt the menstrual cycle, leading to missed periods, muscle pain, and emotional symptoms.\n6. Thyroid disorders: Conditions such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism can cause hormonal imbalances, leading to missed periods, muscle pain, fatigue, and emotional changes.\n7. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS): CFS is a complex disorder characterized by persistent fatigue that lasts for at least six months and is not relieved by rest. Muscle pain and emotional symptoms can also be present.\n8. Fibromyalgia: Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and emotional changes.\n9. Post-acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS): PAWS can occur after substance addiction recovery and can cause various physical and psychological symptoms, including muscle pain, fatigue, and emotional instability.\n10. Psychological factors: Emotional changes, fatigue, and muscle pain can also be influenced by psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, or depression.\n\nIt's important for her to consult with a healthcare professional who can conduct a thorough evaluation, consider her medical history, and perform appropriate tests to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms.\"\n\nME: But if she is actually having pain, would that really be psychological? Because if she is stressed, wouldn't the pain be causing her stress and anxiety?\n\nChatGPT: \"You're right, pain itself is a physical symptom and should not be dismissed as purely psychological. Stress and anxiety can indeed contribute to the experience of pain, and in some cases, they can amplify or exacerbate physical symptoms.\n\nWhen it comes to pain, it's essential to consider both physical and psychological factors. Stress and anxiety can lead to muscle tension, which may manifest as muscle pain. Additionally, psychological factors can influence how pain is perceived and experienced, affecting an individual's emotional well-being and overall stress levels.\n\nIt's crucial to approach the situation with a holistic perspective. A healthcare professional would take into account the individual's symptoms, medical history, conduct a physical examination, and potentially order additional tests to determine the underlying cause of the pain. They will consider both physical and psychological factors to provide a comprehensive diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\"\n\nME: Aren't you afraid that by including psychological disorders, that you'd be perpetuating the old and misinformed idea of hysteria? \n\nChatGPT: \"I apologize if my previous response gave the impression of perpetuating outdated notions or stigmatizing psychological disorders. It is not my intention to promote such ideas.\n\nIt is important to approach health and well-being from a biopsychosocial perspective, recognizing that physical symptoms can be influenced by various factors, including psychological ones. Mental health is an essential component of overall health, and it is crucial to consider the interconnectedness of physical and psychological well-being.\n\nHowever, it is equally important to emphasize that physical symptoms should not be dismissed or solely attributed to psychological factors without appropriate evaluation. Healthcare professionals aim to provide comprehensive and individualized care, considering all potential causes and utilizing evidence-based practices for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIf you have concerns about the portrayal or understanding of psychological disorders, I encourage you to engage in open dialogue with healthcare professionals and seek information from reputable sources to ensure accurate and compassionate perspectives are shared.\"\n\n.\n\n So, from what I've seen it tells me that ChatGPT is going to be more reliable than googling your symptoms, using WebMD symptom checker, or anything else, and honestly it probably will help you be more successful at determining whether or not you actually need to go to the doctor. And will take into account your symptoms on an equal level. It is probably going to be better at determining comorbid conditions.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nShare with me. Tell me your experiences like this, at ANY time where you felt that someone ignored you, disrespected your body, didn't listen to you when it was important, told you to \"just suck it up\" when you shouldn't. Share with me any time a doctor didn't listen to you or ignored your symptoms. Share with me any time ANYONE discounted how you felt, what you believed, the way you dress/dress/who you are/ANYTHING. If not, share with me what you think, what you have to say. I want to know what everyone has to say.\n\nThis problem of the medical field not listening to women has GOT TO STOP. \n\nTLDR: This misinformation that dates back to 1900BC, which labels \"Hysteria\" to be pain in a major organ system (like the uterus/ovaries) and brain fog (symptom of period pains/PMDD/ADHD/epilepsy/etc. the list goes on) is the head contributor to this social ideology that we live in today, which is present in the workplace, day to day life, in relationships, the medical field, and so much more.",
