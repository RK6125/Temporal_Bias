    "text": "Deciding whether or not to nominate my line manager for a company award On mobile so I apologise before we get into it all.\n\nI work for a medium sized charity in the UK as part of a team of 10 including our director. The CEO has just launched a company awards scheme and you can nominate people if you think they deserve them.\n\nI wanted to nominate my line manager for the 'mentor' award because they've effectively created an unofficial mentoring program with me and has taken a real interest in my career progression which I'm incredibly grateful for.\n\nThe problem is is that it's a small team and the nominations process isn't anonymous. I want to do a nice thing for my line manager, however I don't want to get a reputation as a brown noser or a suck up, especially given the size of the team. People can be extremely petty, and whilst we have a great working relationship, we've struggled as a department with other departments before. \n\nIf anyone has any words of wisdom that would be greatly appreciated! \n\nShould I nominate her regardless of any effect this might have on my reputation amongst the larger organisation or should I find an alternative way to show how appreciative I am of her efforts?\n\nThanks!",
