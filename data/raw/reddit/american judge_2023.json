I had a teacher a long time ago in high school, who was very old, tell me that my hair wasn’t appropriate for the job I wanted, which was accounting at the time. I’m wondering what other people think about this because this is a topic that’s been on my mind for a few years now as I’m about to graduate. What does everyone think I would like to know as many opinions as possible. Especially if you’re a recruiter or supervisor.",

    "text": "WOMEN OF WISCONSIN: Get ready to vote tomorrow in one of the biggest elections in modern U.S. history that no one's ever heard of. The swing vote on the State Supreme Court is up for grabs, where a victory for liberal JANET PROTASIEWICZ will almost certainly overturn the state's total abortion ban Here's an article going into more about what's at stake:\n\n* https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-supreme-court-abortion-redistricting-trump-df0a7e5cfec1cd3bf08f14270a1c9615\n\nAfter Roe v. Wade fell last year, a trigger law from the year 1849 - over a decade before the start of the American Civil War that ended Chattel Slavery - banned abortion in the state. Despite a Democratic Governor ready to sign a repeal, the Republican controlled state legislature has opposed it, and a 4-3 conservative State Supreme Court slow walked the legal challenge. \n\nHowever, one of the 4 conservative justices, Patience D. Roggensack, is term limited, and the state elects SCOTUS judges by a vote so the race tomorrow will effectively determine control of the now deadlocked 3-3 court. A win for Judge Janet will give liberals a majority for the first time in 15 years, ensuring a liberal majority court will now have the final say on the legal challenge to the 1849 abortion ban, and in almost 100% likelihood, throw it in the trash.\n\nAND THAT'S NOT ALL \n\nWisconsin is victim to the worst Republican gerrymander in the country, where the maps are so rigged that Republicans only need 40% of the vote to control a majority of the state legislature, while Democrats need a 60% supermajority! Watchdogs have called it one of the most dangerous affronts to democracy in the Developed World. The conservative State Supreme Court has done nothing to address this, but a new liberal court majority is very likely to lead to a legal challenge against the maps. If overturned, Democrats would go to having a fair chance of winning a majority in the state legislature and turning the state fully blue like Michigan and Minnesota recently did. It would ensure that not only the monstrous 1849 abortion ban would be overturned, but Republicans would struggle to get back the legislature to ban it all over again. Right now all they need is the Governor's Mansion. \n\nJanet's opponent, Dan Kelly, is a hardline conservative backed by the three biggest anti-abortion groups in the state. He was part of a scheme to throw out Joe Biden's victory in Wisconsin in 2020 by sending an alternative slate of electors to vote for Donald Trump instead. He is a mad man, and is very likely to uphold the 1849 ban as well as the maps.\n\nLadies, however you can, GET OUT AND VOTE FOR JANET!!!",

The police pressured the victim to drop the charges of assault and deprivation of liberty.

Former policewoman Luana Radu is alleged to have been the contact**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe investigation into the case of brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, who are in pre-trial detention after being charged with human trafficking and rape, has also brought to light possible abuses committed by some Voluntari police officers. They allegedly tried to persuade at least one victim of the Tate brothers and their two female accomplices to drop the charges.\n\nThe arrest of the two Britons has raised questions about how, from 2016 until the end of 2022, they managed to raise millions of euros from the sexual exploitation of young women without ever getting into trouble with the law, especially in the context of the human trafficking charges brought by DIICOT prosecutors in December, when they also arrested them.\n\nJudicial sources revealed to Gândul that the Tate brothers did in fact get into trouble with the law, but were allegedly helped by some Voluntari police workers.\n\nIn this sense, it would be an incident that took place before the first searches in April 2022, when the villa of brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, in Pipera, was raided by the police of Ilfoveni, mobilized after a referral from the US Embassy. At the time, the diplomatic staff informed the police that a young woman, an American citizen, had been lured to Romania and kidnapped in a villa in Pipera, where an attempt was being made to sexually exploit her in a videochat studio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The case was closed**\n\nDuring the investigation, which reached DIICOT shortly after the April 2022 searches, prosecutors established that at least one woman had gone to Voluntari police headquarters to complain that she had been kidnapped in the building where the Tate brothers' videochat studio was set up, and had been beaten there by former police officer Luana Alexandra Radu and Georgiana Naghel.\n\nThe victim allegedly managed to escape from the videochat studio to the Voluntari police, where she filed a complaint.\n\nAccording to the sources cited, the police officer who recorded her complaint would then also have called Luana Alexandra Radu to the Voluntari Police headquarters, where he would have recommended her as his \"former colleague\".\n\nThe policeman allegedly insisted that the woman complaining that she had been kidnapped and assaulted drop the charges. Subsequently, sources say, the case was closed by the investigators of Ilfoveni.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Britons Andrew and Tristan Tate arrested in Romania for human trafficking**\n\nBrothers Andrew and Tristan Tate, together with Georgiana Naghel and Luana Alexandra Radu, received their first pre-trial arrest warrants on 30 December 2022, after being detained by DIICOT prosecutors the day before, following raids on their villa in Pipera and videochat studio.\n\nOn 20 January, at the request of the prosecutors, the Bucharest Court extended their remand warrants for a further 30 days, from 29 January to 27 February. Although the decision is not final and has already been challenged by the Tate brothers' lawyers, they remain in custody at least until 28 January, the last day of the first arrest warrant. In the coming days, the Bucharest Court of Appeal is due to decide whether Andrew and Tristan Tate and their two accomplices will remain in pre-trial detention or will be released or placed under house arrest from 29 January.\n\nThe DIICOT prosecutors managed to convince the Bucharest court judge to extend the Tate brothers' arrest warrants, arguing that if they are released they \"may exercise psychological control over the victims\".\n\nProsecutors also say that brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate could flee Romania if released from custody. In the context, DIICOT prosecutors used an earlier statement by one of the two eccentric millionaires, in which he said he had accounts in 19 countries around the world and could fly using several passports.\n\n\"If I make a mistake and England wants me in jail, I can fly with a Nigerian or American or English or Polish or Estonian passport. I have bank accounts in 19 countries,\" prosecutors quoted a statement by one of the Tate brothers in the indictment.\n\nThe arguments and evidence presented by the DIICOT prosecutors convinced the Bucharest court to extend their pre-trial detention warrants for another 30 days, and the judge considered that leaving them at large \"would create real risks for the proper conduct of the criminal trial\".\n\nAndrew and Tristan Tate are accused of \"setting up an organised criminal group in 2021 with a view to committing the crime of trafficking in human beings on the territory of Romania and other countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom\".\n\n\"The victims were then transported and sheltered in buildings in Ilfov county where, through acts of physical violence and psychological coercion (through intimidation, constant surveillance, control and the invocation of alleged debts), were sexually exploited by members of the group by being forced to engage in pornographic acts with a view to producing and disseminating material of such a nature via social media platforms and by being forced to perform forced labour in order to obtain significant financial benefits consisting of sums of money obtained as a result of users accessing the material\", according to the DIICOT.",

Listen to your body and don't let embarrassment stop you from seeking treatment.\n\n\\*\n\nWriting this post from my hospital bed. As a 28 year old, I never expected to have a bilateral [pulmonary embolism](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-embolism/symptoms-causes/syc-20354647), but here I am.\n\n\"About a quarter of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, **the first symptom of pulmonary embolism is death.**\" (American Heart Association [article](https://www.heart.org/en/news/2021/11/23/pulmonary-embolism-is-common-and-can-be-deadly-but-few-know-the-signs))\n\n\\*\n\nFor weeks now I've had bouts of shortness of breath, mostly while walking around or going up and down stairs. Generally I was embarrassed and felt like I was super out of shape, saying things to myself like \"jeez magpie2295, you really gotta exercise more\". I was really putting myself down and blamed recent weight gain. I know, I know, sometimes we can't help but be pulled into the cultural anti-fat bias, especially when it comes to judging ourselves.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the wildfire smoke rolled into my town and I couldn't go more than five minutes walking without feeling like I'd just run a mile. I chalked it up to the smoke, some mild asthma, and again a general out of shape-ness. I bought a HEPA filter and slowly recovered.\n\nThree days ago I went to the beach with my mom and had a horrendous time breathing. Couldn't walk more than ten feet without needing to sit down and recover. I knew something wasn't right, took some Albuterol, thought, \"I'll schedule an appointment somewhere when I get home\". **I had no idea that I should have been rushing to the ER.**\n\nI had a whole-ass dissertation due in three days. I had a cat who needed feeding. I didn't have time for medical mishaps.\n\nOn the drive back from the beach, I called my dad and told him what had happened. Reader, I am so so so SO grateful to tell you that my dad is a *pulmonologist* (lung doctor) (yes, the irony). He was super concerned and told me to go straight to the ER \"just in case\" and to rule out a pulmonary embolism \"to make your dad happy\". I rolled my eyes, joked that I'd only go if he paid my ER bill, and drove to the hospital.\n\nWell, here I still am, three days later, dad's snoozing in the hospital chair beside my bed. Massive blood clots in both lungs. Eventually, those clots would have made my heart strain so hard I would have keeled over and died. Yep. **My dad saved my life**, and had I not listened to him or to what my body was telling me, had I continued to downplay my symptoms and health-shame myself, I would likely be dead.\n\nI'm still reeling from the implications. Physically I'm doing fine, they've got me on blood thinners and I'm going home today. Mentally? I feel like I just stepped off a train track a second before a steam engine blew by.\n\nI'll have to wait a bit for some genetic clotting disorder testing, but the overall consensus is that **hormonal birth control contributed to my risk factors** and tipped me over the edge into clot territory.\n\nListen to your body. If something isn't right, and especially if that something is shortness of breath for no reason, please get checked out. I'm not saying \"don't take the Pill\" but please, be cognizant when someone tells you about side effects and risks.\n\n\\*\n\nI searched on the sub for others with this issue and there hasn't been a post in a while, so here's your annual PSA to be careful with birth control and blood clots.\n\n[Here's an article from the Cleveland Clinic with more info.](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/yes-your-birth-control-could-make-you-more-likely-to-have-a-blood-clot/)\n\n**Edit:** I also should mention that this is not what caused my case, but risks for P.E. is the reason that people tell you to get up and walk around while on airplanes or long car rides. Being sedentary for too long means blood pools in your legs and you increase the risk of clotting.\n\n**Edit 2**: Someone asked in the comments; I was taking Sprintec, if the medication matters to anyone. This is a risk with *any* hormonal BC though!",

    "text": "One Year Later: The Repurcussians of Anti-abortion Legislation It has been a year since the Supreme Court stripped women of their nearly 50 year right to make their own reproductive health-care decisions. This is the result. \n\n1) For the first time ever, a majority of Americans say abortion is morally acceptable and recent abortion laws are too strict.\n\n2) For the first time in two decades, more people identify as pro-choice than pro-life.\n\n3) For the first time in 49 years, “The Dobbs decision transferred all-or-nothing disputes to the states” (Wall Street Journal), an undue burden on state supreme courts.\n\n4) A recent NBC News poll found voters who oppose the court’s actions include 55 percent of men, 67 percent of women, 66 percent of suburban women, 77 percent of female voters ages 18-49, 92 percent of Democrats, 60 percent of independents and 31 percent of Republicans.\n\n5) A March17 - May 18 Kaiser Family Foundation survey of 569 OBGYN doctors revealed shocking findings: “68 percent found the [Dobbs] ruling has worsened their ability to manage pregnancy-related emergencies, [and] has worsened pregnancy-related mortality (64 percent), racial and ethnic inequities in maternal health (70 percent) and the ability to attract new OBGYNs to the field (55 percent).”\n\n6) Michele Goodwin, a legal expert in bioethics and health law, notes “A dramatic proliferation in anti-abortion legislation in the United States has coincided with this nation becoming the deadliest in the `developed world’ to be pregnant and attempt to give birth” (Ms., May 24, 2022).\n\n7) Black women are 3.5 times more likely to die due to maternal mortality than their white counterparts, unabated by abortion bans.\n\n8) The states with the highest maternal mortality rates also lead the nation in anti-abortion legislation.\n\n9) Isabella Oishi, Georgetown Law student, writes that since the Texas Heartbeat Act became law, it did not reduce the need for abortion care. Rather, there has been an 11-fold increase in Texans crossing state lines for abortions.\n\n10) Oishi further reveals that states prohibiting women to seek abortions in other states is “likely unconstitutional based on the right to travel, the Privileges and Immunities Clause and the Dormant Commerce Clause. The anti abortion legislation harkens back to the (1793) Fugitive Slave Act.”\n\n11) Federal judge, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, announced a constitutional right to abortion may be found in the 13th Amendment, ratified at the end of the Civil War in 1865 -- made slavery and involuntary servitude illegal. This is an area that was ignored by the Supreme Court.\n\n12) Andrew Koppelman, author of “Forced Labor: A Thirteenth Amendment Defense of Abortion,” writes “forced pregnancy’s violation of personal liberty is obvious. Restrictions on abortion also violate the 13th amendment’s guarantee of equality, because forcing women to be mothers makes them into a servant caste, a group that, by virtue of a status of birth, is held subject to a special duty to serve others and not themselves”.\n\n13) Elie Mystal, a legal scholar, wrote in the March 2022 issue of The Nation: “these anti-abortion states are borrowing traces of the sadistic logic and psychological tactics of this country’s enslavers.” As recently as June 29, Ja’han Jones, a research-based author, concurred with Mystal by noting “with abortion rights being rescinded across the country, it’s more important than ever that we call restrictions on this vital procedure what they actually are: slavery.”\n\nThe issues of pro-choice vs. pro-life, awareness of the 13th Amendment’s slavery and involuntary servitude prohibition, OBGYN doctor concerns, morality and maternal mortality have come center stage to voters and the 2024 election. GOP candidates will – most likely -- purposely ignore these multitude of findings while Democrats will tout women’s reproductive rights.\n\nSCOTUS’s 6-3 decision created this unnecessary chaos for 334 million Americans.\n\n[Source](https://thefulcrum.us/consequences-and-repercussions-scotus-dobbs)",

    "text": "Rant: middle age women complaining about how \"these young mothers just want to be comfortable\" and romanticizing struggle I (25f) am and will forever be childfree by choice. I feel as strong about being childfree as I feel about granting every parent out there the right to live their paternity/maternity at their fullest and enjoy it as comfortably as they can and their means allow. If needed I will physically fight anyone judging mothers for taking time off or \"getting themselves comfortable\" by things such as small as an electric breast pump, not breastfeeding or hiring a nanny for whenever they need some time away (trust me, i have seen a couple).\n\nSo my mom was having surgery today and I was sitting waiting for news in the same waiting room with a young mother and her girl , the baby was maybe less than a year and was sleeping in her arms, she decided to wait an hour for some lab results about her child's explosive dhiarrea or something and she did not want to go back home and come back in the afternoon because she had been spending lots of money on the childs issues recently and did not want to pay for transportation twice in a day. We were making small talk about how she is an engineering student at the same college i went to and teachers and blablablaa and she was also complaining about the lack of baby changing tables in the restrooms of a private center like that that had just recently been refurbished, we live in a town in a developing country but still, this is a new 4-story building that offers more than 20 specialties, for my money least they could is not have people chaging their babies diapers on a chair in the hallway. The restroom was right in front of where I was sitting and all of the sudden she goes like \"if I dont go now I will pee myself, would you hold her?\" I know this is not a normal practice but since I saw other people saw her ask me and it would be just a couple minutes I said yes. So I took the baby.\n\nComes a women who was also sitting with us and starts complaining about how irresponsible it is to just hand your child like that. I know, not the best but that girl took the fastest pee ever seen by a human, she literally came back less than 2 minutes after. And I was literally sitting in front of the door with like 20 witnesses of her giving me the kid, what was I going to do? Steal her? So this blonde middle age woman (i would say early 60s) goes on about how this is wrong and that's why kids nowadays are neglected because of \"free mothers\". I told her kind of trying to get her to calm down before the other women came from the restroom \"it's complicated because what was she going to do? Wear a diaper?\" Then she started on about how you are supposed to \"train your body\" when you have a child so you dont do things like that. Yeah, right, after 1 hour holding pee I would just pee myself but hey, the old lady is happy I did jot hand my child to someone else before going to pee.\n\nThen comes back the mother and takes the baby from me, same baby who happens to have taken the biggest and most liquid shit ever recorded in human history from such a small being. >! There was dark yellow-brownish-smelly stuff in my arm and I swear I regretted being alive in that moment. It was outside her diaper, on her pants and when the mother took her I also saw it in her back !< \n\nThe mother says sorry and lady #2 (Dominican version of your classic white-american Karen) starts explaining that that's why you dont give your child to strangers, because they dont have the same patience with your child that you have. I SAID NOTHING, PEOPLE, i did not complain although I was dying of ew inside, I even asked the mother if she wanted my wet towels when she said she had run out because the baby had been shitting all day and she could not clean her so well without changing tables so she wasted lots instead of her normal 4. In the end i just gave her the pack from my mom's bag although they are not the same brand as she had used, I think this lady was broke-ish because she did ask to take the whole pack or maybe she just didnt want to go to the pharmacy idk.\n\nThen goes lady Karen and starts telling us about how these mothers are so comfortable that end up not even wanting to breastfeed and are incapable of changing their baby diapers anywhere, then proceeds to explain how she had to change her baby's sometimes in buses because they were running late for some shit. I tried to explain how \"your generation had those struggles so we didnt have to have them\" to try to lighten the mood and we ended up changing topics. She also made comments about how baby carriers are not safe and end up creating \"trambotic\" babies. The word she used in spanish was \"bebés tullidos\", which is explicitly despective for someone with a discapacity. The mother I was talking to had an emptu baby carrier on her without using it, maybe for when the kid is awake idk.\n\nBut for the love of whatever god you believe in, it's two pm and you see a women who has been around with a baby since 6 am trying to figure out why she has fevers and crazy dhiarrea, you dont make comments like that. \n\nAnyway, too long post. I just hope this changes some day. I think people our age is going to be kinder with maternity and after this type of person (who I dont believe can change at this point) dies, we'll have a better world where most people can support others and help them get basic rights and acommondations to be parents and stop making other peoples struggles about ourselves or how we did it better.",

    "text": "An Open Letter to President Biden \\[Mods, please feel free to take down if this is not an appropriate space for this post.\\] \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPresident Biden,\n\nWhen you made the statement “I’m a practicing Catholic. I’m not big on abortion. But guess what? *Rove v. Wade* got it right” at an event in Maryland on June 27th, you reinforced the anti-choice notion that there is something morally objectionable to abortion. You passed judgment on millions of Americans whose circumstances you have not done enough to understand. And you gave cover to states and anti-choice activists to continue a path of exclusionary inclusion when their more extreme efforts fail. \n\nAllow me to explain: \n\nThe statement “*Roe v. Wade* got it right” is a nuanced legal argument. “I’m a practicing Catholic. I’m not big on abortion” is a moral judgment. “I’m not big on abortion” is essentially the same as saying “I have personal misgivings about this.” The next natural question someone would ask is “Why does he have personal misgivings about abortion?” Your first statement “I’m a practicing Catholic” provides the answer: your religion tells you to cast moral judgment on abortion. To label it as “bad” or otherwise undesirable. Perhaps even as something that takes a life?\n\nYou, Sir, are not simply a private citizen. A private citizen--even a friend--making a similar statement on abortion would not provoke such a public response in me. You are the President. Your words *must* be chosen measuredly. You have the responsibility to think about the ramifications of what you say. Hold whatever belief you want in private but think about what your beliefs signal before stating them in public.\n\nIn saying “I’m a practicing Catholic. I’m not big on abortion. But guess what? *Roe v. Wade* got it right” you essentially told anyone who has an abortion to remove an ectopic pregnancy (pregnancies that are *never* viable and *frequently* fatal) that the medical procedure that possibly saved their life is one that you think they should be able to access *legally*, but that you have *personal* misgivings about it:  you’re “not big on” it. You essentially told anyone who has an abortion because the fetus has an anomaly that is incompatible with sustained life outside the uterus that you think they should be able to access *legally*, but that you have personal misgivings and are “not big on” it. You essentially told anyone who has an abortion because they are the victims of rape or incest, or because they live in a household plagued by domestic violence, or cannot afford to bring another child into this world without their existing family falling into poverty, or simply cannot raise a child and finish their education and launch their career that you think they should be able to access *legally*, but that you have personal misgivings are are “not big on” it. \n\n*“But, wait! I didn’t say that! And besides, some of those circumstances are different!”*\n\nNot in your statement, they aren’t. You did not differentiate between types of abortion--and that is the one thing in your statement I actually am grateful for because the truth is: it is none of our damn business why someone has an abortion.\n\nBut, as I said, your statement does not distinguish between “good” and “bad” or “justified” and “unjustified” abortion. Rather, it paints all abortion as something that should be legal *to a point*, but certainly regulated to reflect the state’s interests, and--perhaps most importantly--privately judged. The fact that the Democratic President of the United States of America endorses this notion is more than just slightly disheartening. Have you not been listening when advocates were telling you *Roe* was never enough? That it needed to be a floor, not a ceiling? Have you yourself not seen the disastrous consequences of the last year as states banned or severely curtailed access to abortion? Have you yourself not seen the disastrous consequences of the Hyde Amendment and the Helms Amendment? Have you spent one moment talking to someone who needed to access an abortion and could? Or, needed to access an abortion and couldn’t?\n\nThe anti-choice side does not want to settle for an America (or world) in which abortion is legal and not heavily penalized. However, the anti-choice side will accept incremental wins and keep pushing. Over the past several decades the movement has been working to pass laws to outlaw abortion and, failing that, to severely restrict abortion. \n\nOne of the ramifications of abortion restrictions and the relentless anti-choice campaign has been the stigmatization of abortion and the labeling of it as something worthy of moral judgment (and therefore legal regulations). Legal regulations, in turn, create a system of exclusionary inclusion\\* whereby the procedure (and people engaging in it) are included in a highly regulated legal system in a manner that serves to exclude them from the norm and mark them as identifiable “others.” Mr. President, your acceptance of the standard set forth in *Roe* as an acceptable form of inclusion coupled with your moral judgment of abortion through the phrase “I’m a practicing Catholic. I’m not big on abortion” plays right into this. \n\n“I’m a practicing Catholic. I’m not big on abortion. But guess what? *Roe v. Wade* got it right.” With allies like you...*sheesh*. Until the decision in *Dobbs* stripped away bodily autonomy for over thirty-three million Americans, you couldn’t even bring yourself to say the word *abortion*. And now that you have? Well, maybe you ought to keep that word out of your mouth. \n\nSincerely,\n\nZimbardo Day\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Credit to Dr. Natasha Behl for coining the term exclusionary inclusion-- albeit in a different context.",

    "text": "Healthcare system and physician salary around the world. I am a Spanish doctor and I wonder how the different health systems around the world change, comparing their main advantages and disadvantages. I start with the system I know.\n\nIn Spain the health system has universal and free coverage (free for the patient; obviously it is paid through taxes). Totally free, if you need it they cover anything at 0 cost: Prosthesis of any joint, CAR-T cells treatment. Any surgery.\n\n**Advantages**: Everyone, regardless of their income, does not have to worry about being able to afford the best treatment available on the market. Reading some stories from the American healthcare system I think this is a big plus point.\n\n**Disadvantages**: For non-urgent procedures (osteoarthritis prostheses, cataract surgery...) there are long waiting lists (6 months-1 year); that if when it's your turn you don't pay a single euro.\n\nThis makes patients very demanding because they believe that everything is free. Patients come to the ER for months of pain because they know it's free and they also demand unnecessary tests. Sometimes they can even reproach you that if you don't do it, they pay your salary because they pay taxes (like they are your boss or something like taht xD)\n\nThe other main disadvantage is the salary of the doctors. A doctor who works in the public health system charges about 50K-60K with on-calls included (if you don't have on-calls you will find around 35K-45K).  The salary is independent of what specialty: a neurosurgeon earns exactly the same as an internist if he makes the same on-calls.  This means that the most competitive specialties to access are those that are related to aesthetics or have the possibility of completing your salary with a private practice, such as dermatology and plastic surgery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: At the request of the moderators I will try to offer a template to guide the answers.\n\n1) Description of access to the health system in your country or area.\n\n2) Advantages that you think it offers\n\n3) Disadvantages that you think it entails. \n\n  \n PLEASE I DON'T WANT THIS POST TO BE CONVERTED IN ANY POLITICAL DEBATE. IT IS NOT A POST TO JUDGE OTHER HEALTH SYSTEMS.\n\nI AM JUST CURIOUS TO KNOW OTHER HEALTH SYSTEMS AROUND THE WORLD AND THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES THAT EACH ONE INCLUDES BOTH FOR PATIENTS AND FOR DOCTORS.",

    "text": "Explaining US labor law: \"Right to work\" & \"At-will\" employment Many people are confused by two common terms related to employment in the USA: \"right to work\" and \"at-will employment\". This post will attempt to demystify both.\n\n**Q. What are \"right to work\" (RTW) laws?**\n**A.** American states are divided, because some have these laws and others don't. You'd think from the name that they help working people. But in reality, they do the opposite and were misleadingly named for political purposes.\n\nUnions get workers higher wages and better working conditions once they start having impact in a certain workplace. The union needs to maintain a high membership rate to retain the leverage that allows that. But when some workers start freeloading at a union workplace, benefiting from these better conditions but refusing to join the union, the union weakens, and the conditions worsen over time. RTW laws prohibit union security agreements, which are powerful tools for preventing such freeloading.\n\nAs such, they weaken unions. Some people think unions are useless in states with RTW laws, but that's wrong. It should also be mentioned that generally speaking, every individual worker benefits far more from being part of the union than it costs.\n\n**Q. What is \"at-will\" employment?**\n**A.** In simple terms, it means the company's owners can fire workers for pretty much any reason, except illegal reasons (in the USA, some types of discrimination, anti-union retaliation, etc). That would differ from \"just-cause\" employment. In the latter case, the standard that must be met to fire an employee is higher.\n\nIn the U.S. \"at-will\" employment is permitted by law in most states. But even in these states, workers may have a contract with the company that provides more job security. That's often the case in union workplaces. In other countries, things may be different. The law may only allow workers to be fired for certain approved reasons, such as repeated unjustified absences.\n\n**Q. Do RTW or at-will states allow companies to legally fire workers for supporting unions?**\n**A.** All U.S. states prohibit company retaliation against workers for supporting, promoting, or organizing a union, except in certain circumstances. Workers may receive restitution up to getting their job restored with back pay depending on how the NLRB judges their case. That's not guaranteed, however, since the laws often aren't enforced accurately. And when they are, there can be long delays and other trouble.\n\n**Q. What should I do if I want to have the advantages of unions at my workplace?**\n**A.** You'll find useful information at [join-a-union.github.io](https://join-a-union.github.io).\n\n**Note**: This post does not officially constitute legal advice nor comes with any legal guarantee of accuracy or otherwise.",

My life is pathetic right now but I want to make it better. :(\n\n\r  \n**\\*\\*Sorry about the long post and any grammar and spelling error.\\*\\***\n\n\r  \nI am 35 (F), I graduated high school ages ago. Since high school, I started working at my current part time job at a retail store. I have been at this job for a really long time, almost 17 years, I hate it here. I have thought of quitting this job many times but I don't know what other kind of job I can have? No one will hire me, ever. I do not have any disability, but I also do not have any qualification for any other kind of job. I have been looking for jobs but I don't want to work at retail stores or any other kind of stores. I want to do a job where I will be able to grow and learn.\n\n\r  \nNow, you might wonder why am I still doing this part-time job for 17 years that I hate so much?\n\n\r  \nSee, I had a plan. My plan was to go college, graduate and live the happy American life that every normal American gets to live. After graduating high school I went to college but I flunked out. Then I went to my local community college as a part time student for a few years but I kept flunking out. I got so depressed from flunking out of college all the time and being placed under academic probation that I finally decided to quit studying. I was so lost, I was thinking of ending everything. But I stuck around and I am still here. :( \n\nI am not a college/classroom type student. I learn better without any textbooks and exams. I have been like that since I was child but of course I never realized that's how I learn until two-three years ago. Now I am even more lost, because all my life I was told, 'I am stupid, not a smart person, I lack so much knowledge.' I do have a problem when it comes to studying, there are times I also do not understand some of the materials. So, yes I am stupid for flunking out of college, I am an unknowledgeable person for not having a four years college degree. But despite all that I went back to school earlier this year and I didn't do well, again. Whatever problem I have with studying, I need to resolve that. I am not going to quit studying, if everyone else can do it then why can't I do it? \n\nThat's why I am finally thinking of quitting my current but old job. Since I don't have any experience or qualification for any other kind of jobs, can someone advise me or suggest what other kind of job I can look for that will hire a 35 years old, high school graduate, with little to no experience? I do have good customer service skills, I am alright with using Microsoft words and stuff, I am a quick learner, I am very detail oriented but that's all I am good at. Please, any advice will be helpful. :(  \n\n\nThank you.",

    "text": "RN looking to transition to something creative and lucrative - is mechanical engineering right for me? I've been an RN for 7+ years in multiple areas. I knew in my first semester of school I'd made a mistake, but due to my conservative, religious upbringing I stuck with it (intense feelings of responsibility to serve others, satisfy parents, limited exposure to routes outside of teacher/RN/\"MRS\" degree as a female, yada yada). I'm a violinist and had natural talent when younger, winning solo competitions, concertmistress of university orchestra, etc. My dream was to do studio work for movies and theater. It's a highly competitive field and once nursing took over my life my skills atrophied to a large degree, so it's not an option anymore. I grieve daily for the life I wish I'd gone for, and I need to move forward to something I CAN do.\n\nThe things I excel in sadly don't make money or have endless job openings. I'm a pretty even mix of right and left-brained attributes, having done well academically in science and math, but my interests lie in creativity, working with my hands, using my imagination. I minored in film, I enjoy DIY projects from laying tile to making my own furniture hardware, and my nerdiest hobby is SFX makeup - I geek out on SFX production, my love being prosthetics and animatronics - think the transformation scene in An American Werewolf in London. I'm an introvert, have ADHD combined type, loathe customer service, and need a work environment in which I'm not judged on my process, but in my outcome.\n\nI feel engineering could be a decent fit that would open doors to a better salary/benefits, challenge me, and involve creativity and problem-solving. I'd absolutely love to work in entertainment for companies like Weta FX or TAIT, or anything in a related area. With all this in mind -\n\n\\- does engineering sound realistic for me (both in entertainment and in general)?\n\n\\- is mechanical engineering a good route to the specific areas I'd love to work in? If likelihood of such niche careers is minimal, can I find a job as a ME that still utilizes high amounts of creativity?\n\n\\- I'm thinking of going the route of 2-year associate's via community college to then transfer to 4-year school for degree. Thoughts? Alternatives?\n\n\\- are there any career possibilities I'm not aware of that may be a better/equivalent fit? (Compensation is important - I need $70k+ for Seattle, WA, as I'm single and unwilling to make a lateral financial move for the sake of my retirement goals.\n\nThank you!!",

    "text": "Is this subreddit only for Americans? What exactly is a law school? Hello guys. I have a couple of questions.\n\nFirst of all, I am a Polish law student. I dream of becoming a judge after obtaining my Master's Degree. I wonder, am I not allowed to browse and post here? Is this subreddit only for Americans? All I see are Americans here.\n\nI wonder - we in Europe have a different legal system than in America. As far as I understand, the American law is based upon the rulings of courts. Not the case here. The law is created with bills passed through the the parliament. I wonder, do Americans generally see their system as a superior one?\n\nAlso, I don't want to sound like an idiot, but exactly is a law school? Here, we study law the same way as we study any other course. My university has a Law faculty in the same way as it has a Physics faculty, which is located just 100 metres away. Law is not really a different course than any of the other ones. Why do Americans refer to, \"Law School\" and not just, \"studying Law at a uni\"?\n\nAlso, I wonder about the following - Polish Law graduates have to undergo a three year long practice in order to become a judge, attorney etc. is it the same in America?\n\nEdit: I am sad that people did not like the post, I was just curious.\n\nHere's more info about becoming a lawyer in Poland, in this case it's about attorneys. Look under, \"how to become an attorney\".\n https://kirp.pl/the-profession-of-an-attorney-at-law-in-poland/\n\nPoland, like many European countries, has two levels of PhD holders - the standard PhD holderz (*doktorzy*) and the higher level PhD holders, called *doktorzy habilitowani*. If you are a *doktor habilitowany*, you can become a judge, attorney, bailiff etc. without having to undergo the 3 year long training.",

Congrats on starting law school this month. I originally posted this guide a few years ago as a 2L, and have received countless messages ever since about how helpful it was. I repost it every year around this time so that the new incoming 1Ls could see it and hopefully find it useful too. Here are the posts from prior years in case you find the discussions in the comments section useful:\n\n\n[Fall 2022 - /r/lawschooladmissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/wuzs4n/how_to_get_good_grades_in_1l_while_staying_sane/)\n\n\n[Fall 2022 - /r/lawschool](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/wuzs0g/how_to_get_good_grades_in_1l_while_staying_sane/)\n\n\n\n[Fall 2021 - /r/lawschooladmissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/pcomm7/how_to_succeed_in_1l_detailed_advice_from_a/)\n\n\n\n[Fall 2021 - /r/lawschool](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/pcompf/how_to_succeed_in_1l_detailed_advice_from_a/)\n\n\n\n[Spring 2021- /r/lawschool](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/kvwwgp/hoping_for_better_grades_in_the_spring_heres_a/)\n\n\n\n[Fall 2020 - /r/lawschooladmissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/idcu40/for_overwhelmed_1ls_a_comprehensive_guide_on_how/)\n\n\n\n[Fall 2020 - /r/lawschool](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/idcs25/for_overwhelmed_1ls_a_comprehensive_guide_on_how/)\n\n\nWhen I was a 1L, I was lucky enough to get lots of sage advice from Reddit, TLS, and older students at UVA. I wanted to pay it forward, and ask you to do the same. This guide represents all of the things I personally learned myself, advice I received over the years, and comments by dozens of top-performing students at UVA and other T14s who have given me feedback and helped me improve the contents. Historically, my 1L mentees who followed this guide have performed extremely well (including several with a 4.0 at schools like UVA, Penn, and Michigan, though obviously that requires a lot more than just following my advice lol).\n\n\n\n\nYou should also check out **[this post about what to do in the last month before finals (ie how to outline etc.), and how the hell you actually write the exam when you're sitting in the room on test day](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/ykbw18/how_to_study_for_finals_in_the_last_30_days_and/).**\n\n\n\nRemember that there is no \"right way\" to do law school, *including* my advice in this guide. You should listen to as much guidance as you can, then try things and decide what works for you personally. Nobody grades you on how you prepared, only on the final result in the exam room. **[This post by moderator Hstrat](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/ng7e4z/aggregated_content_for_rising_1ls_and_others/)** contains a priceless collection of other guides and AMAs across the internet that you should read as well, including some that helped me as a 1L several years ago. I recommend paying attention to even the ones that disagree with me :)\n\n\n*2022 update: Several people have asked me recently when I was going to post my \"updated\" guide, so I wanted to confirm that I've gone through the whole post again and while there are a handful of tweaks, most of the advice holds true. I've also been asked to add advice about how to get jobs, how to do well in BigLaw, etc. but this post is already dangerously close to the Reddit character limit so I think I'll have to save that stuff for a separate guide :)*\n\n\nFeel free to ask any questions below, and again, commentary and contributions from other people who got good grades is welcome! Happy to also answer questions beyond studying if anyone wants to ask them (about career choices, my experiences in biglaw, whatever).\n\n**Caveats/Intro**\n\n* No advice is “correct” (including this), just suggestions to try for yourself\n* No one will ever see your notes/outlines/flashcards/etc, only the exam itself\n* The exam is 100% of your grade, so focus on that\n\n   * Your entire semester should work backwards from the exam\n   * Obviously if your syllabus says otherwise, adjust accordingly\n\n**Sleep/health/caffeine/drinking**\n\n* Your physical and mental health are important for obvious human reasons  \n\n   * They are ALSO critically important for grades\n* 1L is a marathon, not a sprint\n* You WILL burnout eventually  \n\n   * The question is when, how bad, and how fast can you bounce back?\n   * Delaying burnout and mitigating its intensity is key; health is critical to this\n* The increased brainpower, efficiency, and speed of being healthy, well-rested, and mentally/emotionally centered vastly outpaces any time “lost” from not studying more\n* Specifically: Sleep, exercise, diet, relaxation, reasonable levels of caffeine/alcohol/drugs  \n\n   * Sleep is absolute king here\n   * An hour of sleep is more valuable than an hour of anything else, including studying, job applications, exercise, socializing, etc. because it  makes all of those activities way better/easier during the rest of the  day\n\n**General life/social stuff**\n\n* Warn your family, friends, partner, etc. that law school is really intense and that 1L Fall is by far the most important semester  \n\n   * It will NOT be that bad, but it’s wise to set their expectations low and have them be pleasantly surprised that you’re available, rather than be mad that you’re not available enough\n   * They should be under the impression that your life will be 100% taken up by studying, until you’re comfortable enough with your schedule to inform them otherwise\n* Be nice to everyone, don’t start drama  \n\n   * This is all so much easier when you get along\n   * Contribute to and take advantage of the support network!\n   * Remember that every classmate will also be lawyer, in a very small world, and it’s better to be friends with the hiring partner, opponent, client, attorney general, judge, whatever than to have them remember when you tried to fight them on the softball field lol\n\n**Pacing/high-level overview**\n\n* Common mistakes: burnout too early, or (less common) slack until the end  \n\n   * You CANNOT push yourself round the clock in the library all day every day all semester – literally nobody can keep up this pace forever  \n\n      * Every year people try this, burn themselves out, and get wrecked in finals\n   * You should assume that you are totally average until 1L grades tell you otherwise  \n\n      * If you’re insecure that you’re not smart enough, you’re probably wrong (chances are you’re average)\n      * If you’re overconfident because you think you’re smarter than everyone else, you’re also probably wrong (chances are you’re average too)\n* You need a plan, and it should be ambitious but reasonable  \n\n   * Plan for problems/interruptions/sickness/distraction\n   * Leave slack in your schedule each week, and across the semester as a whole\n* Each hour of your time becomes more valuable the closer you get to finals  \n\n   * Thus, try to front-load tasks as much as possible without burning out\n\n**Work backwards from the exam**\n\n* The exam is the only thing that matters\n* Repeat: **THE EXAM IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS**  \n\n   * Plan the entire semester based on this realization\n   * Cases are important for learning, but pretty unimportant for the exam  \n\n      * Repeat: they *ARE important*, just not while sitting in the exam\n* So start by figuring out: what does the exam look like?  \n\n   * **NOTE**: Check the format with your professor, on the off-chance that it’s different… but most will be like this:\n   * A series of hypotheticals that you will need to analyze, often w/ little guidance, and write about in a Word doc for the professor (at some schools this may be done via special exam software but the content is the same)\n   * Extreme time pressure\n   * (Usually) open-book, open-note, even open-internet\n   * Blind grading (professor has no idea who you are)  \n\n      * Notably, they also don't know whether you nailed a cold call or bombed it\n   * Cases are used only for their key takeaway/rule, and maybe to analogize the most important facts to the exam hypo  \n\n      * *At most* you might say something like “Necessity is not a defense to murder (*Dudley*), so in this case John wouldn’t be able to raise it.”\n      * Or something like, “The workers here are independent contractors, but unlike the anesthesiologists in *Roessler*, they don’t seem to have apparent authority.”\n      * This kind of unofficial “citation” to a case is not only the maximum you’d have to do, it’s honestly more than most professors would expect or care about – you DO NOT have to even use cases to this degree\n      * The point is, a few days/weeks from now, when you’re spending so much time learning cases, reflect back on these examples in this post, and realize how little information you’ll actually use from them on the exam\n* So, now that you know what the exam involves, what sorts of tools would probably help you during the exam?  \n\n   * A gigantic, well-organized document with all the information from the class, that you can CTRL-F to find things  \n\n      * This is an “outline”\n   * Your raw class notes to CTRL-F in case you missed something  \n\n      * This is why you should take good notes\n   * A shorter document laying out only the most important info as a reminder, that you can glance at quickly mid-exam  \n\n      * This is an “attack outline”\n   * Other visual aids?

But be prepared to adapt to your own way, or toss them out\n* I have way more to say about exam nitty-gritty and strategy, but that should wait until much later in the semester  \n\n   * When the time comes, check out my post about [preparing for exams during the final month of the semester](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/dtiy6y/detailed_game_plan_for_finals_for_all_the_anxious/), followed by my post detailing [specific strategies for writing the exam itself once you're sitting in it](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/e7m4uz/for_1ls_a_detailed_guide_on_how_the_hell_you/)\n\n**Taking notes in class**\n\n* By far the most important thing you can do\n* The professor is judge, jury, and executioner of your exam  \n\n   * If you, the book, or supplements ever disagree with the professor, the professor is always right (for the exam anyway)\n   * Many profs will encourage you to challenge their ideas, either in class or in office hours…. But when it comes to the exam, follow what they think\n   * If you get a policy/political question, you may choose to argue a point that your prof disagrees with, if it’s truly a debatable non-settled non-legal question  \n\n      * But when it comes to “how does Torts work” your prof is always correct\n* For most profs, 99.9% of the information you’ll need will come up in class at some point (either from the prof, or from discussion w/ students)  \n\n   * This is part of why devoting too much time to reading/briefing isn’t worth it – you’ll get the info in class\n* Pay attention, take lots of notes, fill any holes either by asking classmates, revisiting the recordings, or going to office hours\n* Do not create a separate Word document for each day of class, just combine all your notes for the same subject into one document so you can CTRL-F the entire semester of that subject in one go (ex. all Crim notes in a single doc, not \"Crim August 26th\" and \"Crim August 28th\")\n\n   * Trust me, this will save you enormous time and effort later\n   * You can also use more sophisticated tools like One Note if you know how\n* I strongly encourage you to type your notes (if the professor allows it) for the sake of speed and to save time transferring handwritten to electronic later, but there is no \"right\" answer on this one\n* If you handwrite, you will HAVE to transfer them to electronic form at  some point so you can use them for outlining and during the exam  \n\n   * Probably smart to set up a routine for doing this each week or other similar time period\n* Follow whatever style and format works best for your brain - nothing else matters\n\n**Reading**\n\n* Timing: probably good to get ahead, at least by a couple days  \n\n   * Aspire to finish the semester’s reading early if you can\n   * By reading ahead, you leave room for problems (if you get sick or have some deadline or are burned out, the punishment is being back on normal pace, rather than falling behind)\n   * BUT consider that being too far ahead means you forget details and can mess up cold calls  \n\n      * Probably good to do a quick refresh right before class\n   * Start to track how long it takes to read each page (this may be different for each class)  \n\n      * Not to be a gunner, but so that you can accurately estimate time for each assignment\n      * You *will* get faster as the semester goes on (often significantly faster) - this is part of the normal law school process\n* Read every word carefully the first time through, but read it like a normal book and don't get bogged down for long if you're confused - either the book will explain it later, or the professor will explain it in class\n* Try really hard to understand what’s going on factually and legally\n* Try to figure out how each judge is making their arguments\n* In your head, practice distilling the key questions:  \n\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, what are the facts?\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, what legal rule comes out of this?\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, what did the dissent say (if any)?\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, is there any other context/info from book?\n   * Ex. *R v. Dudley & Stevens*  \n\n      * Facts: “Two guys starving on boat eat third guy”\n      * Law: “Rule: necessity is not a valid defense to murder”\n      * Context: “This is an old English case and American law is a bit different now”\n* You do NOT have to actually write these things down as you read, although you can if you want to  \n\n   * However….\n\n**Briefing**\n\n* CONTROVERSIAL: should you write down *all* of those facts, details, arguments, and legal minutiae from the reading?  \n\n   * This is called “briefing”\n   * Doing this is part of traditional law school advice, but highly controversial\n   * There seems to be a modern trend away from briefing\n   * **Personally, I am strongly against briefing and advise you to seriously consider not doing it**\n* Briefing pros:  \n\n   * Cold calls are way easier\n   * You never need to revisit the book because it’s all there\n   * Helps some people remember facts/arguments/details better\n   * May force you to understand things better\n* Briefing cons:  \n\n   * Takes an absolutely enormous amount of time\n   * Most of the information is unnecessary outside of cold calls\n   * Will never be used on an actual exam\n   * You can survive a cold call without it\n   * People often become too reliant on them as a crutch\n   * Seriously, an enormous f\\*cking amount of time\n* Some people swear by briefing, including some very successful students\n* But many, including me, think they’re a waste of time  \n\n   * The ratio of time required to value gained is insanely wasteful\n   * They mostly help cold calls… and cold calls have no impact on your grade\n   * Many people study tons of hours and burn out… yet get bad grades?  \n\n      * Too much time spent briefing is often the culprit - among the dozens of 1Ls I've mentored over the years, it's the most common problem they have\n      * Briefing *feels like* you’re being productive and *feels like* you’re “learning” and “being a good law student” and “accomplishing something”… but many people discover come exam time that **those efforts don’t translate into results**\n   * Easy to be too perfectionist or worry about things like formatting, that no one will ever see\n   * Try it, maybe it works for you, but be ready to abandon if necessary\n   * Only do it if  \n\n      * a) you have no other more valuable tasks to do and\n      * b) are totally well-rested, relaxed, and bored and need no rest time\n   * I would much rather spend an hour reading ahead, outlining, doing practice exams (late in the semester), doing career services tasks, taking care of personal errands, making flowcharts, revising my notes, reviewing my notes, etc. than I would an hour of briefing\n   * I would also much rather spend an hour sleeping, partying, watching Netflix, jogging, etc. than an hour briefing, because my energy will recharge and make be more productive at other more important tasks\n* MIDDLE GROUND: “Book Briefing”  \n\n   * Highlight important things\n   * Make notes in the margins\n   * Don’t actually write out a full brief\n   * Many people like this solution\n\n**Outlining**\n\n* Sounds scarier than it is  \n\n   * Literally just compile your notes into one big document, edit it a bit, and format so it’s easy to look stuff up/organize\n   * If you add something to the outline you don’t understand or remember, revisit your notes/book/friends/supplements/professor to figure it out  \n\n      * Eventually you’ll understand everything\n* Use old outlines!  \n\n   * Everyone agrees you shouldn’t just use an old outline straight up (and sometimes profs don’t allow it)\n   * But you don’t necessarily need to take the time to build one from scratch\n   * Either take an old one and modify it to your liking, or build your own but use the old ones as a reference to save time and make sure you don’t screw up\n   * Many schools have an outline bank\n   * Many student orgs have outline banks\n   * Your PAs should provide old outlines, as will student org mentors (ask them!)  \n\n      * Unless your school doesn't have PAs or mentors, of course\n* It’s an iterative process – the outline is never “done”  \n\n   * You want to compile the information in a way that is both comprehensive and easy to navigate in your brain  \n\n      * Remember that you’ll be flipping through or CTRL-Fing it urgently to look up something during an exam\n      * Information recall speed and organization are key\n* It’s also a critical learning experience as you fit all the conceptual pieces together in your head and organize them in ways your brain understands  \n\n   * This is the main reason relying solely on old outlines is a problem\n* Ideally you should add to your outlines bit by bit as the semester goes on  \n\n   * BUT note that you will not be capable of doing much of the connective intellectual work until the end of the semester when you’ve seen enough of the class to understand how things fit\n* An “attack outline” is literally just your outline, but slimmed down so it’s faster to look stuff up\n\n**Practice Exams**\n\n* Don’t worry about this until like, November\n* But once you get to the last few weeks, and certainly reading period and finals, these will be critically important\n* Most profs will give you old exams, though some wait until late in the semester  \n\n   * If not, ask\n   * If you can’t get them, try to find exams from other profs, or the internet\n   * DON’T ask a 2/3L for them, because schools tend to get very touchy about it and you don't want to get the 2/3L (or yourself) in trouble\n* You really really really need to get hands on practice applying your knowledge and resources to hypos\n* You WILL feel panicked the first time you’re staring at a hypo and a blank page but you’ll figure it out  \n\n   * You want to work through this experience on a practice, not the real thing\n   * Remember to read [this post about how to actually write the exam](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/e7m4uz/for_1ls_a_detailed_guide_on_how_the_hell_you/)\n\n**Think outside the box**\n\n* That’s basically it for traditional law school study techniques, but feel free to experiment\n* I personally started using Excel spreadsheets and found them ultra useful - [here's an example](https://www.reddit.com/user/Oldersupersplitter/comments/iiuucb/excel_cases_outline_example/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n   * Each case (including the minor note cases) gets a line with the name, year, the topic, a few words of facts, and a very brief overview of why it matters\n   * I can see the entire possible body of law for each topic on a single screen\n   * You start to notice trends and connections differently than in Word\n* Flowcharts  \n\n   * I love flowcharts, and as a 2L used flowcharts almost exclusively during the actual exams (with other traditional tools available if needed) - here is [a link with some examples](https://www.reddit.com/user/Oldersupersplitter/comments/idkyr8/flowchart_examples/)\n   * There are white boards in many library study rooms\n   * I eventually moved to the [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) website and find it easier to do electronically\n\n**Structuring your semester, revisited**\n\n* Now that we know what everything is….\n* Your #1 job is staying on top of the readings and class notes  \n\n   * Preferably staying slightly ahead on reading\n   * At the start, this is really your only goal\n* Review/revisit material periodically to refresh it and find connections  \n\n   * Some people do this at the end of each week, every couple weeks, etc\n* Talk to your classmates, talk to profs in office hours, try to learn wtf is going on\n* Look for old outlines day one, and refer to them as needed even before making your own\n* Start building your outlines and/or modifying old ones  \n\n   * Some people add a little each week, others only after 4-6 weeks, some at the end\n   * No correct answer, but certainly it’s good to at least start by November 1 if you can\n* In the second half of the semester, the focus shifts more and more from reading into outlining\n* In the final month, 90% of your time should be spent on outlining, practice exams, and filling in holes in your understanding  \n\n   * Those last two are more important than outlines, which is why it’s good to aim for progress on outlines early\n* [Plan out the days you’ll prepare for each final](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/dtiy6y/detailed_game_plan_for_finals_for_all_the_anxious/), way before you need to  \n\n   * I like to give myself 30 days before the first final: one week per class, then two days at the end to cram before the first final\n   * Then, as soon as you take a final, forget everything and spend all of your time prepping for the next one, and so on until you’re done\n   * Plan to be ultra burned out after each final  \n\n      * If you can study, great\n      * But you will almost certainly not have the mental or emotional capacity to  study until the next day, maybe that evening at best, so don’t rely on that time when you’re planning\n\n**Study groups**\n\n* Can be incredible helpful\n* Can also be a huge distraction\n* Very very important for reviewing practice exams at the very end\n* Probably worth trying them, at least with one other student to bounce things off of\n* Be extremely cautious about wasting time  \n\n   * Your classmates are probably cool and interesting, and if you become besties, you might spend all your time chatting and enjoying each other’s company instead of studying\n   * It’s good to have a concrete game plan for each study session - save the socializing for when you go to the bar *after* an efficient and productive study session (both the studying and the drinking will be improved this way)\n   * Later in the semester, you can even calendar specific things to cover on specific days\n* Don’t be afraid to include people from the other section(s) that share your professors!\n\n**Productivity in general**\n\n* There are many common suggestions and tips for productivity that I won’t write about for pages and pages here because you can look them online or in books (and by getting to this point, you’re probably respectably productive anyway)  \n\n   * However, here are some law school-specific thoughts that I have based on not only my own experience, but also the experiences of my 3L friends and the 1Ls I’ve mentored...\n* ***If you tell me you “studied 10 hours in the library….”***\n* First, law students love to exaggerate these things (so don’t freak out when your classmates mention stuff like this), but let’s assume you actually did 10 hours\n* Second, how much time during those 10 hours were you ACTUALLY studying?  \n\n   * Many many many people, myself included, will go to the library or their desk at home to “study” but find themselves constantly distracted by the obvious things (facebook, games, online shopping, news, etc) but also  less obvious things:  \n\n      * Talking to friends/study group about stuff that is not relevant to class\n      * Getting into deep philosophical arguments about legal theory that will make a great paper someday but have nothing to do with 1L exams\n      * Thinking about all the money you’ll make in BigLaw\n      * Thinking about how you’re going to save the world in PI\n      * Reading some interesting but irrelevant legal tangent because you don’t want to look at Torts any more that day\n      * Listening to friends in other sections talk about how *their* Contracts class is going\n      * Picking out the exact right shade of highlighter for highlighting today’s notes\n      * And so on…\n   * Sometimes you know that you’re not being productive if it’s Instagram, but many of these things I listed above might *feel like* you’re productive because they’re “about the law” or at least “law adjacent”  \n\n      * And hey, many of these things are great and valuable and you should do  them…. But don’t count them as “study time” in your schedule or your  head, because you will fool yourself into thinking you put in more hours  than you did\n      * Instead, use your study time to *actually study* and then spend the same amount of time doing all that other stuff I listed but block it out during a *separate time* in the day\n      * You may end up with MORE time to do these things that interest you because you power through the real studying all at once, and then feel free to go on tangents and socialize to your hearts content without being  chained to the library desk\n* Third, when you really truly are “studying,” what **specifically** does that mean and is it the most effective task at this moment?  \n\n   * This basically plays into everything I described about study habits above\n   * There  are lots of tasks that do technically count as studying, and hey maybe you do them for 4 straight hours without talking to anyone or checking  facebook…. But they don’t actually help you for the exam (or only help a  little bit)\n   * Here is where briefing really ruins a lot of people, in my opinion\n   * What are some other examples of tasks I’ve heard of classmates doing that waste time (or that I’ve done myself and realized my mistake)?  \n\n      * Re-reading the case multiple times after already discussing it in class (just revisit your notes at that point)\n      * Reading parts of the textbook that aren’t in the syllabus\n      * Reading supplements for topics that aren’t in the syllabus\n      * Memorizing facts (unless you get the rare closed book exam)\n      * Making flashcards (same thing)\n      * Looking up the history around an area of law, or the voluminous academic  scholarship around it (probably interesting, maybe valuable in the grand  sense for your education, but do it in “non-study” time because it has  no bearing on the exam unless the prof says it does or you’re very  confident it will come up)\n      * Briefing (in my opinion)\n* **IF** you only spend your study time doing **effective, high-value tasks** (*assigned*  reading, outlining, practice exams, reviewing notes, making visual aids  for the exam, finding explanations to topics you don’t understand,  filling in holes in your notes) and you also spend your “study time” **actually studying** without distraction  \n\n   * You will find that **the number of hours required to prepare thoroughly and get good grades is** **much smaller than you’d think**, and much smaller than the amount of time most students “study”\n   * This  is how some people “magically” get good grades while also going to Bar  Review, maintaining a relationship, playing video games, taking weekends  off, etc.  \n\n      * And, because they have left so many hours each day/week to rest and relax, their brains are in a better position to perform well when it comes to  study or take the exam!!\n* Of course, **I guarantee you will be nowhere near perfect** at this at the start, or even by the end of the first semester  \n\n   * But you should aspire toward efficiency and constantly ask yourself, *for you and the way YOU study effectively*, “am I actually studying during study time?” and “are my study tasks effective & efficient?”",

    "text": "biracial (chinese and mexican) and feeling disconnected from AAPI community in the U.S Hello, it's my first time posting something like this but ever since I've started college it seems like there is a cultural group or community out there for everyone except for me. I'm F20 and my mother is Chinese and my father is Mexican. Both are first generation immigrants who met in the states. Everyone I know who is east asian and mixed race usually has one white parent. I don't mean to sound like I am excluding people but I think it's a very different experience to be biracial and nonwhite. I have friends who are east asian and white and they have their struggles but in my area it is not an uncommon mix. \n\nMy physical appearance is very ethnically ambiguous (or so I've been told). I've been mistaken for many ethnicities in my life. I speak some Chinese (still can't read or write though) but I am fluent in Spanish and I am minoring in Spanish literature. I don't know if it's for these reasons that I have always felt like it is difficult to connect with other chinese people and chinese americans that aren't my immediate family. Maybe it's all in my head and I'm not actually being judged on how I look but I've attended mixers for east asian and chinese students at my university and have been mostly ignored. it could just be that i encountered some particularly cliquish people that one time and i'm willing to try again in the future. i always just get this feeling that i'm invading the safe space of people who grew up in similar ways and have similar life experiences. \n\nI feel very far removed from other people my age who are asian american and I don't know how to get in touch with that side of my identity. I engage in Chinese culture pretty regularly. I play mahjong, I can cook Chinese food, and I'm fond of many Chinese film directors. These are things I engage in with my family and I would like to connect more with my peers/broader community. Has anyone else experienced something like this? Are there any other nonwhite biracial people out there who feel the same way?",

I mean, I think generally I do but I got so triggered today. We're heading to Japan in a couple weeks and I know gratuity is not generally accepted.  There are exceptions though and I was asking about those exceptions on a visiting Japan FB group I'm in.\n\n95% of the comments were of disdain and admonishment.  I was accused of feeling superior to the Japanese, of wanting to change their culture, of not wanting to accept other cultures, of not giving a shit about anybody but myself and how so fucking American I am, which given the context, I translated that to how close-minded I am.\n\nWherever their anger is coming from, I'm not judging but it just got me thinking again about how being Asian and not really feeling like you belong anywhere, something I have struggled with my entire life but really it's been  years since I've even thought about. \n You get married, you have kids, your identity shifts to parenthood and raising children but their comments was a stark reminder: I'm too Asian in America and too American in Asia.  Last time I felt that way was in 1998 when I went on Taiwan Loveboat.\n\nI just needed to vent a little and didn't really have a place to do it.

They believed that the older person would receive more benefits at the expense of the younger person. Nonetheless, the participants rated the older man dating the younger woman more harshly than the older woman and younger man. Both however, were rated much more harshly compared to age similar couples. There were 99 participants ages 19 to 63 years old (mean age=29.49, SD=7.23) (62 men, 35 women, and 2 people who did not pick a gender) recruited from Amazon's MTurk.\n\n>As seen in Fig. 1, people expressed greater prejudice towards young men’s relationships when they partnered with older (M = 55.45, SD = 32.60), rather than younger women (M = 81.95, SD = 20.17), t(97) = −7.45, p < .001, d = .97.1 Similarly, people expressed greater prejudice towards older men’s relationships when they partnered with younger (M = 50.70, SD = 33.04), rather than older women (M = 80.08, SD = 22.45), t(97) = −8.34, p < .001, d = 1.04. Planned contrasts revealed that, in general, age-gap couples (M = 52.84, SD = 31.36) were liked significantly less than age-matched couples (M = 80.70, SD = 19.19), t(97) = −8.61, p < .001, d = 1.07.\n\nOlder men dating younger women were rated 50.7 (SD=33.04) but older women dating younger men were rated 55.45 (SD=32.6).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ac0s5osnk6ha1.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=29cbd9bfedb49f963d521be74be88f42b9562b4e\n\nThen participants rated how they perceived inequity in relationships based on age-gender dynamics. \"Participants inferred the extent to which each relationship was inequitable using a 7- point scale, ranging from 1 (He is getting a much better deal than she is) to 7 (She is getting a much better deal than he is). The midpoint of the scale was labeled 4 (They are both getting the same, equal deal).\" They found that the more a person perceived inequity in an age gap relationship, the more harshly they judged an age gap relationship, but the more they perceived inequity in an age-match relationship did *not* increase their negative perception of an age-match relationship. Still though they perceived more inequity with men dating younger women rather than older women dating younger men.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f6vwh0zbl6ha1.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&s=f72433805bb754afbd0c5d7e6509eb96fd4ce67d\n\nAnd age gap couples were judged much more harshly than mixed-socioeconomic status couples (i.e.: rich dates poor), mixed-weight (i.e.: fat person and thin person together) couples and interracial couples.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wj1pm5al6ha1.png?width=1087&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0ae404f49bee024d2ff399b8f3202a1c5ff014f\n\nSome older studies do show that women dating younger men is judged more harshly, but those were studies back in the day. It seems the double standard has switched. Men dating younger women is more taboo now, and cougars are more normalized now, probably due to the MILF porn category, which was set off by *American Pie*.",

    "text": "Many studies show black men face more discrimination than black women. Here is the evidence: Intersectional feminists often argue that black women have it the worst, and they suffer worse than black men because they're black and a woman. Well guess what? There's lots of evidence that shows black men face more discrimination than black women.\n\nThis [article](https://theconversation.com/black-men-face-high-discrimination-and-depression-even-as-their-education-and-incomes-rise-141027) by *The Conversation* elaborates on what black men deal with. According to study 1, black boys from the wealthiest families were the most depressed. Study 2 found that for black men, the highest education credentials were associated with an increase, not decrease, in depressive symptoms. Study 3 found that in a nationally representative sample of American adults, black men with the highest income had the highest risk of depression, specifically major depressive disorder. Interpersonal or one-on-one discrimination was not found to be a factor. Study 4 found that 700 black teenagers were followed for two decades in Flint, Michigan. Perceived racial discrimination was measured in 1999 and 2002. Discrimination as teens was a predictor of depressive symptoms in people transitioned to young adulthood a decade later. Nonetheless, this was only true for black men, but not black women. In that same study in Flint, an increase in perceived neighborhood fear, defined as being scared of the crime and violence in the neighborhood, was linked with an increase in depressive symptoms for black men, but not black women. Study 6 found on IAT tests that white men had higher racist attitudes towards black people than white women, but the difference wasn't particularly extreme, but statistically significant. Nonetheless, white women also can be really racist towards black people, too.\n\nBlack men also get arrested, incarcerated and stopped or profiled far more than black women. Even white men experience being arrested and incarcerated far more than black women. And the reason why most prisoners are men isn't simply because men commit crime more. [A significant minority of criminals are women](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/xyl5wb/statistics_cited_women_are_more_likely_to_commit/), but female criminals are severely underreported, get arrested less when reported, are less likely to be incarcerated when convicted, are paroled earlier, and given more lenient sentences compared to men. Additionally, black men are far more likely than anyone else to be killed by police. [In fact](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-06/race-and-police-shootings-what-new-research-says), white and Asian men were much more likely than even black or Native American women to be killed by police. Almost all police homicide victims were men! [Black men were also much more likely than anyone, even black women, to be murdered in general](https://www.niussp.org/health-and-mortality/americas-high-homicide-rate/?print=print). [Black men are also more likely than black women to be victims of crime in general](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/bvvc.pdf). [Black men also were](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/05/02/for-black-americans-experiences-of-racial-discrimination-vary-by-education-level-gender/) more likely to be subject to racial slurs/jokes, be unfairly stopped by a police officer, have people act suspicious towards them, been assumed to be prejudiced, or to have feared for their personal safety. In fact, 59% of black men had been unfairly stopped by police, compared to just 31% of black women.\n\nAnother study called \"[Gender Matters Too](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2008-05171-002)\" found black men and women in 11th grade classrooms differed in their perception of peer and classroom discrimination. For boys, discrimination harmed their grades, attitudes and their regard for the importance of school. For girls, however, the effects generally had a positive impact. Another [study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspa0000288) found that the real root of racism towards blacks was perceived threat, not dislike, and that people were racist toward black people not due to negativity towards them but feeling threatened by them, especially black men. When isolating negativity from threat, they found no automatic black-negativity link. Negativity towards blacks was associated with viewing them as a threat. [In fact](https://polisci.osu.edu/sites/polisci.osu.edu/files/mcconnaughy_white.pdf), another study found that people viewed black men as particularly violent, and viewed white men as more violent than black women. They ascribed a low amount of violent personalities to black women and an especially low amount of it to white women. They viewed black men as more promiscuous than white men, white men as more promiscuous than black women, white women slightly more promiscuous than black women! They viewed black men as less intelligent than black women, and viewed black men as less ambitious than black women. Fast responders gave unpleasant responses to black men far more than to black women. All responders gave black men the most unpleasant responses compared to black women and white men and women, and black women slightly less unpleasant responses compared to both white men and white women! Another [study](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.848.1523&rep=rep1&type=pdf) found that even both male and female participants were equally likely as each other to be more willing to shoot a black unarmed suspect than a white female armed suspect or black female armed suspect. Men and women equally were likely (when not even looking at race) to prefer shooting unarmed male suspects over armed female suspects. An implicit racial bias [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/0146167219829182) found that black women were seen as more dangerous than white women by participants of all races, but they still viewed black men as more dangerous than black women. Even when looking at black children, they viewed black boys as more dangerous than black girls.\n\n**Black men had it worse during slavery**\n\nThis thread I made a year ago talks about how there were more male than female black people enslaved in the United States, and the black women were more likely to be free. In 19th century United States, [more men than women were slaves and more women than men were freed slaves](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1010277/black-and-slave-population-us-by-gender/). Although there was always a difference, the difference increased in the Civil War because of all the black male soldiers who died, and women weren't sent off to war as soldiers.\n\nThis only looks at the ones in the US. Believe it or not, the vast majority of enslaved black people were sent to places like South America or the Caribbeans, and a minuscule percentage were in the US. [When looking at all the enslaved black people from the 17th to 19th century](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1183869/ratio-male-female-slaves-by-route-1636-1867/), they found that in any region, men outnumbered women, with the gap being quite large in most regions. Many historians think all slave owners were white men, but evidence found that 40% were white women. They were often cruel and violent just like male slave owners. In fact, George Washington's wife owned way more enslaved people than him. White women were trained to enslave black people from a very young age, and they even were often given slaves as early as 9 months old! [According to](https://www.history.com/news/white-women-slaveowners-they-were-her-property) History.com:\n\n>White women were active and violent participants in the slave market. They bought, sold, managed and sought the return of enslaved people, in whom they had a vested economic interest. Owning a large number of enslaved people made a woman a better marriage prospect. Once married, white women fought in courts to preserve their legal ownership over enslaved people (as opposed to their husband’s ownership), and often won. “For them, slavery was their freedom,” Jones-Rogers observes in her book.\n\n**Black men were raped, too.**\n\nWe often hear about female slaves being raped, and how it was legal to rape black women. [What we don't hear about is how often black men were raped by slave owners](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/448992/pdf). [They often were](https://shareok.org/handle/11244.46/1279). They also were stripped naked and white people laughed at their genitals (i.e.: body shaming of men for their penis size even though they have no control or choice of their penis size). According to the [AAIHS](https://www.aaihs.org/sexual-violence-against-enslaved-men/),\n\n>Foster begins *Rethinking Rufus* by examining how enslaved men’s bodies were depicted in Western art and sculptures that were widespread in the visual culture of slavery. Foster argues that enslaved men’s bodies were “symbols of enslaved manhood and sites of violation” that were objectified through a number of cultural forms including art and literature (12). The objectification of enslaved men depicted in paintings often resembled everyday acts of terror including the public inspection of Black men’s genitals, whippings and lashings, and bodily exposure due to lack of adequate clothing. Visual depictions of enslaved men that emphasized their genitalia and sexual prowess gave way to the prevailing myths of Black hypersexuality and the Black male rapist, an archetype that ensured the extralegal protection of white women from Black men who purportedly lacked control over their sexual urges. Foster also argues that while visual depictions of enslaved men’s bodies often highlighted their athleticism, strength, and muscularity, this same imagery eroticized enslaved men’s bodies in ways that fueled the physical abuses and sexual exploitation of enslaved men. Foster notes that these stereotypes found in eighteenth-century visual art contributed to the eventual punishment and national disenfranchisement of Black men.\n\n**White women also raped or sexually preyed on black men, too.**\n\n[White women also had sexually abused black men, too](http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1674/sexual-relations-between-elite-white-women-and-enslaved-men-in-the-antebellum-south-a-socio-historical-analysis). White women were authority figures or in a position of power over these black men, and white women had sex with black men, often even raping them forcibly. White women also threatened to falsely accuse black men of rape if black men didn't have sex with them. Because abortion was unregulated, and any woman was able to get an abortion back then, many white women used this advantage to sexually abuse black men without people knowing she fornicated out of wedlock, and was able to abortion \"illegitimate\" children, hiding the evidence that she sexually abused black men. As a result of this and the fact that men could not speak about being raped because people believe men cannot be raped, historical records of white women raping black men are often overlooked, and it could've been more common than we think, perhaps as common as white men raping enslaved black women.\n\n**Almost all lynching victims were men whereas a significant minority of victims were white.**\n\n[Another interesting fact](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5803482/lynching-nj-1901/): virtually all lynching victims were men. Of all the 2,516 lynchings that happened from 1885 to 1901 in the US, 82.67% happened in the South and 13.75% happened in the North. 66.69% were black and 31.84% were white. 97.97% were men and 2.03% were women. Just 51 women lynched compared to 2,465 men. We always hear about how most victims were black, but no information about how virtually all were men. White men got lynched far more than black women. Black women rarely were lynched, and almost no white women got lynched.\n\n**Black people also face discrimination when it comes to rape.**\n\nIt is true that people are less responsive to black women who got raped than white female rape victims, but if people knew how common it was for men to be raped, and women rape men as just as much as men rape women (cited in a thread I cited above about women being more likely to commit crime than people think), then I'm sure they'd respond less to black male rape victims than white male or black female rape victims. In fact, they'd probably care for black women who are raped than white men who raped. Black men also are viewed as hypersexual, promiscuous, unable to control sexual urges, and always wanting sexual intercourse.\n\nAlso, false accusations happen a lot more than feminists admit, and I cite evidence for it in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/xzb7d8/statistics_show_that_false_accusations_are_quite/) of mine, and black men especially are affected. Black prisoners incarcerated for rape are especially likely to be innocent, especially when their accuser is a white woman. White women historically falsely accused black men of rape to get them lynched, and they still falsely accuse them, and while most rapists get away with it, black men who are accused by white women are more likely to be incarcerated even if they're innocent. It was considered rape historically for black men to have consensual sexual intercourse with white women, and there was a double standard for a while where people judged black men marrying white women more harshly than white men marrying black women because black men were viewed as predatory.\n\n**Education/life expectancy**\n\nBlack women also have a higher life expectancy than white men and especially black men, and are less likely to go to college than white men but [go more than black men](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/black-women-are-earning-more-college-degrees-but-that-alone-wont-close-race-gaps/).\n\n**Feminists don't care about black people, not even black women.**\n\nFeminists often don't pay attention much to black women's struggles. Even first wave feminists disregarded them and didn't want them to vote, let alone allow black men to vote, and that motivated them and was a reason why they wanted to vote, because they worried black men were technically allowed to vote despite Jim Crow laws and didn't want them to have the complete ability to vote before white women.\n\nNonetheless, many stereotypes feminists make about men are especially applied to black men due to society historically portraying them as hypermasculine, hypersexual and prone to violence or crime. Feminists' portrayal of men harms black men especially. They also ignore false rape accusations despite that white women still, to this day, falsely accuse black men of rape which is why so many black prisoners are falsely incarcerated for rape, and yet feminists expect every reported person for rape to be imprisoned. They also widely ignore how black women are associated more with the term black than with women, and aren't viewed as normal women.\n\nThis is why womanism (black feminism) was started.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDoes anyone notice how people hate black men more than black women? Yeah black women face pregnancy discrimination with prenatal care and dealing with more abortions and unwanted pregnancies, but black men usually don't ever get to see their kids, and often cannot afford to pay child support. Many black children are raised by single moms and barely knew their dad, if at all.\n\nThe reason black men face more discrimination than black women is due to people's racism towards black people being associated with seeing them as a threat, not dislike, and being a woman prevents black women from being seen as a threat as much as black men. Nonetheless, people might see black women as more dangerous than white women and be racist towards them due to a guilt by association mindset. In spite of that, people still are more racist towards black men because when racial attitudes are mostly about feeling threatened, people tend to view women in general as harmless, which is different from how they view men in general.",

This was written by a female university professor.\n\nWhen I hear people say \"oh, you're just an inkwell dude,\" I have to ask: is she an inkwell as well? Are you gonna call her one too?\n\nThe article reads:\n\n\"Minneapolis studies of physical attractiveness show that people do, in fact, judge a book by its cover, often with dramatic effects on those being judged. The findings suggest that expectations based on physical attractiveness can become self-fulfilling prophecies that may strongly influence the course of a person's life.\"\n\nPrecisely. You might even say \"[determine](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063975) the course of a person's life.\"\n\nMost people are usually only concerned about how they're perceived by the opposite sex, but your [looks dictate other aspects of your life as well](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4757567/).\n\nWhen you say this out loud, [people don't like it](https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=7290948) because it goes against their core belief that [people are in charge of their futures](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/).\n\nBut looks indeed do strongly influence the course of a person's life.

'It's simply not so. The most important factors governing success in life are genetically determined: appearance, intelligence, sex and height.' She cited a continuing study at the University of Minnesota of identical twins who had been reared apart. The study, she says, is showing that 'genetically identical children turn out to be very similar even though they grow up in very different environments.'\"\n\nShe almost nailed it. The idea of genetic determinism is indeed anathema to most people on earth, not only Americans. It's an uncomfortable idea. It challenges the validity of a lot of moral values and beliefs in society that comtemporary laws stand up on: [free will](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/), [justice](https://www.ushistory.org/documents/pledge.htm#), [the belief that we're in charge of our lives and decisions](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-american-philosophical-association/article/abs/kants-demonstration-of-free-will-or-how-to-do-things-with-concepts/31C9C11F6C0414B9C817A0580A416A05), [the idea that we are responsible for our fates](https://www.edcor.com/newsletter/jack-welch-on-pursuing-your-passion/), [the notion of objective right and wrong](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-american-philosophical-association/article/abs/kants-demonstration-of-free-will-or-how-to-do-things-with-concepts/31C9C11F6C0414B9C817A0580A416A05), etc.\n\nThe idea of genetic determinism brings a lot of these ideas into question.\n\n[The most important factor is indeed looks](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/03/health/ugly-children-may-get-parental-short-shrift.html), first and foremost, which is genetics.\n\nThen, I'd say opportunities and environment, rather than sheer intelligence, are the next most important. I slightly disagree with her here. [Which country you were born in](https://data.who.int/countries/426), [your race](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/36347), [which family you were born into](https://bloustein.rutgers.edu/research-generational-wealth), all of which are determined by luck.\n\nNext in order, according to Berschied, is a person's sex. That is true, but it's the other way around. [It's girls who have a head start over boys](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191491X17302584).\n\nThen again, she was born in 1936, and she grew up in the 1940s and 1950s when [women didn't have de facto equality](https://apnews.com/article/50fb651b7fb84221887f8a7534a87fff), so I'm gonna give her a pass here.\n\n\"The preferential treatment of physically attractive people starts right after birth, Dr. Berscheid noted, and continues throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood. These are among the more telling research findings, all of which involved normal-looking people of varying degrees of attractiveness:\"\n\nKeep in mind that scientifically more airtight studies that came out in the last 40 years [not only confirm the aforementioned evidence](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30766-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982218307668%3Fshowall%3Dtrue), but also show that looks are [even more important than previously thought](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092656621000131).\n\n[The rabbit hole goes even deeper](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S016363839890011X). A baby born yesterday knows it's over for you.\n\nThis is beyond brutal, man.\n\n\"As women become more independent socially and economically, Dr. Berscheid sees them placing a greater emphasis on the attractiveness of men, 'who are now in the \"meat market\" just like women have always been.' She cited the recent advent of male centerfolds and male nude dancers as examples of women's interests in how men look.\n\nAnother factor has been the importance women today place on love as a criterion for choosing a mate. In 1967 only 24 percent of women questioned said they would marry only if they were in love, but a decade later, 80 percent said 'being in love' was a necessary condition for marriage.\"\n\nShe really saw it coming considering that she was born in 1936 and grew up in the 1950s. But even she likely underestimated the [effects of looks](https://home.uchicago.edu/~hortacsu/onlinedating.pdf), [the invention of dating apps](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.2087), and [more](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2012/02/SDT-Intermarriage-II.pdf) in the new millennium.\n\n\"'When romantic love becomes an important factor in social choice, physical attractiveness becomes important also,' Dr. Berscheid told a symposium on the psychological aspects of facial form last year. The symposium brought together plastic surgeons, dentists and others who produce facial changes that often affect patients more powerfully than the functional defects they correct.\n\nSometimes patients react badly -'with pain and bewilderment' - to significant improvements in their appearance, Dr. Berscheid told the meeting at the University of Michigan. This reaction could result from the realization that **we are not just loved for ourselves but for what we look like**, she suggested.\"\n\nThis is a tough pill to swallow for a lot of people.\n\n\"Dr. Berscheid believes there is a hazard inherent in denying the impact of physical attractiveness: 'Unattractive children who are unpopular may wrongly attribute their lack of popularity to some flaw in their character or personality,' she says. Such an error, she believes, could result in lasting and painful scars.\"\n\n[Again, she nails it](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.7.1373). It happens all the time.

Would this person think it more likely than not that the judge, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly?” The Court added that “[w]hether there is a reasonable apprehension of bias is to be assessed from the point of view of a reasonable, fair minded and informed person.” Id.

    "text": "When men have casual sex a lot, or even desire casual sex, people see him as a womanizer who objectifies women, not a stud. In fact, most things men do that get called \"objectification\" is just him desiring casual sex. Feminists always like to complain that people glorify a man who has sex with a huge number of people as a stud, but in reality, this is mostly a myth. Empirical evidence has found mixed results about whether this double standard about promiscuity and casual sex exists, and the general consensus is: some men hold a double standard, but many men hold a single standard and judge both promiscuous men and women. Not many women like promiscuous men, and they often judge them and promiscuous women, but some hold a reverse double standard. All of the statistics can be found in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/yknuw7/the_myth_that_society_restricted_womens_sexuality/) of mine. Here are some key points the thread makes:\n\n* Women were just as strict, if not slightly stricter than men about how many partners is too many. In fact, it was not uncommon for men to give a promiscuous woman a chance for short-term relationships.\n* Even when using IATs and other methods to control for social desirability bias, they found that people didn't generally hold a double standard and were gender-neutral about their views of promiscuity. If anything, it was more common for women to hold a reverse double standard than for men to hold the pro-male double standard.\n* People don't care if a woman has premarital sex, contrary to what feminists think, and people actually view premarital sex as normal for everyone. In fact, nowadays, virgin women often are seen as prudes rather than pure, but virgin men are more stigmatized. In the late 20th century, after the sexual revolution appeared due to the invention of the pill, people didn't care if people had premarital sex as long as it was in a relationship. Casual sex was stigmatized though. According to new Pew Research surveys, most Americans now think casual sex is acceptable, especially Americans under 50 and even many Americans over 50. Sometimes casual sex in particular might be stigmatized, but now, most people moved on.\n* Men usually don't value virginity anymore, and many men and women both call it a dealbreaker. In fact, men who only want virgins are rare, even for those who merely value it.\n* Back just 10 years ago (2013), when men and women were asked about sex. They didn't view premarital sex in a relationship as bad at all. Men had neutral to somewhat positive views on a man who had sex with someone they weren't in a relationship with and neutral to somewhat negative views on a woman who did, whereas women had neutral to somewhat negative views on both men and women who did such a thing. In the late 2010s though, surveys show a much more positive acceptance of casual sex. Nowadays, hooking up frequently in particular appears to be what is frowned upon, but many people are defending that nowadays, especially socially liberal people.\n* People never cared historically if a woman had non-reproductive sex or enjoyed it, as long as it was with her spouse. Men are allowed to have sex before marriage, but it could only be with hookers. A man who had sex with a non-hooker was viewed as evil or predatory, and was called a rake. Although women today view promiscuous men as unattractive, women back long ago in the 1800s used to say \"reformed rakes make the best husbands\". They viewed promiscuous men as desirable for a marital partner as long as he gave up his promiscuity for commitment because they considered them manly, but people warned women about these men and told them that virgin husbands were preferable and that rakes would abuse, cheat or have STDs. People viewed them as objectifying even back then.\n* It's usually just hypermasculine men who view promiscuous men as a stud. Even historically, if a man had sex with an unmarried woman, only some of his male peers would give him a pat on the back, not people in general.\n\nSo as you can see, men generally hold a single standard, and only some, particularly hypermasculine men, will hold a double standard. Although women often hold a single standard, some hold a reverse double standard. It's more nuanced than people think.\n\nAnd people historically called these men rakes or philanderers. Now, they're called womanizers. It was suggested that these men were predatory and viewed women as objects, and women who had casual sex back in the day were called a slut because it means she's dirty or will be impregnated with a bastard child who doesn't belong to the man she marries. **Nowadays, although people have become accepting of casual sex, people, especially feminists, still call a man \"objectifying\" just for merely desiring casual sex with a woman or thinking she's hot**.\n\nPeople historically expected women to wait until marriage. In the past few decades ago, they expected her to be having premarital sex, but generally in relationships. Now, they think her hooking up is normal, as long as she doesn't engage in promiscuity. Historically, men were expected to only have sex with hookers, then when prostitution got banned entirely, they were expected to wait until marriage (but his male peers may have expected him to try \"scoring\" with women). Then after the sexual revolution, him having premarital sex in relationship was normal, and now even him hooking up is normal, but promiscuity is still taboo.\n\nNonetheless, when he desires casual sex with women, some women, especially when they have a reverse double standard, call him \"objectifying\". People criticize a woman who writes overly sexual lyrics, but men who write lyrics like that are called \"misogynistic\", especially rappers and even rock bands who wrote songs about it just for writing songs about sex. Just look at this \"objectification scale\":\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29qhlaz6dnpb1.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=d16908bf04b20c59a5e684a93b3d24f88d4bca8d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n68ipno7dnpb1.png?width=434&format=png&auto=webp&s=70e8601fa7ff7c91aaa5fbb43394f4b86e0647f7\n\nApparently enjoying porn is objectifying, and even appreciating a woman's body or even just imagining what it's like to see a woman you know naked or have sex with her is objectifying. Meanwhile, a woman who does this and appreciates a man's shirtless body or thinking about having sex with him is seen as normal. Real objectification would be viewing someone as an actual object, where you don't have to rely on their consent, can do whatever you'd like with them and where their feelings don't matter, but just because you think a woman's body looks nice or imagine sex with them doesn't mean you devalue consent, her emotions and would sexually harass her. So why do we not accuse women of doing these same things of being objectifying? Because men are expected to be flattered if a woman does a such a thing, and people think women cannot be predatory or malicious. She can't be considered a rake or a manizer. This is because men were the initiators of sex and women were the gatekeepers. Apparently a thought crime is now objectifying.\n\nSo why do men \"objectify\" women more than vice versa? [It's because men, regardless of sexual orientation and how egalitarian their country is, desire casual sex more than women do](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sexual-personalities/201706/what-type-of-person-would-agree-to-have-sex-with-a-stranger). [Even gay men \"objectify\" men](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0265407519832669). Women might \"objectify\" men too when she's ovulating and when she meets a masculine, muscular, chiseled, heavily tattooed hunk. \n\n**So it is time to stop acting like society has never demonized men for enjoying casual sex, because people obviously see him as objectifying and while actual objectification exists, 90% of what is called objectification is just a man appreciating a woman's appearance and wanting to hook up, even though people value looks all the time with casual sex. We don't accuse women of objectifying men when they do the same thing because we don't view women as predatory or act protective of men. It's sexist to act super protective of women to the point where a man simply thinking her body is hot and wanting to hook up with her is \"objectifying\".**",

The death penalty may not be imposed if the defendant is merely a minor participant and did not actually kill or intend to kill. However, the death penalty may be imposed if the defendant is a major participant in the underlying felony and exhibits extreme indifference to human life.[20]\n\n> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_murder_rule#United_States\n\nPlease note there is no statue of limitations on the crime of felony murder.\n\nA social worker worker who may have knowingly or negligently manufactured a false child custody recommendation may be abusing that child.

A dad wrote about a biased mediator who is not actually attempting to mediate a dispute but rather is silencing dad and attempting to force dad to agree to an arrangement which he feels is not fair to him and his child.\n\nHere is my response in the hopes that it helps other parents and their children to better advocate for faithful mediation, and that it may protect children from child abuse to which they are at greater risk when they don't have a relationship with both loving parents.\n\nI'm not an attorney and this is not legal advice.\n\nYou wrote about a biased mediator who is not actually attempting to mediate a dispute but rather is silencing you and attempting to force you to agree to an arrangement which you feel is not fair to you and your child.\n\nPlease consider:\n\n> What Is a Court Ordered Mediation?\n\n> In legal terms, ‘mediation’ is a type of alternative dispute resolution that can help resolve conflicts and avoid litigation. Parties to a lawsuit or domestic matter (such as a divorce or a child custody case) can choose to go to mediation to work out an agreement. In some cases, however, a court may direct the litigants to attend one or more sessions with an approved mediator. This is called court-ordered mediation.\n\n> Is Court-Ordered Mediation Mandatory and Binding?\n\n> If a judge orders the parties to a lawsuit to attend mediation, they must obey and attempt the process in ‘good faith.’ As with any other judicial order, a party that fails to comply with a court order directing mediation can be held in ‘contempt of court.’ Penalties for contempt can include fines and jail time.\n\n> The Law Dictionary\n\n> https://thelawdictionary.org/article/court-ordered-mediation/\n\nAnd:\n\n> Nature of the Process\n\n> Mediation is a process wherein the parties meet with a mutually selected impartial and neutral person who assists them in the negotiation of their differences.\n\n> Role of the Mediator: What does a Mediator do?\n\n> Mediation leaves the decision power totally and strictly with the parties. The mediator does not decide what is \"fair\" or \"right,\" does not assess blame nor render an opinion on the merits or chances of success if the case were litigated. Rather, the mediator acts as a catalyst between opposing interests attempting to bring them together by defining issues and eliminating obstacles to communication, while moderating and guiding the process to avoid confrontation and ill will. The mediator will, however, seek concessions from each side during the mediation process.\n\n> https://www.jamsadr.com/mediation-defined/\n\nI would gather as much evidence as possible. I would explain my view that neither the mediator nor the other person are acting in good faith. \n\nI would consider communicating all of my concerns in writing. I might ask the court to replace this mediator with a different mediator whose actions I would believe are more consistent with their legal duties.\n\nThe mediator's actions may be:\n\nPossible honest services fraud:\n\n> For the purposes of this chapter, the term “scheme or artifice to defraud” includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\n\n> 18 U.S. Code § 1346.Definition of “scheme or artifice to defraud”\n\n> https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1346\n\n> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honest_services_fraud\n\nMom and the mediator may be secretly working together against you and your child, and deceptively mispresenting the situation as legitimate mediation to the courts. This is:\n\nPossible criminal conspiracy against rights:\n\n> \"If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the same; or\"\n\n> 18 U.S. Code §241.Conspiracy against rights\n\n> https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/241\n\nI would consider filing a subpoena so that I can understand any or all of the ex-parte communications between the mediator and the other person.\n\nThe mediator's alleged attempts to force you to accept an agreement may not be in your child's interests. Also their attempts to prevent you from discussing relevant issues could be construed by you as attempt to create a false report to the court and in so doing, achieve a corrupt goal. Forcing you to go along under those conditions may be:\n\n> Extortion\n\n> Forcing action or obtaining something by illegal means.  Anyone may commit extortion through force or coercion.

This may present in romantic relationships as threats, insults, constant monitoring, excessive jealousy, manipulation, humiliation, intimidation, and dismissiveness, among others. Sometimes emotional abuse is more obvious, like a partner yelling at you or calling you names. Other times it can be more subtle, like your partner acting jealous of your friends or not wanting you to hang out with someone of another gender. While these emotionally abusive behaviors do not leave physical marks, they do hurt, disempower, and traumatize the partner who is experiencing the abuse.\n\n> https://www.thehotline.org/resources/what-is-emotional-abuse/\n\nSounds like:\n\n> What Is Domestic Violence?\n\n> Does your partner ever….\n\n> Insult, demean or embarrass you with put-downs?\n\n> Stop you from seeing your friends or family members?\n\n> Make all of the decisions without your input or consideration of your needs?\n\n> Tell you that you’re a bad parent or threaten to take away your children?\n\n> https://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/\n\nAll victims have equal access:\n\n> \"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of actual or perceived  ...sex..be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination underany program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available under [VAWA]\"\n\n> https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ovw/legacy/2014/06/20/faqs-ngc-vawa.pdf\n\nSee also:\n\n> Improving Law Enforcement Response to Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence by Identifying and Preventing Gender Bias\n\n> https://www.justice.gov/ovw/policing-guidance\n\nUsing a child as a weapon of domestic violence is also child abuse:\n\nMinimum standards for child abuse:\n\n> Federal law definitions of child abuse and neglect\n\n> Federal legislation provides guidance to States by identifying a minimum set of acts or behaviors that define child abuse and neglect. The Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) (42 U.S.C.A. § 5106g), as amended by the CAPTA Reauthorization Act of 2010, defines child abuse and neglect as, at minimum:\n\n> \"Any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker, which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation\"; or\n\n> \"An act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm.\"\n\n> https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/can/defining/\n\n> https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/5106g\n\nI would consider an emergency motion to change custody to prevent the abusive parent from having unsupervised access to the child or to at least ensure I would have enforceable parenting time in specific terms.
