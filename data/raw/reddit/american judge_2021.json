    "text": "What boomers and older folks are failing to recognize about wages, the state our economy, and the struggle of younger generations. The following was pulled from answer on Quora by Eris Ke Ku’e. Let me know what you think. Why don’t people want the American Dream anymore - marriage, kids, a dog, and the white picket fence?\nI feel like my husband and I are part of the last American generation to be able to achieve this “American Dream\". We are late Generation Xers. How were we able to make this happen?\n\nMy husband grew up upper middle class. I grew up lower class. He was able to attend college because his parents had the savings to pay for his tuition, room, and board. I was able to attend college mainly on the back of hearty Pell Grants, with a few academic scholarships. We both attended the same well-respected state university and at the time, tuition was a mere $1,500 a semester in state. Our books were about $700 a semester. Room, board and meal plans were crazy affordable.\n\nWe walked out of college completely debt free, him thanks to his parents, me thanks to very affordable tuition, government subsidy, and some work on my part for academic scholarships. We got married Junior year in college. Our apartment was dirt cheap ($400) and I was able to pay for it, along with food, entirely on the back of a part time job. And in 2000, I was a pharmacy tech making $11 an hour. We used public transport and I got dirt cheap birth control from Planned Parenthood. We had cheap student health insurance. We were good.\n\nI graduated with a BSN in nursing and he became a teacher. Neither pay royally, but because we were married, our combined income was adequate to support us. We married young and being a dual income house paved the way for us. We had our first baby, planned, a couple years later, while in a fairly nice apartment, 2 bedrooms, very nice area, for $650 a month in a larger city on the East coast. Simply put, housing was affordable.\n\nNext, we were able to buy a house before the market crash. We moved to a bigger city south of us, and we picked an up and coming area where prices were fractional to established areas. In May of 2005, we picked a lovely 1,800 square foot, 3 bedroom, 2.5 bath house with a loft and a two car garage with a killer master suit on half an acre of wooded land for the absolutely bargain price of $140,000. Did I mention it was a new build with a warrantee? I mean, it was a buyer's market all the way.\n\nAs for financing. Interest rates were incredible. They were handing out loans like candy. We got an 80/20 loan at 0% down at a 4% interest rate on the main and a 4.5% interest rate on the 20%. The first mortgage was a 30 year and the second mortgage was a 15 year. Our total house payment, after taxes and insurance, was around $1,000. Retrospectively, the loan process was a ridiculous breeze. We obviously did not get stuck with a subprime loan and we didn’t buy a house that was overpriced. We were certainly lucky, not so much wise. These loans with those rates simply do not exist anymore.\n\nThen the market crashed. We had another child and we soon decided that we wanted to get rid of our second mortgage and get a 15 year fixed loan. However, the game had changed. We eventually succeeded, but the sheer difficulty of this process post crash was insane. Even though we were not a risk, the mortgage company needed years of financial statements, years of tax returns, so many paystubs, freaking statements from our employers that we were not at risk of being terminated, even multiple property appraisals. You can see how if someone is just starting out and trying to buy a home, they very well might not have years and years of solid employment and financials. I could see where the industry was coming from, but if a very stable, middle class couple was struggling with a refinance, what on earth would a single person, or a person of less money or weaker employment do?\n\nAnd to put things in perspective, even though I was a pharmacy tech almost 20 years ago in college, current pharmacy techs aren't even making $11 an hour! Two decades later! Their pay is seemingly going backwards. All while the tuition for the university I attended has over quadrupled for in state tuition! If I were in the exact same boat today, I absolutely would not have become a middle class homeowner. Government subsidies for education have dropped, the interest rates for loans are up, you cannot claim your interest on taxes anymore, and tuition is absolutely through the roof.\n\nIf I were in school now, there would be zero way I would be able to walk away with a college degree and no debt. No way could I only have worked part time to pay for housing. No way would I find an apartment that affordable. The same apartment I lived in 15 years ago is now $1,100 a month. And guess what? Wages have not risen enough to offset that cost. And Lord knows what I would have done for birth control because that particular Planned Prenthood had to close its doors.\n\nI'm no economist, historian, or sociologist. I only know my experience. And looking at the cost of things overall today, mixed with the poor growth in wages, I'd be screwed as a millennial today. To put it into perspective, in 10 years, the price of our first house has gone up a full $100,000. The area developed, but it certainly didn’t turn into anything terribly different from when we lived there.\n\nThat being said, as a nurse, in the ten years since we bought that house, my wages have gone up exactly $3/hr. My husband has not gotten a raise in 7 years. That's right. Seven years and not even a 1% bump. But his insurance has gone up and his benefits have decreased, as have mine. At the price it is now, we would not be buying that house with our current incomes in this current economy. Due to the rise of insurance, we are both taking home less money than we were 7 years ago. That certainly feels counter intuitive.\n\nSo, yeah. The masses aren't reaching for the American Dream anymore because everybody knows the American Dream is much harder to reach than it was 15 years ago. People have had to compromise. Maybe you can afford education but not a house. Maybe you aren't lucky to afford even an education. Maybe you're in a field where wages are frozen. Maybe you aren't married and you don’t have the perk of a dual income. Maybe, maybe, maybe, there are a thousand maybes.\n\nAnd all of this isn’t even considering the fact that perhaps this new generation has different goals. Maybe they would rather travel than own property frozen in one place. Maybe they want to be at the top of their field rather than at home raising kids. Maybe they just want to be able to eat and have a roof over their head, because in this economy, that truly is considered a success.\n\nSo I say, we kind of ruined the fact that the American Dream used to really be the American Reality. Now, younger generations have a different reality to face, and we should not be judging them on making choices that make more sense in this new reality that they face. They are having to make new dreams, because the old dream is rapidly dying.",

    "text": "In light of the death of Todd Akin, a Republican member of the Missouri House Representatives, who coined the term \"legitimate rape,\" I wanted to highlight some of his colleagues' comments over the years in helping perpetuate the patriarchal rape culture. In 2012, while running for the US Senate, former Missouri House Representative Todd Akin stated, [\"If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.”](https://www.politico.com/story/2012/08/akin-legitimate-rape-victims-dont-get-pregnant-079864)  As someone who [worked for IBM selling computers and ran the maintenance department at his father's steel company](https://news.stlpublicradio.org/government-politics-issues/2012-10-02/akin-embraces-image-of-minuteman-as-he-battles-establishment-including-his-own-party), it clearly gave him the expertise necessary in women's anatomy, biology, and physiology to be able to make this assertion.  Of course, as an anti-choice usurper of rights, what type of man would he be, unless he [physically restricted access to reproductive healthcare clinics for women in need](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/todd-akin-was-arrested-multiple-times-for-physically-blocking-womens-access-to-abortion-clinics-7dda2f38d322/)?\n\nAkin's son, Perry, said, [\"As my father’s death approached, we had people from all different walks of life share story after story of the personal impact he had on them.\"](https://apnews.com/article/former-rep-todd-akin-dead-0a1b944f96eee4b63d9ea57e04c44ca4)  Of this, I have no doubt.  I'm certain that there are millions of women across the globe who would have liked to share the impact your father's life had, and will continue to have, on them.\n\nIn 1990, Lawrence Lockman, a Republican member of the Maine House of Representatives wrote, while serving as director of the Pro-Life Education Association, [\"If a woman has (the right to abortion), why shouldn't a man be free to use his superior strength to force himself on a woman?  At least the rapist's pursuit of sexual freedom doesn't (in most cases) result in anyone's death.\"](https://archive.vn/5cKpD)  Well, in that case, since you make such a perfectly reasonable, rational argument...\n\nIn 1990, Texas Republican gubernatorial nominee Clayton Williams, lamenting poor weather conditions that threatened to cancel a cattle roundup at his West Texas ranch, likened the atmospheric conditions to rape, stating, [“Rape is kinda like the weather. If it’s inevitable, relax and enjoy it.”](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/personal-foul/)\n\nIn 2018, former US Rep for Iowa, Republican Steve King was asked about his stance of not allowing exceptions for either rape or incest in anti-choice legislation.  He said, [\"What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that?\"](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/14/steve-king-abortion-rape-incest-westside-conservative-iowa-representative-birth-iowa-civilization/2007230001/)  Steve King, everyone; noted critical thinker, [construction worker](http://kingconstruction.net/), and [avowed](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/413601-steve-king-members-of-nazi-linked-party-in-austria-would-be-republicans-if) and [unabashed neo-Nazi](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/13/17459908/steve-king-neo-nazi-tweet-retweet).\n\nFormer Republican Senator from Pennsylvania, Rick Santorum, most recently in the news for attempting to erase all remnants of Native Americans from North American soil ([\"We birthed a nation from nothing. I mean, there was nothing here. I mean, yes we have Native Americans but candidly there isn't much Native American culture in American culture\"](https://twitter.com/JasonSCampbell/status/1386685340522536961)), when asked what his views were on abortion in cases of rape and incest in 2012, stated, [\"...the right approach is to accept this horribly created--in the sense of rape--but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way, the gift of human life, and accept what God has given to you...We have horrible things happen.  I can't think of anything more horrible.  But, nevertheless, we have to make the best out of a bad situation.\"](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/santorum-to-rape-victims-make-the-best-out-of-a-bad-situation-a8388910c907/)  Apparently, in the case of rape, it's a gift.  It's a horribly created gift, yet nonetheless, a gift.  However, in the case of incest, it's what?  Just a regular, everyday gift?  A normal byproduct of a fully-functional family life?\n\nAlso in 2012, Richard Mourdock, a Republican candidate at the time running for Senate in Indiana, stated, [\"...I came to realize life is that gift from God.  And I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.\"](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/richard-mourdock-even-pregnancy-from-rape-something-god-intended/)\n\nIn 2014, Montana Judge Todd Baugh sentenced a 54-year-old, admitted child molester, convicted of repeatedly raping his 14-year-old female student, who committed suicide during the course of the trial, to 30 days in jail.  At sentencing, he stated that the victim [\"seemed older than her chronological age\" and was \"as much in control of the situation\"](https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/29/protesters-demand-montana-judge-resign-over-rape-sentencing/) as her rapist.  One month later, in an interview, he defended his decision, stating, \"Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent.  I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape.  It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.\"  [He also added that her death complicated the case](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/28/teacher-rape-montana/2722817/).\n\nIn 2019, a Tennessee Judge Steven Sword sentenced former pastor, David Richards, to 12 years in prison, 60 short of the maximum prosecutors had sought, for repeatedly having raped his adopted daughter over the course of two years, beginning when she was 14-years-old.  Richards maintained his innocence throughout trial, attempting to portray his victim as a rebellious teenager, who only made the allegations, after he had imposed strict rules for his children.  However, his DNA profile was lifted from a seminal fluid sample recovered from the girl's bed frame.\n\n[The judge, in handing down his lenient sentence, stated that he took into account Richard's longtime ministry, the Bible study he began in jail while awaiting trial, and the community support he received from family, friends, and fellow Christians](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/crime/2019/05/09/former-pastor-nets-12-year-prison-term-rape-adopted-daughter-david-lynn-richards/1143006001/).\n\nAt sentencing, over 30 friends and parishioners sat on Richard's side of the courtroom in support of him, while only six appeared for his victim.  One of those appearing on behalf of Richards to argue for sentencing leniency, David Thompson, who shared ministerial duties w/ Richards at their church, said, [\"I find it impossible for me to believe he's guilty of this. His business needs him. His family needs him. Our church needs him.\"](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/crime/2019/05/09/former-pastor-nets-12-year-prison-term-rape-adopted-daughter-david-lynn-richards/1143006001/)  Clearly, his family needs him, since he's such a wonderful father.\n\nAnd, of course, there's the new breed of vitriolic misogynists who, in a single breath, deny rape culture while proliferating it w/ their toxic ideology.  They refer to themselves as \"[Western chauvinists](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys),\" but in reality, [they're nothing but neo-Nazi terrorists](https://www.timesofisrael.com/not-nazi-enough-proud-boys-leader-wants-group-to-fully-embrace-white-supremacy/), and [that's all they've ever been](https://www.adl.org/blog/proud-boys-bigotry-is-on-full-display), so don't be fooled by their rhetoric.  They've now taken to wearing suits and ties and [holding yearly conventions that promise to make \"men masculine again,\" while \"Making Women Great Again.\"](https://the21convention.org/)  Since last year's conference was such disgrace, [this year's conference promises to be an even more hatefully misogynistic experience w/ 17 featured speakers, and in a first, they're actually going to allow to women to speak](https://22convention.com/)!\n\n>Women today are being taught to act more like men. Where has that led us? Skyrocketing rates of broken families, a documented decline in female happiness since the 1970s, endless social and dating dysfunction, and America at the #1 spot in the world for single motherhood. No longer will you have to give in to toxic bullying feminist dogma and go against your ancient, biological nature as a woman, great men and women have arrived to help #MWGA.\n\nIt's pretty clear that this toxicity has led to a rape culture that's just intolerable, and this is just a snapshot of what's taking place in America.  [Gender-based violence has rooted itself in some of the most populous countries in the world, and the problem only appears to be getting worse](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/southasiasource/understanding-rape-culture-in-bangladesh-india-pakistan/).  In other parts of the world, the abuse of women is absolutely horrific, [akin to something the Third Reich did to Jews in the death camps](https://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1233&context=history-in-the-making).  In 2016, an [Indian woman from the state of Rajasthan was gangraped by her husband and his two brothers](https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india-woman-gangraped-by-husband-in-laws-tattooed-with-expletives-over-dowry-336883), then tattooed across her forehead and hands/arms w/ expletives, b/c her family failed to meet the husband's dowry demands.  In 2018, [a 17-year-old Moroccan girl was abducted, tortured, and gangraped by 13 men over the course of two months](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/8/27/morocco-outcry-after-girl-is-raped-tattooed-with-swastikas).  They burned her w/ cigarettes and tattooed her all over her body, including w/ symbols of swastikas.\n\nThis could go on (and on and on and on and on), but there's only so much space available on the Internet.  What's clear is that those who perpetuate this violent culture are the same who propose and legislate the wholly ineffectual laws designed to deal w/ this problem, and they're also those who enforce, prosecute, and adjudicate said laws.  In a sense, it's allowing predators to sit in judgment of predators, while, at the same time, giving them the option to dismiss those they victimize.  I'd say that it's a broken system, except that it's not.  It's a system that's working exactly in the way in which it was intended.",

So I am a lawyer who has been in practice for around a decade and am a partner at a law firm in the northeastern US. Things are going pretty well, I definitely feel I get some disparate treatment from judges who are part of an \"old boys' club\" and there have been many times in my career where I have had to explain that I'm not a paralegal or secretary, but as I have aged and learned to dress differently, this issue has been decreasing in frequency. \n\nSo one of my \\[male\\] partners and I had to go to a business lunch with a \\[male\\] salesperson/potential vendor. It was a nice meal at a steakhouse where the salesperson was explaining how he thought he could benefit our business with his services. It was a normal schmoozy business lunch. As background, everyone at the lunch was American and a married person with children. It was when we all said goodbye at the end when things got weird. \n\nWe stood up to leave and thanked the guy for the lunch and my male partner shook hands with the salesperson. I was standing next to them and also extended my hand in a handshake position and THE SALESPERSON TOOK MY HAND AND KISSED IT. With his MOUTH. In the year 2021. In a PANDEMIC. And nobody seemed to think that this was insane. Everyone just continued with life as normal. I felt like I was in the twilight zone. How is it possible that you can get to this point in your career and human history and still experience unwanted kissing on your body at work functions? Is this somehow normal? What does one even do in a situation like that?\n\nThank you for listening.",

    "text": "What to teach young girls before puberty, based on things that I was not taught growing up I (17) have been contemplating this post for a while, but i finally decided it would be worth the effort to post. seeing more women my age become comfortable talking about sex and puberty, i’ve realized the lack of education i’ve had about my body. for the most part, i was handed a book and kinda figured it all out myself. my parents wanted to avoid the awkward conversations, which worked, but in turn i grew up with no knowledge of woman health. and from what i’ve seen online, this is not an uncommon thing. it’s frustrating how this last decade has been so empowering to women, but still lacks the strength to teach women about their bodies. even in sex ed at school we would learn all about men’s bodies, and the boners and wet dreams they would have. when we learned about women’s bodies, i learned what a period was and that was it. it feels like women’s health is taboo, and to a certain extent it is. contrary to popular belief, teaching a girl about her vagina before puberty is not going to ruin her childhood, it helps her understand what her body is doing. so i figured i would share some of the things that i wish i would’ve known as a preteen to maybe help parents or guardians of girls, and also shed some light on the sheer lack of sexual education women receive in schools. \n\nthis is all mostly coming from my experiences, i’m sorry if they aren’t accurate for everyone! also so sorry if there’s formatting issues, i’m on mobile. \n\n\n1. DISCHARGE \ndischarge seems so normal now that it’s weird to think about it not happening. but i’m here to remind all of you that there was an age when girls did not have discharge. nearly every girl i’ve talked with has had a similar experience when they started getting discharge, they thought they had cancer. not because there was something off in color or smell, they simply didn’t know that it was normal. to this day, i have never had anyone genuinely try to teach me about my vagina, especially about anything like discharge. if anyone is wondering, discharge is a natural, healthy, and COMPLETELY normal way of a vagina cleaning itself. vaginas actually self clean, there should never be a need to put soap up there or anything because it’s all under control! the problem comes when discharge shifts in color, to be more green, yellow, brown, or red, and also switches in smell. it’s important to pay attention to what your discharge looks like, but also be aware that having daily discharge is nothing strange or unordinary. \n\n2. BREAST CANCER CHECKS\none of the other few things i learned in sex ed was to check your breasts for tumors, and that feeling bumps inside of there is a sign of breast cancer. little did i know, there are actually milk ducts in your chest that you can feel! so along with many other girls i thought i had breast cancer based off of misinformation. \n\ni think what i’m getting at with most of this, is that you should tell your child how to self examine their own bodies for problems. that’s completely fine. BUT in turn teach them what is normal, and avoid that confusion and thoughts of cancer. \n\n3. PERIODS \njust some general period things that i think would’ve been nice to know, blood comes in many different colors, textures, and amounts. having a heavier flow does not mean that your vagina is “loose”, it just means your flow is heavier! tampon sizes mean nothing except how much they absorb. there is no shame in not wearing tampons or any other kind of inserted menstrual product, external products are just as great! everyone has a preference, and it doesn’t mean anything is wrong about you for using one thing rather than the other. it’s also extremely normal to have an irregular period at the beginning! sometimes you don’t settle into a regular cycle for well over a year, it’s completely normal. \n\n4. PET NAMES\nplease do not use a pet name when talking about genitalia. there’s nothing wrong with teaching children the word for a vagina or penis. it makes it uncomfortable when parents go out of their way to make it “kid friendly”, when it’s part of the human body. pet names have always never felt right to me, i don’t think that there’s anything wrong with using the correct terminology for genitalia. it makes the topic less uncomfortable, and it makes kids less embarrassed to talk to their parents about issues or questions they may have.\n\n5. THE HYMEN\noh wow is this a topic. the idea of virginity is already pretty fucked up, but on top of that the idea or purity around the hymen is very strange. \n\nkeep in mind, i am not meaning to offend any religions, religious beliefs, or cultures, i am just speaking about my opinion, as an american non religious woman, about the stigma around the hymen ( if i am being insensitive, please let me know :) ). \n\nthe idea of “virginity” is becoming more outdated as time goes on. is it the action of sexual penetration? how is virginity effected with same sex couples? and especially the idea of virginity is lost when the hymen breaks. if that logic is applied, hundreds of thousands of women have lost their virginity to tampons. some movement, such as riding a bike, can naturally stretch your hymen. it’s completely normal for your hymen to stretch and tear before you have sex. virginity is determined by you, because it’s your virginity. it’s demeaning and unfair to judge a woman’s purity on their hymen, especially when they can’t control when it breaks. the term “pop her cherry” is really demeaning, the hymen is not a indicator or sexual virginity. virginity has to do with sexual activity, not whether the hymen is present or not. ALSO on top of this, there is nothing wrong with being or not being a virgin. if you are comfortable with your sex life, you are doing great!\n\n6. ABSTINENCE \nit’s worth the time to correctly teach how to have safe sex. teaching abstinence doesn’t lead to no sex, it leads to STDs and teen pregnancy, because without safe sex education how are people going to know what safe sex is. abstinence does not stop sex, it stops safe sex. it’s impossible to stop an entire generation of teenagers from having sex, that’s not going to happen. it is completely worth it to teach what sex is and what it should be. this can lead to less teen pregnancy, which is always a good thing. \n\n\n\nit is worth the awkwardness to sit down and educate young women about their bodies. i knew more about the male anatomy than the female anatomy up until i was 15 years old, which is pretty bad. lots of confusion, especially with the idea of cancer, can be easily avoided with some body knowledge. every woman’s body is different and will behave differently, there is nothing wrong with yours ( unless you are experiencing some unhealthy symptoms, you might want to get that checked ). \n\nat the end of the day i mostly wanted to bring awareness to the lack of sex education women receive. to give you an idea, i have never met anyone who has genuinely known much about their body. i’ve known women who think they pee out of their vagina, because they were never taught any different. same goes for men’s view on women’s health. many men don’t really have a good idea on what a period is, unless they’ve been taught by other women, because sex education is so bad. all of this is no ones fault but the educators, how can we know what we aren’t educated on if we don’t know what it truly is. \n\nif there’s any young women reading this, don’t be afraid to ask questions to a trusted adult. i hope as your generation gets older, you will have had a better sex education than i did.\n\nEDIT: thank you so much for the awards! i’m comforted and also disappointed in the amount of women who can relate to this. keep educating and asking questions! i really appreciate all of the additions in the comments. there are no stupid questions, and no matter how old you are it’s important to learn about your body.",

    "text": "My wife’s friend sent this email to her and their friends to help start a conversation about abortion Let’s talk about abortion. Everyone else is. \nThe lawmakers who made it clear women are a commodity they don’t give a flying fuck about—they have shit to say. The women who live in fear that people with more power than brains get to govern our bodies—well, we’re talking too. \n\nBut the group I’d like to hear from—loudly—are the women who’ve actually fucking been through it. The women on ice cold operating tables in thin paper gowns. The women in depressing, chaotic Planned Parenthood waiting rooms. The women who made the undesirable, unpopular—and in some places—illegal choice. Until we hear more from that key demographic, we’re not getting anywhere very fast. It’s becoming clear that significant change happens faster when people speak up and point a spotlight at something that’s been hidden and taboo for too long: about their sexual assaults, about their diverse sexualities, about their wage discrepancies. About their abortions. \n\nI’ll start. \n\nI had two abortions, in two different Aprils, 10 years apart. The first time I got pregnant by a rich white man who had no desire to commit to me and treated me like trash. The second time I got pregnant by a rich white man who had no desire to commit to me and treated me like trash. I loved both of these men. Our respective babies would have been highly intelligent, creative, arguably attractive and, apparently, rich. Except in both cases, I would have been raising the child completely alone. \n\nTo raise my child alone in April of 2005: I would have dropped out of the grad school program I was working two jobs just to be in, the very same program where I met rich guy #1—a guy who slept through most of his classes, dropped out of coveted internships at famous advertising agencies with no notice, and did a lot of designer drugs with daddy’s bottomless money. I would have given up on a career I was turning out to be pretty fucking good at and moved back to my small, conservative town so my parents could help me sort this mess out. I was so young, scared and desperately in love with this guy that A) I was terrified to tell him I wasn’t on birth control when he came inside me without asking the first time we had sex—and once was all it took. Then B) I waited to tell him about either the pregnancy or the abortion until I thought we were becoming more serious. He found out when the other girl he was sleeping with caught wind of it and thought it would be funny to shame me by telling everyone about something sad and scary I had been through all alone. So hilarious, right? I guess you had to be there. \n\nTo raise my child alone in April of 2015: I would have sacrificed the career I’d scraped and fought to build over the course of a decade, spent $50K in student loans on, and weathered an abortion and a recession for. I’d just moved home from working in a fashionable European city and was settling back into the fashionable American city where I’d started my career. I had a whole damn life waiting back there for me. I was lucky enough to be making a healthy six-figure salary, I had a huge, supportive group of women friends, and, stupidly, I had a furtive sexual and emotional relationship with a close guy friend of many years whom I loved deeply. It might not have been so stupid if he was capable of loving me back. He wouldn’t even pick up the check for dinner the night I told him about the pregnancy and upcoming abortion appointment. We split it. A beautiful metaphor that pisses me off to this day. \n\nWow Lauren, you’re so irresponsible that you had not one but TWO abortions?, is what some people might be thinking. Sometimes what you might call irresponsibility is just shitty fucking luck. After abortion #1, I  found a birth control that worked for me for nearly 8 years, and I took it diligently, swallowing that pill first thing every morning. It was a tiny, daily prayer for control over my own future. Then I moved to Europe and spent the next 2 years bleeding out while trying every French birth control on the market. I was in a committed relationship with an amazing man who was sick of having our sex life sabotaged by these tiny little pills. He begged me to go off birth control and we used condoms religiously from then on. If the condom broke, we marched his French ass and my American ass across the street to the pharmacy for a 12€ morning after pill. Then quelle dommage, we broke up, I moved back to America, and two days later fell backwards into bed with my old friend, rich guy #2. Condoms didn’t suit his lifestyle and the pill that had once worked like a charm for 8 years suddenly turned on me. More bleeding. Suicidal thoughts. Unsustainable. Cue abortion #2. \n\nFor years, I was the only one I knew who’d had an abortion. The silence around the topic was deafening. Occasionally, for fun, I asked friends if they knew anyone who’d had an abortion and they said no. But they did, whether they knew it or not, because they knew me. I had a drunken conversation with my dad over Christmas 2005, wherein I confessed and, in solidarity, he admitted he’d gotten his teenage girlfriend pregnant in the dusty little town where I grew up. There, in the shadow of Texas itself, churches were many, and abortion clinics were few-to-none. Aside from this shocking and illuminating, less-than-festive holiday chat, I felt very alone. And though I was deeply at peace with my decisions—correction: deeply proud of the way I’d stood up for my own fucking future and my own fucking body—there was a shame that comes as a byproduct of feeling very alone. \n\nThen one day, almost offhandedly, the women in my life began to talk to me about their abortions. A colleague abroad. My creative partner at a different big-name agency. A college professor who’s a mentor to me. A boss who’s like a mother to me. A few people I barely fucking knew.\n\nTurns out, I have many friends who have terminated pregnancies. I have friends who have terminated pregnancies for health reasons. I have friends who have terminated pregnancies for timing reasons. For money reasons. For personal reasons that weren’t expressly communicated to me because it wasn’t my goddamn business. I have friends who have terminated pregnancies, then gone on to start a family when both the father and the timing were right. I have friends in loving, healthy partnerships who got pregnant and decided it wasn’t the right thing for them. I have friends who’ve terminated pregnancies that I don’t even know about. And so do you. And while a sum total of zero people owe me information about the hard shit they’ve been through, I do think that every single woman who speaks up gets us closer to the total autonomy of our bodies that every single one of us deserves. \n\nIf we don’t start normalizing this shit, the government will continue to preach their agenda-driven gospel that we are unfit to make decisions about our own bodies. And if we don’t step up and talk about it, we’ll never normalize it. Yes—it’s an incredibly private thing, and it’s an incredibly polarizing thing. And, yes, even a friend who is firmly pro-choice and marches for productive rights and is all up in Instagram with her self righteousness might lowkey judge you when she finds out you’ve actually had an abortion. Maybe some of you friends are judging me even now. That’s usually a reaction borne of society’s pervasive culture of judgment around this topic and that’s completely up to you. That’s the reaction the Texas lawmakers are hoping for, because it keeps everyone silent. But abortion saves lives. It saved mine twice. It gave me the right to live my life, the one I built with my own brain and my own money, as I saw fit—not a life based on a biological misfire by some rich asshole who decided a condom was just not fucking worth it in the long run. \n\nIs it fair that we have to rage and fight in order to be granted the baseline, the bare fucking minimum, of rights for our own bodies? Fuck no. The raging and fighting for civil rights wasn’t fair. The raging and fighting for gay rights wasn’t fair. This is a fucked up world. Still want to bring a child into it? If you do, it's 100% your right and it's 0% of my business.\n\nI love the babies of my friends, and the babies born into my family. I do not, however, want babies of my own. An occasionally unpopular opinion, to be sure. Between rings of birth control, boxes of condoms and two terminations, I’ve spent a LOT of money ensuring that I don’t have any. Sometimes it feels like fighting a losing battle, this trying not to have unwanted children—ask any woman who has tried not one but many different kinds of what turned out to be the wrong birth control and bled for months without stopping (ask me). Ask any woman who has had an IUD go rogue and permanently damage the inside of her body (ask my cousin). Ask any woman whose health insurance refused to cover the exorbitant cost of the aforementioned unreliable methods (ask my friends). Ask any woman for whom added hormones in her bloodstream caused depression, anger, hopelessness, and a feeling of being alien in her own body (ask the next woman you see). Ask any woman who’s had a man argue in defense of skipping the condom for just a little less hassle and a little more pleasure (ask every fucking woman I know). \n\nI have my reasons for not wanting babies. Some of them selfish? Yes, absolutely. I live in the shiny city they base all the movies on and I work hard and make a fuckload of money and I want to spend every single dime of it on myself. Or sometimes I want to spend it being a generous friend, daughter and sister. However, some of my reasons for not wanting babies are things like the planet we’ve trashed, the horrifying rising floodwaters of climate change, the footage of bloody school shootings and the untold horrors just over the horizon we can’t even see coming yet. COVID-19 being a casual example I’ll just toss out. In which case, not wanting to bring a child into a dangerous and dying world can feel like exactly the right move. Whether you have babies or you want babies or you’re quite not sure yet, it’s your fucking business. Full stop. \n\nAbortion is a fucking act of bravery. It’s taking 100% of the physical responsibility for something you were only 50% responsible for. Which is, by the way, what it is to be a woman who’s pregnant, in general—whether she carries the child to term or not. 100% of the physical responsibility for something you were only 50% responsible for. Biology is incredibly light in the logic department. \n\nI refuse to be held hostage by biology. I refuse to let the government or the church tell me they have a plan for my one precious life that’s bigger or smarter than my own. I refuse to stay silent any longer about this thing I did, twice, because it’s my body and my fucking right. I’m angry at the stigma and I’m sick of feeling like the government owns my body and lets me rent it out by the month. My kids would have been amazing and I don’t fucking miss them for a second. Abortion is family planning. Abortion is health care. Abortion is way more common than you think. Every woman has a story—whether it’s the time she was scared shitless she was pregnant and absolutely needed abortion to be an option, whether she was actually pregnant and went through with an abortion, or whether she knew someone else who did. Every woman has some kind of story. Now is a really good time to start telling yours.",

    "text": "Opinions On Ethnic Women Having Blonde Hair So, here's the situation. I recently dyed my hair blonde, and it took a lot for me to muster up the courage to not care about having blonde hair as an Asian-American. Of course, you see a bunch of Asian American women with a blonde balayage, and they look amazing with it. I have had light brown hair for over a year, and I just really felt inclined to switch it up late last year because I needed a fresh new start (things ended badly with the guy I was dating). I thought going blonde would help me feel more confident, but instead it makes me feel so weird about myself in public (especially when I am hanging out with my white friends). I have this perception that people think I am trying to be something I am not (\"act white\") and that as an Asian American, I should stick to the darker hair colors. I know that so many non-white women can rock the blonde hair (I was inspired by yanyanchan on IG) and that wanting to be blonde does not stem from a desire to look Caucasian. The blonde color is just pretty (especially when you wear so much black clothing) and can spice up your hair.\n\nI was just wondering what everyone's views are on this. Have any of you guys regretted going blonde or felt weird about being a blonde when you aren't white? I spent hundreds of dollars to go blonde, and now that I am, I feel like I should just go back to the salon and dye it brown/black again. I hate that I feel like this, but I've spent way too much time thinking about my hair. Even though my hair looks great and that I still think I look pretty, I just feel weirdly judged when I see people look at me in public.",

    "text": "The Supreme Court Order Regarding Texas HB8 Hi everyone, earlier today, I wrote the following and that you might want to use it in your arguments against Texas SB 8 and the Supreme Court's ridiculous unsigned order. This analysis was not written to defend abortion, because I don't think that will be beneficial in convincing a lot of people how dangerous this new law is. Instead, it takes the logic of the law and the Supreme Court's logic and extends them to their natural conclusions using examples of free speech, religious freedom, and gun rights. I hope that all of you find this helpful:\n\n\n Today, I weep for the Constitution, for yesterday the Supreme Court eviscerated both its importance and their own power. To start, my thoughts on abortion are irrelevant to this and many of you would be surprised where I stand. I am not writing about why abortion should or should not be illegal. The order issued by the Supreme Court yesterday has far reaching effects and that are not limited to abortion; indeed that stand to effect every right that you hold dear from gun ownership to free speech and everything in between. That is what I am writing about today – the slippery slope that the Supreme Court created and the map that the Supreme Court drew for states to pass laws that are unconstitutional on their face.\n\nTo understand how the Supreme Court got where it got and why it is so dangerous to the freedoms and Constitutional protections afforded to every American, you must first understand the diabolically clever law that was at issue before the Court yesterday – Texas SB 8. \n\nFirst a little background on the state of the constitutionality of abortion and SB8: Under Roe v Wade, Planned Parenthood v Casey, and their progeny, a state cannot make abortions illegal before the fetus is viable (that is the fetus could survive outside the mother’s womb), which occurs around 24 weeks into the pregnancy. Instead of making abortion illegal prior to 24 weeks, SB 8 created a private cause of action for any Texas citizen to bring a civil lawsuit against anyone who performs an abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected (or if the clinic fails to search for a heartbeat), which occurs at approximately 6 weeks of gestation. Under this private cause of action, anyone can sue anyone for at least $10,000 if they perform an abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected or if they aid someone in getting an abortion after fetal heartbeat (which aid can include paying for the abortion or even driving someone to the clinic). To summarize – abortions are not criminally “illegal” in Texas after 6 weeks, but if you perform one or aid someone in getting one you are subject to civil liability of at least $10,000 which civil suit can be brought by ANYONE even if they are not related to the fetus and even if they don’t even live in the same city as the mother and fetus. This enforcement scheme is wholly novel – in every other case that I am aware of, abortion bans are enforced by the state itself, not by private citizens.\n\nAfter SB 8 was passed, a Texas abortion clinic filed a lawsuit to have the law declared unconstitutional and to prevent its enforcement while the case was pending. This is the usual method that these cases are handled. In most cases a law that appears to be unconstitutional is passed, then someone or some group who will be affected by the law file a lawsuit naming various state employees and elected officials, then the law is stayed (put on pause and not enforceable) by the courts pending litigation, and then the courts decided whether the law is constitutional or not, giving time for briefing, argument, etc. – and this does take time; though the wheels of justice turn, they do so slowly. However, in this case the law is not actually enforced by the state – it’s enforced by civil actions, so the question arises of who to name in the lawsuit. In this case, the defendants were multiple the directors of multiple state agencies, a Texas district judge and court clerk, and an individual who threatened to sue people under the law. The theory in naming these people was to enjoin the government and judges from hearing the private lawsuits and to name a party who had previously said they would file such lawsuits to enjoin everyone from filing the lawsuits.  Multiple procedural actions occurred in the district court and in the 5th circuit, which ultimately let to an emergency motion in the Supreme Court asking the Court to enjoin (stop) enforcement of the law while the case proceeded on the merits. Again, this is what would ordinarily be done.\n\nHowever because the state isn’t actually enforcing the law itself, and is instead, essentially subcontracting that duty to private citizens on the promise of at least $10,000 in damages, the state argued that there isn’t anything to enjoin because no such lawsuits have been filed.\n\nUltimately, in a 5-4 unsigned order, the Supreme Court agreed with the defendants, saying “\\[the movants’’\\] application also presents complex and novel antecedent procedural questions on which they have not carried their burden \\[for an injunction to be issued\\].” Essentially, this means that the question of who to sue and who to enjoin makes it so the majority could not issue the injunction. However, this procedural quandary is one created by the State of Texas, itself! As stated by Chief Justice Roberts, in his dissent, “\\[t\\]he desired consequence \\[of private enforcement of the 6 week ban on abortions\\] appears to be to insulate the State from responsibility for implementing and enforcing the regulatory regime.” In effect, by granting the power to enforce otherwise unconstitutional bans on abortion, SB 8 has evaded constitutional scrutiny. As Justice Sotomayor wrote, in her scathing dissent:\n\n\"Taken together, the \\[Texas abortion law\\] is a breathtaking act of defiance—of the Constitution, of this Court’s precedents, and of the rights of women seeking abortions throughout Texas.\"\n\nShe goes on to write:\n\n\"Today, the Court finally tells the Nation that it declined to act because, in short, the State’s gambit worked. The structure of the State’s scheme, the Court reasons, raises “complex and novel antecedent procedural questions” that counsel against granting the application, ante, at 1, just as the State intended. This is untenable. It cannot be the case that a State can evade federal judicial scrutiny by outsourcing the enforcement of unconstitutional laws to its citizenry.\"\n\nThis statement, by Justice Sotomayor, is the heart of why I grieve for the Constitution today and shows how the majority of the Court undercut both its own power and the sanctity of the Constitution. In short, the Supreme Court has said that a state may pass a law that is unconstitutional on its face, but so long as it leaves enforcement of that law to the hands of private citizens, the Court will allow the law to stand.\n\nWhat does this mean and how can this be used? Almost everyone is familiar with the First Amendment and its general provisions – the government cannot prevent someone from speaking even if the government disagrees with the content of the speech; you cannot go to jail for criticizing the government. But, what if Governor Abbot and the Texas legislature got tired of the criticism heaped upon them by their opponents and simply passed a law that said “if a private citizen hears someone say something negative about the Governor or the Legislature, that citizen can sue the speaker for $10,000.” Though it is clearly unconstitutional for the government to throw you in jail for such speech, under the precedent set by the Supreme Court last night, such a law would be allowed to be enforced until a lawsuit was actually brought under the law (and maybe even after – apparently the majority of the Supreme Court believes it might not be able to enjoin such a law at all). What chilling effect would this have on speech? \n\nOr, another example – Multiple states issued emergency orders preventing religious gatherings of more than a certain number of people during the pandemic to prevent the spread of COVID. These laws were enforced by the government and the Supreme Court twice enjoined enforcement of these laws as unconstitutional. What if those laws instead said that the gatherings were legal, but private citizens could sue anyone who attended a religious gathering of more than 20 people for $5,000 per person? Under the precedent set last night, such a scheme is apparently allowable.\n\nOne final example – many states have tried to pass laws banning the possession of certain types of guns which have been struck down as unconstitutional. What if instead of making it criminally illegal to own such guns, they just created the ability for other citizens to sue you if you owned a gun the state didn’t like? Again, apparently acceptable according to the majority because the procedural questions are too complex for some of the greatest judicial minds to grasp. \n\nMy feelings on abortion are irrelevant to the legal significance of this case. The majority of the supreme court has undercut the Constitution itself and the effects could be far and wide reaching. The very basis of our freedoms is apparently unenforceable if a state gets cute and simply subcontracts enforcement to private citizens. Your rights – all of them – are in jeopardy today.",

If they allow this perversion of American law, then consider our Supreme Court defunct. \n\nI have the privilege of being in Colorado after fleeing the South, due to these kinds of politics becoming prevalent and violently harmful to my state. That doesn't mean I am not terrified for others.",

    "text": "Bad taste in men? I wish I could help... I have this friend and, I have known her since college. She is an absolutely gorgeous, fit, successful, intelligent and wonderful Philippino-American woman and mother. I'd dare say, the worst thing she has going for her, is her taste in men. I wouldn't say she had a type but, she is the kind of woman who wants to love and be loved, and she gets taken advantage of... In the past, relationships have had the chance to run their course. Despite my pointing out the red flags in the shape of people, I couldn't convince her not to marry a guy, even after she brought the red flags to me and asked if she should. I was like, \"Yeah. That's a problem that's going to be a problem.\" I let her make her own decision and, sure enough they weren't married a year before he got caught cheating again and they divorced. She met another guy and had a child with him. I haven't been very present but, he seemed okay and they broke up eventually for some reason.\n\nWhat prompts me to write this is, she started dating a guy with previous wounds still fresh. They moved pretty quickly and were only together for a couple of months but, she thought he was the best man ever. They had all these grand plans. She was falling hard in love. Her kid really liked him. Then he died in a tragic, yet completely preventable accident, had he been a responsible human being and worn a God Damned Helmet. Now she is absolutely devastated. \n\nTheir relationship was fresh and she held him on such a high pedestal. At a glance, I would have visually assumed he was probably kind of scummy (based on his personal style choices) but, she says so many good things about him, I just told myself, \"I can't judge a book by it's cover.\" \n\nSince his passing, she has been posting these stories about their time together and how their hangouts were initiated and, while many people would see a gesture as romantic, I can't help but see them as red flags...\n\nI mean... Tell me this isn't shady as fuck. She has a day off and, coincidentally, he invites her to meet him at a nearby bar when he \"has to be at work in 2 hours.\" She then gives him a ride home, where he packs a fucking weekend bag and says he is blowing off work to stay with her... Then he obviously leaves his shit at her house so he has to go back. Obviously she enjoyed their time together and leaving his stuff wasn't a big deal to her but, from the outside, I see what he was doing.\n\nNow he is dead and she is crushed that the best man she has ever met just upped and died and she will never find anything like that again. Now, I'm of the mind that, had enough time passed, the facade would have fallen away and he would have revealed his character... I just don't know what is worse... I wish I could slap her and tell her to just get over it but, obviously that isn't a viable option in maintaining a friendship... I just have to let her get through it on her own time.  Maybe it will be a plus if she never dates again...\n\nEdit: Somebody, we don't know who, anonymously did something far more directly hurtful than just vent on Reddit. I don't want to be specific... Sure, I wasn't a fan of the guy but, she can grieve and process as long as she needs (that's why I'm keeping it out of the group)... What that person did... It's just... what in the actual fuck? It is literally an act of fraud. Why would ANYBODY do that?! A violation of privacy I couldn't imagine anyone who calls themselves a friend doing... I told my husband and he immediately said, \"it's her mom,\" but I think her mom is better than that.",

    "text": "This comment on a TIL article had 600 upvotes when I checked and discussed the actual literacy rates of students in America. I'm just going to quote the comment's relevant portion. As a seventh-grade ELA teacher in a middle class district, this largely reflects my experience.\n\nWhat gets me is that, again, you have comments about how you OP should run for school board. People still see education as a vacuum in whcih the educational issues are educator's issues. What people still seem to not understand is that modern education isn't a problem, it's a reflection of American society writ large. Certainly education has its flaws, but the issue isn't confined to education.\n\nAlso people seem genuinely surprised that huge swaths of kids are multiple grade levels behind. Uh, I think besides my honors ELA class, 60-80% of my students aren't reading at grade level.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/rqulik/til_that_according_to_the_us_department_of/hqdm6d6/\n\n>It’s so depressing. My SO is an 8th grade ELA (English) teacher and what she tells me genuinely scares me. Totally matches up with everything you are reading above and in other parts of this post.\n\n>I help her grade sometimes and it is TERRIFYING that most of these kids are even in 8th grade. Many of them if I handed their writing to you and asked you to guess what grade you would say 2nd-3rd. Some of them can barely write at all. And I mean AT ALL. No idea how to form a sentence or a paragraph.\n\n>It’s a daunting task for her. Especially for the kids that actually are on level, because how is she supposed to challenge them when the majority of their peers are years behind? Im proud of her because at the beginning of the year she made her goal to serve the kids who are actually on level as well as she can. The thought behind that is so many of the kids are years behind, so most of her colleagues have their main goal as to help some of the kids catch up some. Her fear is there is so much focus on getting kids caught up some, which is important obviously (especially for test scores which is how the admin/state judges their performance as teachers), but that means the few kids who are actually reading/writing on level or above it end up not getting served by their teachers, and often times just stagnate. They become jaded to education because they aren’t challenged, are neglected, and feel less important than their peers who are behind. So my SO has made it her priority to give those kids the same amount of attention, even though it makes for more work for her, as it calls for her to create entirely different assignments, but it is worth it to her,she goes out of her way to challenge those kids.",

    "text": "I want a summer job that's fulfilling and decent-paying? Are there jobs like that for me? So, first, I'm not a student. I just have a job where things die down a lot in the summer, and I'm in a place where I could do a little work in the summer. I kinda like having something on the side. I'd like to do something that does some good in the world, even if in a convoluted way, but it needs to pay enough that I don't feel like walking away when the job has its inevitable tough moments.\n\nI should say, there are so many interesting internships out there, but they're reserved for students. I really wish some might be open to random 35 yo guys. \n\nIn terms of qualifications, I have a law degree, a PhD in the humanities. I haven't practiced law much, and I'm not sure I'd want to, especially since I only have the summer. I've done some consulting work for state government on crime and punishment issues, since that's related to my main work. I've done teaching related to my areas of expertise at every level from middle school to postgraduate. I've served on nonprofit boards for performing arts stuff as well as legal stuff. I've done fundraising, but I'm not interested in doing that again, at least not as a significant part of my day.\n\nI had an offer for a perfect thing back in 2020. The job was introducing high school kids to the American legal system over 6 weeks. It was some classroom instruction stuff plus taking lots of field trips to meet local judges, civil servants, and politicians. It paid 2k per week. Then COVID happened, and it was cancelled for the summer, and then this year, I learned that the entire program was cancelled.\n\nI've really like the consulting work, but it's just too irregular. Someone asked me to blog 2x per week about national crime and punishment stories for 3k for the entire year. That's just not worth my time. Someone suggested that I run a particular summer camp for kids, and that sounds like fun but also challenging. The camp would pay $1k per week, but that might not be enough reward for the headaches.\n\nAnyway, I'm looking for suggestions. I've mostly mentioned white collar stuff in the legal or education sectors, but I'm not above doing other stuff. Years ago, for a few months, my spouse and I rented two apartments, and I did Airbnb for the smaller one. This was just great. I honestly enjoyed getting the place ready for new guests. I would consider Uber if I were a better driver and not overly concerned about wear and tear to my car. \n\nI'm open in terms of area. I'd like to stay in the US, especially East Coast or Midwest, but I'm genuinely open.\n\nAnyway, any help you can offer would be appreciated. And if there's anything I can clarify, I'm happy to do so. I don't really wanna talk about my current job, but just assume that there are no conflicts, no restrictions on what I can do, and I have perfect job security. It's completely remote in summer, and the workload is usually less than 1 hour per week. (I did get slammed with 80 hours one week this past summer, but they did ask if I had the bandwidth before giving it to me. I could've said no.)",

    "text": "**Hoping for better grades in the Spring?** Here's a comprehensive guide on how to study and do well in law school, while staying sane, from a successful T14 3L **Hello 1Ls!** Now that Fall grades are released and the Spring semester is almost upon us, some of you are inevitably disappointed by the results. That's OK! You can turn things around in the Spring, but only if you take some time to reflect on what went right and what went wrong so that you can improve your strategies. To help with that process, I wanted to repost the 1L guide that I shared here a few months ago. The way Reddit works, many of you probably never saw it, and still others may have forgot. It's the exact same advice I've given my 1L mentees over the past two years, who report that it was super helpful in allowing them to beat the curve. In particular, the \"productivity\" section at the end might be helpful in analyzing what you did last time.\n\n\nAs always, feedback from other 2/3Ls and grads is encouraged!\n\n\n**Original post:**\n\nHi friends! 3L at UVA here. I recently put together these notes as part of some advice I was giving to our incoming 1Ls. Given the explosion of \"holy crap I'm a 1L and am totally overwhelmed, help!\" posts floating around the sub, I figured it might be helpful to share these tips with the rest of you. They should apply to any school, but check with your professors and/or older students if you're not sure. If you're reading this later in the semester, you can also check out advice I posted last year for the [last month before finals](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/dtiy6y/detailed_game_plan_for_finals_for_all_the_anxious/) and advice for [taking the final exam itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/e7m4uz/for_1ls_a_detailed_guide_on_how_the_hell_you/). For the sake of establishing credibility, yes, I did very well in law school based on the approach outlined below. I've also received a ton of excellent advice from older students, my classmates, and the internet, which has been incorporated into my personal strategy over time. If you want further reading, [this excellent collection of resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/hum9n5/aggregated_content_for_rising_1ls_and_others/) by moderator [/u/Hstrat](https://www.reddit.com/u/Hstrat/) is a great place to go next and includes sources that influenced my tips below.\n\nHappy to turn this into a psuedo-AMA if you have questions!\n\n**Fellow 2/3Ls & grads** \\- I welcome any comments, criticism, or additional suggestions you want to add!\n\n**Caveats/Intro**\n\n* No advice is “correct” (including this), just suggestions to try for yourself\n* No one will ever see your notes/outlines/flashcards/etc, only the exam itself\n* The exam is 100% of your grade, so focus on that\n\n   * Your entire semester should work backwards from the exam\n   * Obviously if your syllabus says otherwise, adjust accordingly\n\n**Sleep/health/caffeine/drinking**\n\n* Your physical and mental health are important for obvious human reasons  \n\n   * They are ALSO critically important for grades\n* 1L is a marathon, not a sprint\n* You WILL burnout eventually  \n\n   * The question is when, how bad, and how fast can you bounce back?\n   * Delaying burnout and mitigating its intensity is key; health is critical to this\n* The increased brainpower, efficiency, and speed of being healthy, well-rested, and mentally/emotionally centered vastly outpaces any time “lost” from not studying more\n* Specifically: Sleep, exercise, diet, relaxation, reasonable levels of caffeine/alcohol/drugs  \n\n   * Sleep is absolute king here\n   * An hour of sleep is more valuable than an hour of anything else, including studying, job applications, exercise, socializing, etc. because it makes all of those activities way better/easier during the rest of the day\n\n**General life/social stuff**\n\n* Warn your family, friends, partner, etc. that law school is really intense and that 1L Fall is by far the most important semester  \n\n   * It will NOT be that bad, but it’s wise to set their expectations low and have them be pleasantly surprised that you’re available, rather than be mad that you’re not available enough\n   * They should be under the impression that your life will be 100% taken up by studying, until you’re comfortable enough with your schedule to inform them otherwise\n* Be nice to everyone, don’t start drama  \n\n   * This is all so much easier when you get along\n   * Contribute to and take advantage of the support network!\n   * Remember that every classmate will also be lawyer, in a very small world, and it’s better to be friends with the hiring partner, opponent, client, attorney general, judge, whatever than to have them remember when you tried to fight them on the softball field lol\n\n**Pacing/high-level overview**\n\n* Common mistakes: burnout too early, or (less common) slack until the end  \n\n   * You CANNOT push yourself round the clock in the library all day every day all semester – literally nobody can keep up this pace forever  \n\n      * Every year people try this, burn themselves out, and get wrecked in finals\n   * You should assume that you are totally average until 1L grades tell you otherwise  \n\n      * If you’re insecure that you’re not smart enough, you’re probably wrong (chances are you’re average)\n      * If you’re overconfident because you think you’re smarter than everyone else, you’re also probably wrong (chances are you’re average too)\n* You need a plan, and it should be ambitious but reasonable  \n\n   * Plan for problems/interruptions/sickness/distraction\n   * Leave slack in your schedule each week, and across the semester as a whole\n* Each hour of your time becomes more valuable the closer you get to finals  \n\n   * Thus, try to front-load tasks as much as possible without burning out\n\n**Work backwards from the exam**\n\n* The exam is the only thing that matters\n* Repeat: **THE EXAM IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS**  \n\n   * Plan the entire semester based on this realization\n   * Cases are important for learning, but pretty unimportant for the exam  \n\n      * Repeat: they *ARE important*, just not while sitting in the exam\n* So start by figuring out: what does the exam look like?  \n\n   * **NOTE**: Check the format with your professor, on the off-chance that it’s different… but most will be like this:\n   * A series of hypotheticals that you will need to analyze, often w/ little guidance, and write about in a Word doc for the professor (at some schools this may be done via special exam software but the content is the same)\n   * Extreme time pressure\n   * (Usually) open-book, open-note, even open-internet\n   * Blind grading (professor has no idea who you are)  \n\n      * Notably, they also don't know whether you nailed a cold call or bombed it\n   * Cases are used only for their key takeaway/rule, and maybe to analogize the most important facts to the exam hypo  \n\n      * *At most* you might say something like “Necessity is not a defense to murder (*Dudley*), so in this case John wouldn’t be able to raise it.”\n      * Or something like, “The workers here are independent contractors, but unlike the anesthesiologists in *Roessler*, they don’t seem to have apparent authority.”\n      * This kind of unofficial “citation” to a case is not only the maximum you’d have to do, it’s honestly more than most professors would expect or care about – you DO NOT have to even use cases to this degree\n      * The point is, a few days/weeks from now, when you’re spending so much time learning cases, reflect back on these examples in this post, and realize how little information you’ll actually use from them on the exam\n* So, now that you know what the exam involves, what sorts of tools would probably help you during the exam?  \n\n   * A gigantic, well-organized document with all the information from the class, that you can CTRL-F to find things  \n\n      * This is an “outline”\n   * Your raw class notes to CTRL-F in case you missed something  \n\n      * This is why you should take good notes\n   * A shorter document laying out only the most important info as a reminder, that you can glance at quickly mid-exam  \n\n      * This is an “attack outline”\n   * Other visual aids?  \n\n      * An excel database of cases w/ key info?\n      * Flowcharts?\n      * Other creative ideas?\n   * Knowing your professor’s opinions, preferences, quirks\n   * Practice: having done a very similar exam multiple times before  \n\n      * AKA “practice exams”\n   * General familiarity with the content from constant exposure  \n\n      * AKA consistent studying and review all semester\n* What will probably NOT help you during the exam:  \n\n   * Memorization (because it’s open note)\n   * Flashcards\n   * Details of case facts\n   * Full case briefs\n   * In-depth reasoning of majority/dissent\n   * Historical cases that are no longer relevant\n   * Highlighting in your casebook\n   * Rambling about general legal concepts not directly related to hypo\n   * Policy/theory/ethics  \n\n      * UNLESS explicitly asked, or specific prof likes it\n   * The opinions, preferences, quirks of your classmates\n* Thus, **devote more time to developing things that will help and less time to things that won’t help**  \n\n   * Don’t spend time on things just because they feel like “work” (ex. writing out a 2-page analysis of each case you read, making flashcards), or because your classmates are doing it, or older students say to do it, or even because professors say to do it (it’s been probably decades since they were in school)  \n\n      * **This includes not blindly listening to ME either!** Think critically and carefully about each task and consider whether it will really help you come exam time\n      * Solicit suggestions from 2/3Ls, classmates, profs, the internet, and try out their methods…. But be prepared to adapt to your own way, or toss them out\n* I have way more to say about exam nitty-gritty and strategy, but that should wait until much later in the semester  \n\n   * When the time comes, check out my post about [preparing for exams during the final month of the semester](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/dtiy6y/detailed_game_plan_for_finals_for_all_the_anxious/), followed by my post detailing [specific strategies for writing the exam itself once you're sitting in it](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/e7m4uz/for_1ls_a_detailed_guide_on_how_the_hell_you/)\n\n**Taking notes in class**\n\n* By far the most important thing you can do\n* The professor is judge, jury, and executioner of your exam  \n\n   * If you, the book, or supplements ever disagree with the professor, the professor is always right (for the exam anyway)\n   * Many profs will encourage you to challenge their ideas, either in class or in office hours…. But when it comes to the exam, follow what they think\n   * If you get a policy/political question, you may choose to argue a point that your prof disagrees with, if it’s truly a debatable non-settled non-legal question  \n\n      * But when it comes to “how does Torts work” your prof is always correct\n* For most profs, 99.9% of the information you’ll need will come up in class at some point (either from the prof, or from discussion w/ students)  \n\n   * This is part of why devoting too much time to reading/briefing isn’t worth it – you’ll get the info in class\n* Pay attention, take lots of notes, fill any holes either by asking classmates, revisiting the recordings, or going to office hours\n* Take your notes for each subject in one big combined Word doc, NOT separate docs for each class period (ex. all Crim notes in a single doc, not \"Crim August 26th\" and \"Crim August 28th\")\n\n   * Trust me, this will save you enormous time and effort later\n   * You can also use more sophisticated tools like One Note if you know how\n* If you handwrite, you will HAVE to transfer them to electronic form at some point so you can use them for outlining and during the exam  \n\n   * Probably smart to set up a routine for doing this each week or other similar time period\n* Follow whatever style and format works best for your brain - nothing else matters\n\n**Reading**\n\n* Timing: probably good to get ahead, at least by a couple days  \n\n   * Aspire to finish the semester’s reading early if you can\n   * By reading ahead, you leave room for problems (if you get sick or have some deadline or are burned out, the punishment is being back on normal pace, rather than falling behind)\n   * BUT consider that being too far ahead means you forget details and can mess up cold calls  \n\n      * Probably good to do a quick refresh right before class\n   * Start to track how long it takes to read each page (this may be different for each class)  \n\n      * Not to be a gunner, but so that you can accurately estimate time for each assignment\n      * You *will* get faster as the semester goes on (often significantly faster) - this is part of the normal law school process\n* Read every word carefully the first time through\n* Try really hard to understand what’s going on factually and legally\n* Try to figure out how each judge is making their arguments\n* Practice distilling the key questions:  \n\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, what are the facts?\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, what legal rule comes out of this?\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, what did the dissent say (if any)?\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, is there any other context/info from book?\n   * Ex. *R v. Dudley & Stevens*  \n\n      * Facts: “Two guys starving on boat eat third guy”\n      * Law: “Rule: necessity is not a valid defense to murder”\n      * Context: “This is an old English case and American law is a bit different now”\n* Probably smart to write down those super brief, super important summaries in case you get cold called, though it’s not strictly necessary  \n\n   * However….\n\n**Briefing**\n\n* CONTROVERSIAL: should you write down *all* of those facts, details, arguments, and legal minutiae from the reading?  \n\n   * This is called “briefing”\n   * Doing this is part of traditional law school advice, but highly controversial\n   * There seems to be a modern trend away from briefing\n* Briefing pros:  \n\n   * Cold calls are way easier\n   * You never need to revisit the book because it’s all there\n   * Helps some people remember facts/arguments/details better\n   * May force you to understand things better\n* Briefing cons:  \n\n   * Takes an absolutely enormous amount of time\n   * Most of the information is unnecessary outside of cold calls\n   * Will never be used on an actual exam\n   * You can survive a cold call without it\n   * People often become too reliant on them as a crutch\n   * Seriously, an enormous f\\*cking amount of time\n* Some people swear by briefing, including some very successful students\n* But many, including me, think they’re a waste of time  \n\n   * The ratio of time required to value gained is insanely wasteful\n   * They mostly help cold calls… and cold calls have no impact on your grade\n   * Many people study tons of hours and burn out… yet get bad grades?  \n\n      * Too much time spent briefing is often the culprit\n      * Briefing *feels like* you’re being productive and *feels like* you’re “learning” and “being a good law student” and “accomplishing something”… but many people discover come exam time that **those efforts don’t translate into results**\n   * Easy to be too perfectionist or worry about things like formatting, that no one will ever see\n   * Try it, maybe it works for you, but be ready to abandon if necessary\n   * Only do it if  \n\n      * a) you have no other more valuable tasks to do and\n      * b) are totally well-rested, relaxed, and bored and need no rest time\n   * I would much rather spend an hour reading ahead, outlining, doing practice exams (late in the semester), doing career services tasks, taking care of personal errands, making flowcharts, revising my notes, reviewing my notes, etc. than I would an hour of briefing\n   * I would also much rather spend an hour sleeping, partying, watching Netflix, jogging, etc. than an hour briefing, because my energy will recharge and make be more productive at other more important tasks\n* MIDDLE GROUND: “Book Briefing”  \n\n   * Highlight important things\n   * Make notes in the margins\n   * Don’t actually write out a full brief\n   * Many people like this solution\n\n**Outlining**\n\n* Sounds scarier than it is  \n\n   * Literally just compile your notes into one big document, edit it a bit, and format so it’s easy to look stuff up/organize\n   * If you add something to the outline you don’t understand or remember, revisit your notes/book/friends/supplements/professor to figure it out  \n\n      * Eventually you’ll understand everything\n* Use old outlines!  \n\n   * Everyone agrees you shouldn’t just use an old outline straight up (and sometimes profs don’t allow it)\n   * But you don’t necessarily need to take the time to build one from scratch\n   * Either take an old one and modify it to your liking, or build your own but use the old ones as a reference to save time and make sure you don’t screw up\n   * Many schools have an outline bank\n   * Many student orgs have outline banks\n   * Your PAs should provide old outlines, as will student org mentors (ask them!)  \n\n      * Unless your school doesn't have PAs or mentors, of course\n* It’s an iterative process – the outline is never “done”  \n\n   * You want to compile the information in a way that is both comprehensive and easy to navigate in your brain  \n\n      * Remember that you’ll be flipping through or CTRL-Fing it urgently to look up something during an exam\n      * Information recall speed and organization are key\n* It’s also a critical learning experience as you fit all the conceptual pieces together in your head and organize them in ways your brain understands  \n\n   * This is the main reason relying solely on old outlines is a problem\n* Ideally you should add to your outlines bit by bit as the semester goes on  \n\n   * BUT note that you will not be capable of doing much of the connective intellectual work until the end of the semester when you’ve seen enough of the class to understand how things fit\n* An “attack outline” is literally just your outline, but slimmed down so it’s faster to look stuff up\n\n**Practice Exams**\n\n* Don’t worry about this until like, November\n* But once you get to the last few weeks, and certainly reading period and finals, these will be critically important\n* Most profs will give you old exams, though some wait until late in the semester  \n\n   * If not, ask\n   * If you can’t get them, try to find exams from other profs, or the internet\n   * DON’T ask a 2/3L for them, because schools tend to get very touchy about it and you don't want to get the 2/3L (or yourself) in trouble\n* You really really really need to get hands on practice applying your knowledge and resources to hypos\n* You WILL feel panicked the first time you’re staring at a hypo and a blank page but you’ll figure it out  \n\n   * You want to work through this experience on a practice, not the real thing\n\n**Think outside the box**\n\n* That’s basically it for traditional law school study techniques, but feel free to experiment\n* I personally started using Excel spreadsheets and found them ultra useful - [here's an example](https://www.reddit.com/user/Oldersupersplitter/comments/iiuucb/excel_cases_outline_example/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n   * Each case (including the minor note cases) gets a line with the name, year, the topic, a few words of facts, and a very brief overview of why it matters\n   * I can see the entire possible body of law for each topic on a single screen\n   * You start to notice trends and connections differently than in Word\n* Flowcharts  \n\n   * I love flowcharts, and as a 2L used flowcharts almost exclusively during the actual exams (with other traditional tools available if needed) - here is [a link with some examples](https://www.reddit.com/user/Oldersupersplitter/comments/idkyr8/flowchart_examples/)\n   * There are white boards in many library study rooms\n   * I’ve now moved to the [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) website and find it easier to do electronically\n\n**Structuring your semester, revisited**\n\n* Now that we know what everything is….\n* Your #1 job is staying on top of the readings and class notes  \n\n   * Preferably staying slightly ahead on reading\n   * At the start, this is really your only goal\n* Review/revisit material periodically to refresh it and find connections  \n\n   * Some people do this at the end of each week, every couple weeks, etc\n* Talk to your classmates, talk to profs in office hours, try to learn wtf is going on\n* Look for old outlines day one, and refer to them as needed even before making your own\n* Start building your outlines and/or modifying old ones  \n\n   * Some people add a little each week, others only after 4-6 weeks, some at the end\n   * No correct answer, but certainly it’s good to at least start by November 1 if you can\n* In the second half of the semester, the focus shifts more and more from reading into outlining\n* In the final month, 90% of your time should be spent on outlining, practice exams, and filling in holes in your understanding  \n\n   * Those last two are more important than outlines, which is why it’s good to aim for progress on outlines early\n* Plan out the days you’ll prepare for each final, way before you need to  \n\n   * I like to give myself 30 days before the first final: one week per class, then two days at the end to cram before the first final\n   * Then, as soon as you take a final, forget everything and spend all of your time prepping for the next one, and so on until you’re done\n   * Plan to be ultra burned out after each final  \n\n      * If you can study, great\n      * But you will almost certainly not have the mental or emotional capacity to  study until the next day, maybe that evening at best, so don’t rely on that time when you’re planning\n\n**Study groups**\n\n* Can be incredible helpful\n* Can also be a huge distraction\n* Very very important for reviewing practice exams at the very end\n* Probably worth trying them, at least with one other student to bounce things off of\n* Be extremely cautious about wasting time  \n\n   * Your classmates are probably cool and interesting, and if you become besties, you might spend all your time chatting and enjoying each other’s company instead of studying\n   * It’s good to have a concrete game plan for each study session - save the socializing for when you go to the bar *after* an efficient and productive study session (both the studying and the drinking will be improved this way)\n   * Later in the semester, you can even calendar specific things to cover on specific days\n* Don’t be afraid to include people from the other section(s) that share your professors!\n\n**Productivity in general**\n\n* There are many common suggestions and tips for productivity that I won’t write about for pages and pages here because you can look them online or in books (and by getting to this point, you’re probably respectably productive anyway)  \n\n   * However, here are some law school-specific thoughts that I have based on not only my own experience, but also the experiences of my 3L friends and the 1Ls I’ve mentored...\n* ***If you tell me you “studied 10 hours in the library….”***\n* First, law students love to exaggerate these things (so don’t freak out when your classmates mention stuff like this), but let’s assume you actually did 10 hours\n* Second, how much time during those 10 hours were you ACTUALLY studying?  \n\n   * Many many many people, myself included, will go to the library or their desk at home to “study” but find themselves constantly distracted by the obvious things (facebook, games, online shopping, news, etc) but also less obvious things:  \n\n      * Talking to friends/study group about stuff that is not relevant to class\n      * Getting into deep philosophical arguments about legal theory that will make a great paper someday but have nothing to do with 1L exams\n      * Thinking about all the money you’ll make in BigLaw\n      * Thinking about how you’re going to save the world in PI\n      * Reading some interesting but irrelevant legal tangent because you don’t want to look at Torts any more that day\n      * Listening to friends in other sections talk about how *their* Contracts class is going\n      * Picking out the exact right shade of highlighter for highlighting today’s notes\n      * And so on…\n   * Sometimes you know that you’re not being productive if it’s Instagram, but many of these things I listed above might *feel like* you’re productive because they’re “about the law” or at least “law adjacent”  \n\n      * And hey, many of these things are great and valuable and you should do them…. But don’t count them as “study time” in your schedule or your head, because you will fool yourself into thinking you put in more hours than you did\n      * Instead, use your study time to *actually study* and then spend the same amount of time doing all that other stuff I listed but block it out during a *separate time* in the day\n      * You may end up with MORE time to do these things that interest you because you power through the real studying all at once, and then feel free to go on tangents and socialize to your hearts content without being chained to the library desk\n* Third, when you really truly are “studying,” what **specifically** does that mean and is it the most effective task at this moment?  \n\n   * This basically plays into everything I described about study habits above\n   * There are lots of tasks that do technically count as studying, and hey maybe you do them for 4 straight hours without talking to anyone or checking facebook…. But they don’t actually help you for the exam (or only help a little bit)\n   * Here is where briefing really ruins a lot of people, in my opinion\n   * What are some other examples of tasks I’ve heard of classmates doing that waste time (or that I’ve done myself and realized my mistake)?  \n\n      * Re-reading the case multiple times after already discussing it in class (just revisit your notes at that point)\n      * Reading parts of the textbook that aren’t in the syllabus\n      * Reading supplements for topics that aren’t in the syllabus\n      * Memorizing facts (unless you get the rare closed book exam)\n      * Making flashcards (same thing)\n      * Looking up the history around an area of law, or the voluminous academic scholarship around it (probably interesting, maybe valuable in the grand sense for your education, but do it in “non-study” time because it has no bearing on the exam unless the prof says it does or you’re very confident it will come up)\n      * Briefing (in my opinion)\n* **IF** you only spend your study time doing **effective, high-value tasks** (*assigned* reading, outlining, practice exams, reviewing notes, making visual aids for the exam, finding explanations to topics you don’t understand, filling in holes in your notes) and you also spend your “study time” **actually studying** without distraction  \n\n   * You will find that **the number of hours required to prepare thoroughly and get good grades is** **much smaller than you’d think**, and much smaller than the amount of time most students “study”\n   * This is how some people “magically” get good grades while also going to Bar Review, maintaining a relationship, playing video games, taking weekends off, etc.  \n\n      * And, because they have left so many hours each day/week to rest and relax, their brains are in a better position to perform well when it comes to study or take the exam!!\n* Of course, **I guarantee you will be nowhere near perfect** at this at the start, or even by the end of the first semester  \n\n   * But you should aspire toward efficiency and constantly ask yourself, *for you and the way YOU study effectively*, “am I actually studying during study time?” and “are my study tasks effective & efficient?”",

Recent UVA grad here. Congrats on finishing your first week of law school! I originally posted this guide a year ago, and have received countless messages ever since about how helpful it was. I wanted to repost it again now so that the new incoming 1Ls could see it and hopefully find it useful too.\n\n\nWhen I was a 1L, I was lucky enough to get lots of sage advice from Reddit, TLS, and older students at UVA. I wanted to pay it forward, and ask you to do the same. This guide represents all of the things I personally learned myself, advice I received over the years, and comments by dozens of top-performing students at UVA and other T14s who have given me feedback and helped me improve the contents. Historically, my 1L mentees who followed this guide have performed extremely well.\n\n\n\nWhen the time comes, you should also check out (1) [this post about what to do in the last month before finals, which focuses heavily on outlining](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/dtiy6y/detailed_game_plan_for_finals_for_all_the_anxious/) and (2) [this post about how exactly to write the exam itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/e7m4uz/for_1ls_a_detailed_guide_on_how_the_hell_you/).\n\n\nRemember that there is no \"right way\" to do law school, *including* my advice in this guide. You should listen to as much guidance as you can, then try things and decide what works for you personally. Nobody grades you on how you prepared, only on the final result in the exam room. [This post by moderator Hstrat](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/ng7e4z/aggregated_content_for_rising_1ls_and_others/) contains a priceless collection of other guides and AMAs across the internet that you should read as well, including some that helped me as a 1L several years ago. I recommend paying attention to even the ones that disagree with me :)\n\n\nFeel free to ask any questions below. Happy to turn this into a sort of AMA if that's helpful.\n\n**Caveats/Intro**\n\n* No advice is “correct” (including this), just suggestions to try for yourself\n* No one will ever see your notes/outlines/flashcards/etc, only the exam itself\n* The exam is 100% of your grade, so focus on that\n\n   * Your entire semester should work backwards from the exam\n   * Obviously if your syllabus says otherwise, adjust accordingly\n\n**Sleep/health/caffeine/drinking**\n\n* Your physical and mental health are important for obvious human reasons  \n\n   * They are ALSO critically important for grades\n* 1L is a marathon, not a sprint\n* You WILL burnout eventually  \n\n   * The question is when, how bad, and how fast can you bounce back?\n   * Delaying burnout and mitigating its intensity is key; health is critical to this\n* The increased brainpower, efficiency, and speed of being healthy, well-rested, and mentally/emotionally centered vastly outpaces any time “lost” from not studying more\n* Specifically: Sleep, exercise, diet, relaxation, reasonable levels of caffeine/alcohol/drugs  \n\n   * Sleep is absolute king here\n   * An hour of sleep is more valuable than an hour of anything else, including studying, job applications, exercise, socializing, etc. because it  makes all of those activities way better/easier during the rest of the  day\n\n**General life/social stuff**\n\n* Warn your family, friends, partner, etc. that law school is really intense and that 1L Fall is by far the most important semester  \n\n   * It will NOT be that bad, but it’s wise to set their expectations low and have them be pleasantly surprised that you’re available, rather than be mad that you’re not available enough\n   * They should be under the impression that your life will be 100% taken up by studying, until you’re comfortable enough with your schedule to inform them otherwise\n* Be nice to everyone, don’t start drama  \n\n   * This is all so much easier when you get along\n   * Contribute to and take advantage of the support network!\n   * Remember that every classmate will also be lawyer, in a very small world, and it’s better to be friends with the hiring partner, opponent, client, attorney general, judge, whatever than to have them remember when you tried to fight them on the softball field lol\n\n**Pacing/high-level overview**\n\n* Common mistakes: burnout too early, or (less common) slack until the end  \n\n   * You CANNOT push yourself round the clock in the library all day every day all semester – literally nobody can keep up this pace forever  \n\n      * Every year people try this, burn themselves out, and get wrecked in finals\n   * You should assume that you are totally average until 1L grades tell you otherwise  \n\n      * If you’re insecure that you’re not smart enough, you’re probably wrong (chances are you’re average)\n      * If you’re overconfident because you think you’re smarter than everyone else, you’re also probably wrong (chances are you’re average too)\n* You need a plan, and it should be ambitious but reasonable  \n\n   * Plan for problems/interruptions/sickness/distraction\n   * Leave slack in your schedule each week, and across the semester as a whole\n* Each hour of your time becomes more valuable the closer you get to finals  \n\n   * Thus, try to front-load tasks as much as possible without burning out\n\n**Work backwards from the exam**\n\n* The exam is the only thing that matters\n* Repeat: **THE EXAM IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS**  \n\n   * Plan the entire semester based on this realization\n   * Cases are important for learning, but pretty unimportant for the exam  \n\n      * Repeat: they *ARE important*, just not while sitting in the exam\n* So start by figuring out: what does the exam look like?  \n\n   * **NOTE**: Check the format with your professor, on the off-chance that it’s different… but most will be like this:\n   * A series of hypotheticals that you will need to analyze, often w/ little guidance, and write about in a Word doc for the professor (at some schools this may be done via special exam software but the content is the same)\n   * Extreme time pressure\n   * (Usually) open-book, open-note, even open-internet\n   * Blind grading (professor has no idea who you are)  \n\n      * Notably, they also don't know whether you nailed a cold call or bombed it\n   * Cases are used only for their key takeaway/rule, and maybe to analogize the most important facts to the exam hypo  \n\n      * *At most* you might say something like “Necessity is not a defense to murder (*Dudley*), so in this case John wouldn’t be able to raise it.”\n      * Or something like, “The workers here are independent contractors, but unlike the anesthesiologists in *Roessler*, they don’t seem to have apparent authority.”\n      * This kind of unofficial “citation” to a case is not only the maximum you’d have to do, it’s honestly more than most professors would expect or care about – you DO NOT have to even use cases to this degree\n      * The point is, a few days/weeks from now, when you’re spending so much time learning cases, reflect back on these examples in this post, and realize how little information you’ll actually use from them on the exam\n* So, now that you know what the exam involves, what sorts of tools would probably help you during the exam?  \n\n   * A gigantic, well-organized document with all the information from the class, that you can CTRL-F to find things  \n\n      * This is an “outline”\n   * Your raw class notes to CTRL-F in case you missed something  \n\n      * This is why you should take good notes\n   * A shorter document laying out only the most important info as a reminder, that you can glance at quickly mid-exam  \n\n      * This is an “attack outline”\n   * Other visual aids?  \n\n      * An excel database of cases w/ key info?\n      * Flowcharts?\n      * Other creative ideas?\n   * Knowing your professor’s opinions, preferences, quirks\n   * Practice: having done a very similar exam multiple times before  \n\n      * AKA “practice exams”\n   * General familiarity with the content from constant exposure  \n\n      * AKA consistent studying and review all semester\n* What will probably NOT help you during the exam:  \n\n   * Memorization (because it’s open note)\n   * Flashcards\n   * Details of case facts\n   * Full case briefs\n   * In-depth reasoning of majority/dissent\n   * Historical cases that are no longer relevant\n   * Highlighting in your casebook\n   * Rambling about general legal concepts not directly related to hypo\n   * Policy/theory/ethics  \n\n      * UNLESS explicitly asked, or specific prof likes it\n   * The opinions, preferences, quirks of your classmates\n* Thus, **devote more time to developing things that will help and less time to things that won’t help**  \n\n   * Don’t spend time on things just because they feel like “work” (ex. writing out a 2-page analysis of each case you read, making flashcards), or because your classmates are doing it, or older students say to do it, or even because professors say to do it (it’s been probably decades since they were in school)  \n\n      * **This includes not blindly listening to ME either!** Think critically and carefully about each task and consider whether it will really help you come exam time\n      * Solicit suggestions from 2/3Ls, classmates, profs, the internet, and try out their methods…. But be prepared to adapt to your own way, or toss them out\n* I have way more to say about exam nitty-gritty and strategy, but that should wait until much later in the semester  \n\n   * When the time comes, check out my post about [preparing for exams during the final month of the semester](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/dtiy6y/detailed_game_plan_for_finals_for_all_the_anxious/), followed by my post detailing [specific strategies for writing the exam itself once you're sitting in it](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/e7m4uz/for_1ls_a_detailed_guide_on_how_the_hell_you/)\n\n**Taking notes in class**\n\n* By far the most important thing you can do\n* The professor is judge, jury, and executioner of your exam  \n\n   * If you, the book, or supplements ever disagree with the professor, the professor is always right (for the exam anyway)\n   * Many profs will encourage you to challenge their ideas, either in class or in office hours…. But when it comes to the exam, follow what they think\n   * If you get a policy/political question, you may choose to argue a point that your prof disagrees with, if it’s truly a debatable non-settled non-legal question  \n\n      * But when it comes to “how does Torts work” your prof is always correct\n* For most profs, 99.9% of the information you’ll need will come up in class at some point (either from the prof, or from discussion w/ students)  \n\n   * This is part of why devoting too much time to reading/briefing isn’t worth it – you’ll get the info in class\n* Pay attention, take lots of notes, fill any holes either by asking classmates, revisiting the recordings, or going to office hours\n* Take your notes for each subject in one big combined Word doc, NOT separate docs for each class period (ex. all Crim notes in a single doc, not \"Crim August 26th\" and \"Crim August 28th\")\n\n   * Trust me, this will save you enormous time and effort later\n   * You can also use more sophisticated tools like One Note if you know how\n* If you handwrite, you will HAVE to transfer them to electronic form at  some point so you can use them for outlining and during the exam  \n\n   * Probably smart to set up a routine for doing this each week or other similar time period\n* Follow whatever style and format works best for your brain - nothing else matters\n\n**Reading**\n\n* Timing: probably good to get ahead, at least by a couple days  \n\n   * Aspire to finish the semester’s reading early if you can\n   * By reading ahead, you leave room for problems (if you get sick or have some deadline or are burned out, the punishment is being back on normal pace, rather than falling behind)\n   * BUT consider that being too far ahead means you forget details and can mess up cold calls  \n\n      * Probably good to do a quick refresh right before class\n   * Start to track how long it takes to read each page (this may be different for each class)  \n\n      * Not to be a gunner, but so that you can accurately estimate time for each assignment\n      * You *will* get faster as the semester goes on (often significantly faster) - this is part of the normal law school process\n* Read every word carefully the first time through\n* Try really hard to understand what’s going on factually and legally\n* Try to figure out how each judge is making their arguments\n* Practice distilling the key questions:  \n\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, what are the facts?\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, what legal rule comes out of this?\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, what did the dissent say (if any)?\n   * In 1-2 sentences MAX, is there any other context/info from book?\n   * Ex. *R v. Dudley & Stevens*  \n\n      * Facts: “Two guys starving on boat eat third guy”\n      * Law: “Rule: necessity is not a valid defense to murder”\n      * Context: “This is an old English case and American law is a bit different now”\n* Probably smart to write down those super brief, super important summaries in case you get cold called, though it’s not strictly necessary  \n\n   * However….\n\n**Briefing**\n\n* CONTROVERSIAL: should you write down *all* of those facts, details, arguments, and legal minutiae from the reading?  \n\n   * This is called “briefing”\n   * Doing this is part of traditional law school advice, but highly controversial\n   * There seems to be a modern trend away from briefing\n* Briefing pros:  \n\n   * Cold calls are way easier\n   * You never need to revisit the book because it’s all there\n   * Helps some people remember facts/arguments/details better\n   * May force you to understand things better\n* Briefing cons:  \n\n   * Takes an absolutely enormous amount of time\n   * Most of the information is unnecessary outside of cold calls\n   * Will never be used on an actual exam\n   * You can survive a cold call without it\n   * People often become too reliant on them as a crutch\n   * Seriously, an enormous f\\*cking amount of time\n* Some people swear by briefing, including some very successful students\n* But many, including me, think they’re a waste of time  \n\n   * The ratio of time required to value gained is insanely wasteful\n   * They mostly help cold calls… and cold calls have no impact on your grade\n   * Many people study tons of hours and burn out… yet get bad grades?  \n\n      * Too much time spent briefing is often the culprit\n      * Briefing *feels like* you’re being productive and *feels like* you’re “learning” and “being a good law student” and “accomplishing something”… but many people discover come exam time that **those efforts don’t translate into results**\n   * Easy to be too perfectionist or worry about things like formatting, that no one will ever see\n   * Try it, maybe it works for you, but be ready to abandon if necessary\n   * Only do it if  \n\n      * a) you have no other more valuable tasks to do and\n      * b) are totally well-rested, relaxed, and bored and need no rest time\n   * I would much rather spend an hour reading ahead, outlining, doing practice exams (late in the semester), doing career services tasks, taking care of personal errands, making flowcharts, revising my notes, reviewing my notes, etc. than I would an hour of briefing\n   * I would also much rather spend an hour sleeping, partying, watching Netflix, jogging, etc. than an hour briefing, because my energy will recharge and make be more productive at other more important tasks\n* MIDDLE GROUND: “Book Briefing”  \n\n   * Highlight important things\n   * Make notes in the margins\n   * Don’t actually write out a full brief\n   * Many people like this solution\n\n**Outlining**\n\n* Sounds scarier than it is  \n\n   * Literally just compile your notes into one big document, edit it a bit, and format so it’s easy to look stuff up/organize\n   * If you add something to the outline you don’t understand or remember, revisit your notes/book/friends/supplements/professor to figure it out  \n\n      * Eventually you’ll understand everything\n* Use old outlines!  \n\n   * Everyone agrees you shouldn’t just use an old outline straight up (and sometimes profs don’t allow it)\n   * But you don’t necessarily need to take the time to build one from scratch\n   * Either take an old one and modify it to your liking, or build your own but use the old ones as a reference to save time and make sure you don’t screw up\n   * Many schools have an outline bank\n   * Many student orgs have outline banks\n   * Your PAs should provide old outlines, as will student org mentors (ask them!)  \n\n      * Unless your school doesn't have PAs or mentors, of course\n* It’s an iterative process – the outline is never “done”  \n\n   * You want to compile the information in a way that is both comprehensive and easy to navigate in your brain  \n\n      * Remember that you’ll be flipping through or CTRL-Fing it urgently to look up something during an exam\n      * Information recall speed and organization are key\n* It’s also a critical learning experience as you fit all the conceptual pieces together in your head and organize them in ways your brain understands  \n\n   * This is the main reason relying solely on old outlines is a problem\n* Ideally you should add to your outlines bit by bit as the semester goes on  \n\n   * BUT note that you will not be capable of doing much of the connective intellectual work until the end of the semester when you’ve seen enough of the class to understand how things fit\n* An “attack outline” is literally just your outline, but slimmed down so it’s faster to look stuff up\n\n**Practice Exams**\n\n* Don’t worry about this until like, November\n* But once you get to the last few weeks, and certainly reading period and finals, these will be critically important\n* Most profs will give you old exams, though some wait until late in the semester  \n\n   * If not, ask\n   * If you can’t get them, try to find exams from other profs, or the internet\n   * DON’T ask a 2/3L for them, because schools tend to get very touchy about it and you don't want to get the 2/3L (or yourself) in trouble\n* You really really really need to get hands on practice applying your knowledge and resources to hypos\n* You WILL feel panicked the first time you’re staring at a hypo and a blank page but you’ll figure it out  \n\n   * You want to work through this experience on a practice, not the real thing\n\n**Think outside the box**\n\n* That’s basically it for traditional law school study techniques, but feel free to experiment\n* I personally started using Excel spreadsheets and found them ultra useful - [here's an example](https://www.reddit.com/user/Oldersupersplitter/comments/iiuucb/excel_cases_outline_example/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n   * Each case (including the minor note cases) gets a line with the name, year, the topic, a few words of facts, and a very brief overview of why it matters\n   * I can see the entire possible body of law for each topic on a single screen\n   * You start to notice trends and connections differently than in Word\n* Flowcharts  \n\n   * I love flowcharts, and as a 2L used flowcharts almost exclusively during the actual exams (with other traditional tools available if needed) - here is [a link with some examples](https://www.reddit.com/user/Oldersupersplitter/comments/idkyr8/flowchart_examples/)\n   * There are white boards in many library study rooms\n   * I’ve now moved to the [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) website and find it easier to do electronically\n\n**Structuring your semester, revisited**\n\n* Now that we know what everything is….\n* Your #1 job is staying on top of the readings and class notes  \n\n   * Preferably staying slightly ahead on reading\n   * At the start, this is really your only goal\n* Review/revisit material periodically to refresh it and find connections  \n\n   * Some people do this at the end of each week, every couple weeks, etc\n* Talk to your classmates, talk to profs in office hours, try to learn wtf is going on\n* Look for old outlines day one, and refer to them as needed even before making your own\n* Start building your outlines and/or modifying old ones  \n\n   * Some people add a little each week, others only after 4-6 weeks, some at the end\n   * No correct answer, but certainly it’s good to at least start by November 1 if you can\n* In the second half of the semester, the focus shifts more and more from reading into outlining\n* In the final month, 90% of your time should be spent on outlining, practice exams, and filling in holes in your understanding  \n\n   * Those last two are more important than outlines, which is why it’s good to aim for progress on outlines early\n* Plan out the days you’ll prepare for each final, way before you need to  \n\n   * I like to give myself 30 days before the first final: one week per class, then two days at the end to cram before the first final\n   * Then, as soon as you take a final, forget everything and spend all of your time prepping for the next one, and so on until you’re done\n   * Plan to be ultra burned out after each final  \n\n      * If you can study, great\n      * But you will almost certainly not have the mental or emotional capacity to  study until the next day, maybe that evening at best, so don’t rely on that time when you’re planning\n\n**Study groups**\n\n* Can be incredible helpful\n* Can also be a huge distraction\n* Very very important for reviewing practice exams at the very end\n* Probably worth trying them, at least with one other student to bounce things off of\n* Be extremely cautious about wasting time  \n\n   * Your classmates are probably cool and interesting, and if you become besties, you might spend all your time chatting and enjoying each other’s company instead of studying\n   * It’s good to have a concrete game plan for each study session - save the socializing for when you go to the bar *after* an efficient and productive study session (both the studying and the drinking will be improved this way)\n   * Later in the semester, you can even calendar specific things to cover on specific days\n* Don’t be afraid to include people from the other section(s) that share your professors!\n\n**Productivity in general**\n\n* There are many common suggestions and tips for productivity that I won’t write about for pages and pages here because you can look them online or in books (and by getting to this point, you’re probably respectably productive anyway)  \n\n   * However, here are some law school-specific thoughts that I have based on not only my own experience, but also the experiences of my 3L friends and the 1Ls I’ve mentored...\n* ***If you tell me you “studied 10 hours in the library….”***\n* First, law students love to exaggerate these things (so don’t freak out when your classmates mention stuff like this), but let’s assume you actually did 10 hours\n* Second, how much time during those 10 hours were you ACTUALLY studying?  \n\n   * Many many many people, myself included, will go to the library or their desk at home to “study” but find themselves constantly distracted by the obvious things (facebook, games, online shopping, news, etc) but also  less obvious things:  \n\n      * Talking to friends/study group about stuff that is not relevant to class\n      * Getting into deep philosophical arguments about legal theory that will make a great paper someday but have nothing to do with 1L exams\n      * Thinking about all the money you’ll make in BigLaw\n      * Thinking about how you’re going to save the world in PI\n      * Reading some interesting but irrelevant legal tangent because you don’t want to look at Torts any more that day\n      * Listening to friends in other sections talk about how *their* Contracts class is going\n      * Picking out the exact right shade of highlighter for highlighting today’s notes\n      * And so on…\n   * Sometimes you know that you’re not being productive if it’s Instagram, but many of these things I listed above might *feel like* you’re productive because they’re “about the law” or at least “law adjacent”  \n\n      * And hey, many of these things are great and valuable and you should do  them…. But don’t count them as “study time” in your schedule or your  head, because you will fool yourself into thinking you put in more hours  than you did\n      * Instead, use your study time to *actually study* and then spend the same amount of time doing all that other stuff I listed but block it out during a *separate time* in the day\n      * You may end up with MORE time to do these things that interest you because you power through the real studying all at once, and then feel free to go on tangents and socialize to your hearts content without being  chained to the library desk\n* Third, when you really truly are “studying,” what **specifically** does that mean and is it the most effective task at this moment?  \n\n   * This basically plays into everything I described about study habits above\n   * There  are lots of tasks that do technically count as studying, and hey maybe you do them for 4 straight hours without talking to anyone or checking  facebook…. But they don’t actually help you for the exam (or only help a  little bit)\n   * Here is where briefing really ruins a lot of people, in my opinion\n   * What are some other examples of tasks I’ve heard of classmates doing that waste time (or that I’ve done myself and realized my mistake)?  \n\n      * Re-reading the case multiple times after already discussing it in class (just revisit your notes at that point)\n      * Reading parts of the textbook that aren’t in the syllabus\n      * Reading supplements for topics that aren’t in the syllabus\n      * Memorizing facts (unless you get the rare closed book exam)\n      * Making flashcards (same thing)\n      * Looking up the history around an area of law, or the voluminous academic  scholarship around it (probably interesting, maybe valuable in the grand  sense for your education, but do it in “non-study” time because it has  no bearing on the exam unless the prof says it does or you’re very  confident it will come up)\n      * Briefing (in my opinion)\n* **IF** you only spend your study time doing **effective, high-value tasks** (*assigned*  reading, outlining, practice exams, reviewing notes, making visual aids  for the exam, finding explanations to topics you don’t understand,  filling in holes in your notes) and you also spend your “study time” **actually studying** without distraction  \n\n   * You will find that **the number of hours required to prepare thoroughly and get good grades is** **much smaller than you’d think**, and much smaller than the amount of time most students “study”\n   * This  is how some people “magically” get good grades while also going to Bar  Review, maintaining a relationship, playing video games, taking weekends  off, etc.  \n\n      * And, because they have left so many hours each day/week to rest and relax, their brains are in a better position to perform well when it comes to  study or take the exam!!\n* Of course, **I guarantee you will be nowhere near perfect** at this at the start, or even by the end of the first semester  \n\n   * But you should aspire toward efficiency and constantly ask yourself, *for you and the way YOU study effectively*, “am I actually studying during study time?” and “are my study tasks effective & efficient?”",

    "text": "Out of all the cases you've read so far, which one(s) pissed you off the most, and why? &nbsp;Have y'all ever read a case that boils your blood and ruins your day even just thinking about it? We all have those specific decisions that make us feel some kind of way, and I'd love to know which ones have affected you the most. I can't tell you how many times so-called jurisprudence made my jaw drop by irrationally legitimizing some serious bullshit. This might sound silly, but sometimes I'll get seriously pissed off thinking about judges who've a mockery of the law by perverting the very institution protecting our rights into promulgating injustices. Here's my list of the some of the cases I consider to be among the most egregious examples of this. Let's get the most obvious one out of the way. You already know which one it is without me even having to say it:\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n***Dred Scott v. Sandford.*** Universally regarded as the worst Supreme Court decision of all time, and rightfully so. The ghost of Roger Taney can catch these fucking hands any day of the week. The institution of American chattel slavery was an abomination to both God and mankind, a crime so unbelievably heinous that even those who tacitly endorse it are profoundly evil. But a man who abuses his immense power attempting to perpetuate that horror forever, well, he's cast himself down to the very bottom of the lowest circle of hell and started digging. Not only did it deprive African Americans of the basic rights even the racist Founding Fathers allowed them, it became a catalyst for the bloodiest war in our country's history. This smug piece of shit, believing he'd settled the slavery question forever, wrote words that killed hundreds of thousands of people and dehumanized even more.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n Yet **even someone who'd actually agree with dooming an entire race to lacking any rights whatsoever** couldn't even justify effectuating it the way the Court did, because this unbelievable asshole not only wrote his opinion *after* dismissing Scott's claim on standing grounds, he also attached a completely unrelated coda invalidating the Missouri Compromise when he had absolutely no authority to do so. Anyone with even cursory knowledge of the law can see his violation of the separation of powers in effectively legislating from the bench. The Chief Justice is supposed to be the brightest legal mind we have, so that bastard knew exactly what he was doing. His disgusting attack on the Compromise was, in effect, an advisory opinion masquerading as \"jurisprudence\" comparable to a five-year-old's crayon drawing of a swastika. Even worse, six other Justices participated in this gang-rape of the very rights our country was founded on. It was not only substantively unjust but procedurally unjust as well. The only two men with any sort of backbone in this story are Dred Scott himself and Justice Robbins (the only Supreme Court justice to resign on principle.) The rest of them deserve to burn (and yes, that includes McLean too).  \n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***McClesky v. Kemp.*** What do you get when you combine racism, injustice, and denial of not only factual proof but basic mathematics itself? You get an extraordinarily tragic and infuriating example of how courts have continued to deprive African Americans of their voice in the judicial process even almost a century and a half after the Dred Scott decision. The abolition of the pre-Furman framework for capital punishment was in large part due to systematic racial disparities in the imposition of death sentences. Our current post-Gregg framework, in contrast, was partly born from Georgia's desire to absolutely kill the shit out of Troy Gregg, as one of five states providing a template for the reintroduction of capital punishment. To do so, they convoluted their process in a way that addressed every concern in *Furman* to comply with the Eighth Amendment, and quickly extinguished any other lingering constitutional issues (e.g. Coker v. Georgia). This case directly exposed the post-Gregg framework as the charade it always was; a continuation of the policy of certain death for black defendants alleged to have committed **any** sort of crime against a white victim. \n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disparity was always odious and obvious; black men accused of raping white women were almost always executed, with very few exceptions, if they even had the chance to make it the gallows before they were lynched by a mob. In contrast, the execution of white defendants for rape was very rare, and almost all of these cases involved defendants convicted of raping a child. McClesky's thorough, comprehensive, scientific analysis of every single Georgia death sentence statistically proved that black defendants accused of killing white victims were **TWENTY-TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE A DEATH SENTENCE THAN BLACK DEFENDANTS ACCUSED OF KILLING BLACK VICTIMS**, and more than seven times more likely to be sentenced to death than white defendants convicted of killing a black victim. The denial of such empirical and objective data can't be adequately explained by anything other than the majority advocating, or at the very least actively condoning systematic racism. \n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nThis alone is already unconscionable from the highest court in the land, but the most egregious part of this case is Powell's inexplicable and unconstitutional assertion that **even if Georgia's sentencing policy being racist were taken as true** (remember, their pledged avoidance of this was the whole basis they were allowed to bring it back)  McClesky had no recourse because no racial bias could be proven **in his specific case.** I can't even explain how wrong that is, on so many different grounds. The granting of rights to everyone through the granting of rights to an individual plaintiff has long been one of the most basic cornerstones of judicial function, and denying that to McClesky was, in effect,  a denial of rights to all African Americans, and it killed him. Even Powell himself admitted years later that he wished he could go back and change his vote. Unfortunately, McClesky had already been executed by then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***Ashcroft v. Iqbal.*** This is an example of a recent case that makes scholars throw up their hands and go, \"yeah, I get it, but... come on, seriously?\". It's the legal equivalent of what happens when an unstoppable force (Iqbal's claims) meets an immovable object (the US government's storied commitment to covering its own ass when committing human rights abuses.) The extraordinary lengths the government went to in order fuck over just one guy over were so extensive that they irreversibly changed the way the ENTIRE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM WORKS, FOR EVERYONE, disadvantaging every single civil plaintiff in the the past thirteen years, just to deny this one guy his basic rights. The Court's complete disregard for the well-settled logic behind the doctrine of respondeat superior and vicarious liability is already bad enough, but its extraordinary far-reaching consequences for civil procedure have irreparably harmed the whole idea of what litigation actually exists for, and will most likely continue to do so for a very long time. \n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis completely unwarranted, arbitrary imposition of the plausibility standard infected a mostly-objective process with an extremely dangerous element of subjectiveness. Who's to say what's actually \"plausible\"? The previous framework was imperfect but far more just: claims were dismissed immediately if they were obviously factually impossible, vexatious, malicious, 12(b)(6)'d, or otherwise unacceptable for litigation. these standards are not only very clear, but necessarily mostly or completely dependent upon consideration of objective facts. Plausible? I'll tell you what's fucking plausible. It's plausible that the Supreme Court secretly conspired with the executive branch to change the way the whole game is played, just to excuse its abuse and arbitrary detention of Arab Muslims in the aftermath of 9/11. It's plausible that they were looking for the a perfect test case to come along and serve as the excuse to introduce this plausibility standard, and this one just happened to be the right fit. And it's *extremely* plausible that everyone responsible for this decision can suck my nuts, because the last thing on Earth I ever needed as a manic 1L was a few dozen more pages of Civil Procedure reading than I otherwise wouldn't have had. Thanks a lot!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***Bank Markazi v. Peterson.*** Iran, Iran, Iran. How many times have we seen the incredible lengths our judiciary has gone to in order to break the fundamental rules of our own laws? They love to carve convenient exceptions out of the very concept of what laws and precedents mean, just to get back at them for the 1979 hostage crisis. That's the only explanation for all these similar rulings involving Iran -- far too many to list here -- that completely defy any logical justification and contradict everything the separation of powers stands for. The prohibition on legislative meddling in the specific outcomes of individual cases is, and always has been, one of the most important protections of the separation of powers, without which judicial power becomes completely meaningless, I mean like seriously  on some pre-Marbury shit, so it's one of the most important safeguards we have against violating that separation. Allowing the legislature to influence cases this way is downright incestuous, a distant and obviously legally different kissing cousin to the idea behind double jeopardy as well, if the legislature truly wants to play house like that and act as a quasi-judiciary (although not everyone would agree with this comparison, I know that's kind of a stretch.) \n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe judiciary means absolutely nothing without the absolute assurance of its finality. The judiciary interprets the legislature, and allowing the legislature to have any control at all over a pending judicial action would in effect allow the legislature to interpret itself. I don't have to expound on how dangerous that is. Justifying this decision on the argument that this law is acceptable because it applies only to a specific pending trial rather than its outcome, or other unrelated trials, and only eliminates all of one party's defenses rather than deciding their fate entirely, has the ultimate effect of arbitrarily giving Iran a snowball's chance in hell of exercising the same rights any other defendant would have. It's the legal equivalent of a boxing match where one of the fighters has both of his hands tied behind his back. Not only was this decision an egregious denial of due process to one defendant under a certain docket number, this was done with FIFTEEN OTHER DOCKET NUMBERS. I know they're still salty about the hostage crisis, but opening up a portal between two sources of power designed to be eternally immiscible creates the possibility of applying it to cases involving Americans as well, or really, anyone. The fact that Justice Ginsburg, of all people, wrote the majority opinion is shocking to say the least.\n\nAnyway, what cases have pissed you off the most, and why?",

We do not use our positions to advance our individual views. But we do have an obligation to support the rule of law and preserve the integrity of the legal profession. On rare occasions, despite our differing situations and views, that obligation requires us to speak as one to defend the fundamental commitments of our profession. This is such a moment.\n\nThe violent attack on the Capitol was an assault on our democracy and the rule of law. The effort to disrupt the certification of a free and fair election was a betrayal of the core values that undergird our Constitution. Lives were lost, the seat of our democracy was desecrated, and our country was shamed.\n\nMany lawyers and judges worked honestly and in good faith, often in the face of considerable political pressure, to ensure the 2020 election was free and fair. However, we recognize with dismay and sorrow that some lawyers challenged the outcome of the election with claims that they did not support with facts or evidence. This betrayed the values of our profession. Our profession demands that when lawyers pursue legal action, they must bring claims in good faith, grounded in facts and evidence, and demonstrate respect for the legal system. Only then can lawyers fulfill their responsibilities as lawyers and public citizens to promote public confidence in the rule of law and the justice system — duties that extend to all professional activities, whether lawyers are representing a client or not. The rule of law is as much a touchstone of our profession as it is of our Constitution.\n\nAs law deans, our mission is to train the next generation of leaders to uphold the core values of our profession and sustain the rule of law. This should be a moment of reflection for legal educators and members of the legal profession. A sustained effort will be necessary to repair and preserve our precious democratic institutions. As legal educators and lawyers ourselves, we must redouble our efforts to restore faith in the rule of law and the ideals of the legal profession. We have enormous faith in the law’s enduring values and in our students, who will soon lead this profession. We call upon all members of the legal profession to join us in the vital work ahead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSigned,\n\n^(Alicia Ouellette President and Dean Albany Law School)\n\n^(Robert Dinerstein Acting Dean and Professor of Law American University, Washington College of Law)\n\n^(Jace C.

    "text": "I wish there wasn’t always better a while ago I searched up “beautiful Africans Quora” and saw questions like “why are East Africans women so beautiful” and “why do East African women look so different?” I was confused bc I didn’t know this was a thing?? Like I knew of colorism and mixed black women (especially when ambiguous looking) commonly being seen as more attractive than darker black women, but East African preference was new to me as someone who has never really lived around East Africans. \n\nI searched up what East Africans looked like and yeah, it made sense. They have the smaller noses, smaller lips, soft wavy hair, etc, all the features not commonly associated with the rest of Africa / slave descendant black Americans (who are primarily from west Africa). \n\nI looked into it and found out that bc of the region’s isolationism throughout the centuries, there is a lot less physical diversity than in other regions of Africa. So that’s why it’s not rare to see a west African or black American w/ a small nose but it is rare to see an East African w/ a big nose. \n\nAnyways i know I shouldn’t have, but I kept  looking and y’all I was so exhausted. There are so many questions on Quora / Reddit about East Africans’ “exotic” look and beauty compared to “regular” black people, like I know I should’ve expected it cus ofc Eurocentric features on dark skin will always be seen as more attractive than Afro centric feature on dark skin, but still it just hurt bc it feels like there’s always another group that’s perceived as better. \n\nRappers like drake talk about East Africans a lot in their music too which is especially frustrating bc it’s like they try to pass it off as black girl appreciation, while only ever praising one specific subset of black people who’a features commonly fit into European beauty standards.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way? This isn’t hate towards any East Africans or an attempt to undermine their beauty, it’s obviously not their fault that society is like this, it’s more just a rant about how even within the black community, there’s still a hierarchy based on how Eurocentric ur features are. I just wish beauty wasn’t judged through a white lens \n\n\nEdit: my intent is definitely not to incite drama, it’s just something that’s been hurting me for a while but if it is breaking the rules, I’ll definitely take it down",

    "text": "Dear Postgraduate Black Americans studying in the UK: ©️world2021 \n\nDear Postgraduate Black Americans studying in the UK: \n\n**THE BAD**\nYou will be the only one if you're in the arts/humanities at postgraduate level and chose your supervisor for their expertise (as you should) rather than choosing to be in London or Manchester to be surrounded by other black people. \n\n**THE NEUTRAL**\nYou are probably currently residing amongst a lot of Chinese postgrads if you're in halls. They may or may not be open to you. \n\n**THE GOOD**\nThis is an opportunity to get to know a more diverse set group of people than you've (probably) previously mixed with socially. Embrace that. \n\n**THE BRITISH**\nPeople like to think of themselves as tolerant, fair and most definitely not racist. You will judge for yourself the extent to which that's true or not, but that's how people tend to think. You will at times encounter ignorance, especially if absolutely everyone is white, but it's highly unlikely to be the case within a university. Where you do encounter ignorance, most people will be open to discussion in the right setting. They will be horrified to know they've caused unintended offence. (No that doesn't necessarily make it ok.) \n\nNow for some advice. Note, you will almost always be understood regardless of what you say, so some of the later language advice is simply to avoid inadvertently irritating us. \n\n**MEETING & COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER PEOPLE** - THE DOS \n\n+ Be open to everyone. \n\n+ Take people as you find them, not as you expect to find them. \n\n+ Always join your colleagues when invited to the pub. (Until such time as you decide that you definitely, 100% cannot stand them, if that happens) \n\n+ Go to fresher's week. Join clubs and societies around activities that interest you. *This will probably be you best source of friendship.* \n\n+ Visit every museum you can - they're mostly free \n\n+ Take advantage of student discounts, especially for cultural activities like live theatre. Ask the Student Union for more info. \n\n+ Visit other parts of the UK (there will be discounted tours-again you'll find organisers in Fresher's Week). \n\n+ Visit Europe for more than a day's shopping trip. North Africa is also close and relatively inexpensive. \n\n+ Join a religious community if that's important to you. \n\n+ Try to be specific in your use of language. E.g. *I'm from the South*...of...? Texas? The States? Scotland? England? London? Cornwall? \n\n+ Mind your Ps & Qs (🔍) - always, always say thank you. It is not necessary to respond to a thank you. \n\n+ Learn how we use the terms race and especially [ethnicity here](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/ ) \n\n+ Watch *Question Time* and *Newsnight* on BBC2 or iplayer to get a better understanding of British politics, especially the views of the 'left' and 'right' which you may find surprising as the terms do not correlate with American usage. Or don't. \n\n+ Look for opportunities to contribute - for example, by volunteering as a mentor in a local school. Black arts and humanities academics are rare. Be the change you want to see. Or don't. \n\n**MEETING & COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER PEOPLE** - THE DON’TS \n\n+ Don't take offence to any of the following if it doesn’t apply to you. This has taken a long time to compile, is based on experience of black Americans in British universities, and I'm only trying to help you. \n\n+ Do not generalise and say *Britain/the UK is like x* or *British people are like y* if you've only been to whatever part of it you're in. You'll offend. (See, be specific above) \n\n+ Do not say that you go to school. You go to university or uni. Only children go to school. \n\n+ Do not exclude anyone as a potential friend on the grounds of race, religion or sexuality. \n\n+ Do not assume that mixed-race people identify as black. They may and they may not. \n\n+ Do not assume that others share your religious beliefs, if you have any. Most Brits (Europeans) are irreligious and secular; even most who describe themselves as 'Christian' often merely mean that they were baptised as an infant or that they're white or that they're *not* a Muslim or Hindu. \n\n+ Do not fear: Muslims (potential friends and allies), terrorism (that would just be unpreventable very, very bad luck) or knife crime (no one is looking for you). \n\n**MEETING OTHER BLACK PEOPLE** \n\n+ Join the ACS (Afro-Caribbean society) to meet fellow black students. \n\n+ Go to uni club nights that play your sort of music if that's your thing. (Prob Thursdays if you like Afrobeats, R&B etc. Don't expect it to be majority black though). \n\n+ Use meetup.com to find black locals who want to mingle. Unless you're in the countryside, there probably *are* ethnic minorities where you live but they are not likely to live anywhere near your university. \n\n+ Go to the pub (the repetition is deliberate). Drink alcohol; don't drink alcohol. But whatever you drink, go. \n\nWelcome and enjoy!",

    "text": "Katty Perry kisses a boy in the lips without consent, no-one cares about the boy thoughts. I saw this post in Quora, with 164k upvotes, and it really gave me faith in men's rights. Credits to Zee Hamid - Quora.  \n\nReally worth the read. \n\n\n\"A teen girl tells an older man in power she has never been kissed. “I want it to be meaningful and am saving it for a real relationship,” she adds. \n\nShe is from a conservative family and the first kiss carries a lot of significance for her. \n\nThe man ignores it and puts the girl in an uncomfortable position by asking for a kiss. The girl, pressured, goes to kiss the cheek but the man turns his face last second to kiss her on the lip without her consent. \n\nThe girl, shocked, literally falls back to the ground. The man laughs. \n\n**Sorry, I mixed up genders.**\n\nThis 19-year-old American Idol contestant, Benjamin Glaze, comes from a conservative family. He tells judges he has never had a kiss because he is saving it for the first meaningful relationship. \n\nBenjamin Glaze actually has a girlfriend, but he doesn’t feel it’s a real enough relationship yet, and he has chosen to wait. \n\n“I have never been in a relationship and I can’t kiss a girl without being in a relationship.” \n\nThat should’ve been the end of it, but Katy Perry calls him up for a kiss. \n\nHe is obviously uncomfortable. He hesitantly comes up. \n\n“On the cheek?” \n\nHe uncomfortably kisses her on the cheek and she mocks him saying it was not a real kiss. She asks for another. \n\nAnd as he goes up, she turns her face to kiss him on the lip after he has explicitly told her that he does not want to be kissed unless he is in a relationship. \n\nDo other judges call her out? Hell no. They laugh and she cheers. \n\nRecap:\n\nThe contestant has just been sexually assaulted. His boundaries were violated. His wishes were ignored. He was tricked into kissing when he explicitly said he wasn’t ready. His consent wasn’t taken.\n\nAnd people laughed like it was a joke.\n\nNot understanding or respecting people’s boundaries, and not seeking consent, is what’s wrong with society today. Laughing about it, esp. when it’s something that happens to a man, makes it worse. Sexual assault isn’t a problem when it happens to women, it’s a problem when it happens to anyone (male, female, trans, whoever).\"\n\nOriginal post (with pictures): https://www.quora.com/What-is-wrong-with-our-society-today/answer/Zee-Hamid-2?ch=10&oid=76417423&share=55b4f509&srid=h5l9iu&target_type=answer",

    "text": "(STUDIES SHOW) Domestic violence against women was condemned and illegal way before the 1970s. Back then, they were some of the most hated people on Earth whereas domestic violence against men was tolerated back then. This idea it wasn't condemned until the 1970s is a myth. [https://web.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/law-culture/files/2010-files/Katz\\_Workshop\\_Paper.pdf](https://web.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/law-culture/files/2010-files/Katz_Workshop_Paper.pdf)\n\n[https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1404&context=wmjowl&httpsredir=1&referer=](https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1404&context=wmjowl&httpsredir=1&referer=)\n\nMany people, including historians, believe this myth that until the 1970s, domestic violence was tolerated and police did nothing about it. These research papers debunk this myth, showing overwhelmingly large amounts of evidence that the opposite is true. People took domestic violence far more seriously than they do nowadays. Back then, however, the word domestic violence was not commonly used. Instead, people just said \"wife beating\" or \"wife beater\". People back then advocated whipping posts for wife beaters and people wanted you killed even if you beat your wife only once (imagine if Chris Brown beat Rihanna back then!). A couple of states, such as Maryland, Delware, and Oregon, had whipping posts, and public opinion approved of murder vigilantism and whipping posts against wife beaters. Vigilantism also happened every now and then (which is rare nowadays). Telling someone back then you're a wifebeater is like telling someone today that you're a child molester.\n\n**But guess what?**\n\nWomen who beat their husbands were relatively tolerated. Although many people hated women who beat their husband, many people didn't care about what they did. Women who beat their husbands were used in popular culture for humor-related purposes and people made jokes about it. Judges were also far more lenient on women who beat husbands, with some judges even outright praising them. Here's a quote:\n\n>It is striking that judges condoned wives’ use of physical punishment when they found their husbands drunk. One judge declared in open court, “\\[a\\]ny wife has my official permission to beat her husband with any weapon she chooses if the man comes home drunk late at night.” In a similar type of case, a “young and pretty” wife explained to a judge in Kansas that she had given her husband a severe beating because he had broken her rule that he must be home each night by 9:00 P.M. “You are a good woman,” the judge told the wife, “and I want to compliment you for taking the law into your own hands. We ought to have more women like you.” The judge discharged her immediately but only agreed to discharge her husband after he promised to return home before his wife’s curfew.  \n>  \n>Outside courtrooms, a similar understanding seems to have existed. A news brief in one paper summarized: “\\[a\\]n Indiana woman is to get a medal for beating her husband. While admittedly the best in the world, the American husband evidently needs toning down occasionally.” Legislators debating appropriate punishments for hus- band beating in New Jersey thought “it would be a splendid thing if there were more women who were willing and able to chastise worthless husbands properly.” Even a man whose “husky” wife “sent him down for the count and an ambulance surgeon” after attacking him in his sleep was reported as acknowledging the appropriate- ness of his wife’s assault. He told the police, “I guess she was right. But I’m surprised at her for using the stove lifter, just the same.”\n\nMale victims of domestic violence were never taken seriously. Judges \"harshly condemned male perpetrators—sentencing men to fines, prison, and even the whipping post—for failing to conform to appropriate husbandly behavior, while rewarding wives who exhibited the traditional female traits of vulnerability and dependence. Based on the same gendered reasoning, judges trivialized or even ridiculed victims of 'husband beating.' Men who sought protection against physically abusive wives were deemed unmanly and undeserving of the legal remedies afforded to women.\"\n\nMale victims were often seen as \"weak\" or \"unmanly\" for being victimized by a woman, and they were mocked, ridiculed, stigmatized and overlooked. Although small men who were attacked by bigger wives still received ridicule and lack of sympathy, men who were attacked by smaller wives were even more ridiculed. Many newspapers would point out the physical disparity between the two to emphasize this, while refusing to point out physical disparities when a husband beat his wife. Many times when women beat their husbands, crowds would be amused and would watch and observe or even applaud instead of intervening. If people knew about a husband beating his wife, he'd be either reported or arrested or become the victim of a vigilante mob, being attacked or even killed.\n\nAlthough battered women's shelters didn't exist until the early 1970s, people still took domestic violence against women far more serious a century ago than they do nowadays. Being a male victim of domestic violence is stigmatized and difficult today, but was way worse back then.\n\nJudges were far more lenient towards women who beat their husbands. Women who beat their husbands were never put on the whipping post or attacked by vigilantes/judges. A man could just beat his wife only once (without severe injuries) and people back then already wanted him dead. Just imagine if Chris Brown beat Rihanna back then.",

    "text": "Are men systematically discriminated against in child custody disputes? I'm not a Men's Rights Activist, or even a man, but I do care about equality for everyone. I'm here because I want to learn about your perspective, I hope that's okay. While reading posts on this subreddit, I noticed some common beliefs that I want to challenge. This post was supposed to be about several topics, but it ended up longer than anticipated, so I will start with the belief that men are systematically discriminated against in child custody disputes, and maybe make additional posts if this is well received.\n\n---\n\nIt's true that many more women have sole-custody of children compared to men. That's a strong indication that something is wrong somewhere, but it doesn't necessarily mean that men are being discriminated against. The vast majority of custody arrangements are agreed without the involvement of courts. That in itself doesn't rebut the theory of discrimination, but it opens the door to the alternative that fewer men want sole or primary custody of their children because of gender norms.\n\nOne study ([Harding, Maebh and Newnham, Annika (2015) How do county courts share the care of children between parents?](https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/67826/)) looks at the success rate of men and women in child custody disputes. It's an analysis of 197 case files from 5 county courts in England and Wales. It's not peer-reviewed, have a tiny sample size, and I can't make sense of the numbers, but let's look at it anyway as it's the only thing we have available. On page 64 we can read that:\n> Of the 32 applications for a sole residence order by fathers, 16 ended in a sole residence order: a success rate of 50%. 8 ended in shared residence, 5 in contact and 3 ended with no order.\n\nThe next page tells us this about the applications of mothers:\n> There were 30 applications by mothers for sole residence; 19 ended in a sole residence order. This success rate of 63% was slightly higher than the fathers’; something which is consistent with other studies.\n\n> 4 of the remaining 11 applications ended in shared residence orders, 3 in contact orders, 2 in prohibited steps orders which gave the mothers the security they wanted and 2 in no order.\n\n> There were also 3 applications for either residence or contact, 2 ended in a contact order and 1 was withdrawn.\n\nThe reference to \"other studies\" has this footnote referencing a study I cannot access:\n> Where mothers applied for residence, 47% gained either sole or shared residence; the corresponding figure for fathers was a slightly lower 43%. C Smart and others, Residence and Contact Disputes in Court: Volume 1 (University of Leeds 2003) p16\n\nThat's with a sample size of 203 according to the [answer to a parliamentary question in the UK House of Commons](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080402/text/80402w0043.htm).\n\nThis makes it look like men are discriminated against (if we insist on trying to use this very limited data), but we also need to consider the different circumstances under which mothers and fathers applied to the court. The residence applications submitted by mothers were usually made to ask the court to enforce the status-quo. The child was already living permanently with the mother, and she filed an application to keep it that way. Fathers typically applied to change the status-quo and asked the court to intervene to move the child from the mother to the father.\n\nThe courts were reluctant to change the status-quo, but when they did, it was almost always to the benefit of the father (see the figure on page 73). 20 of the 23 cases where the court ordered the child to be moved started with the child living with their mother (2 shared, 1 father). 17 ended up with the child living with their father (2 shared, 2 unclear, 1 mother, and 1 grandparents). Only in one case was a child moved from the father to the mother. It may seem like the figure on the next page contradicts this narrative, but it should be noted that only 17 of the included cases involve applications for residence orders, most of the rest will be for contact orders where residence is agreed.\n\nThe authors say the study \"concludes that the County courts showed no indication of gender bias in contested cases about where the child should live\" (page 56). I don't think we can conclude anything from this study, but it's still the best evidence available as far as I know. If you know of another study, please let me know!\n\nDo we have better evidence for the alternative theory that fewer men want sole or primary custody of their children because of gender norms? Fathers in the US report spending [half as much time on child care compared to mothers](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/). It may be reasonable to assume that people who care less about children also spend less time caring for them, but there may be other explanations. The same article mentions that more fathers compared to mothers feel they are spending too little time with their children because of work obligations. This may be influenced by discriminatory policies, making it more difficult for men to get time off work to care for their children.\n\nAnother explanation that I had not considered before reading the above article is that men apparently are much less confident in their parenting abilities:\n> Just 39% of fathers said in 2015 that they were doing a “very good job” raising their children, compared with 51% of mothers.\n\nThat's a huge difference and likely plays a role in men's willingness to fight for custody. A good parent does what they believe is best for their children. If they don't think they are doing a good job raising their children, they will be much less likely to fight to continue raising them. I could imagine several reasons men would be less likely to feel good about their parenting abilities: lack of support (exclusion from 'mom groups'), difference in depictions of moms and dads in media, etc.\n\nFathers are apparently not the only once who think fathers are less good at parenting. The same article says:\n> About half of Americans (53%) in 2016 said that, breast-feeding aside, mothers do a better job than fathers caring for a new baby. A somewhat smaller share (45%) said mothers and fathers do about equally well, and 1% of Americans said fathers do a better job than mothers.\n\nThat's an extreme gap, 53% vs 1%, and may well influence fathers' decision on whether to seek custody, mothers' decision on whether to oppose it, and yes, judges' decision on how they should rule in a dispute.\n\nSo, what's the conclusion? Unless somebody has a study examining the issue that I have been unable to find, I think we can only conclude that we don't know. Perhaps, family courts are biased against men, but I don't think there is enough evidence to justify that conclusion.",

    "text": "Motherhood as a conservative oppressive ideology used to keep women under control I am currently running a Kickstarter campaign to finance the publication of my photo book \"Undo Motherhood\". It explores the reasons why a significant number of women around the world today regret becoming mothers and points a finger at the patriarchal institution of motherhood, which from a very young age pushes women to become mothers, promising the utmost fulfilment and happiness, and then abandons them, very often at the cost of their lives.  \n\nThe women in this project come from seven different countries. They all love their children and are excellent mothers when judged according to society’s standards, and yet they hate the oppressive mother role that robbed them of their own existence and suffer through it in silence, feeling it to be the worst mistake they have made.\n\nAs a mother myself, I totally agree with the American writer and feminist of the 70s Adrienne Rich. She said that as much as motherhood means a love-based bond with your child, it is at the same time a conservative oppressive ideology with its rigid codex of moral rules that prescribe how you must feel, think, and behave as a mother. In my opinion, it is a perfect invisible and often internalized mechanism to keep women under control in care-giving subservient roles.\n\nWith this project I hope to help other people to make informed decisions and contribute to the public discussion about gender roles and power structures in families and society.\n\nIf you would like to support the campaign, please check out the link: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/933301382/undo-motherhood](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/933301382/undo-motherhood)",

    "text": "\"He and She\" - excerpt from \"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\", by Yuval Noah Harari Excerpt from \"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\", by Yuval Noah Harari\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095\n\n***\n\n\"Different societies adopt different kinds of imagined hierarchies. Race is very important to modern Americans but was relatively insignificant to medieval Muslims. Caste was a matter of life and death in medieval India, whereas in modern Europe it is practically non-existent. One hierarchy, however, has been of supreme importance in all known human societies: the hierarchy of gender. People everywhere have divided themselves into men and women. And almost everywhere men have got the better deal, at least since the Agricultural Revolution.\n\nSome of the earliest Chinese texts are oracle bones, dating to 1200 BC, used to divine the future. On one was engraved the question: ‘Will Lady Hao’s childbearing be lucky?’ To which was written the reply: ‘If the child is born on a ding day, lucky; if on a geng day, vastly auspicious.’ However, Lady Hao was to give birth on a jiayin day. The text ends with the morose observation: ‘Three weeks and one day later, on jiayin day, the child was born. Not lucky. It was a girl.’4 More than 3,000 years later, when Communist China enacted the ‘one child’ policy, many Chinese families continued to regard the birth of a girl as a misfortune. Parents would occasionally abandon or murder newborn baby girls in order to have another shot at getting a boy.\n\nIn many societies women were simply the property of men, most often their fathers, husbands or brothers. Rape, in many legal systems, falls under property violation – in other words, the victim is not the woman who was raped but the male who owns her. This being the case, the legal remedy was the transfer of ownership – the rapist was required to pay a bride price to the woman’s father or brother, upon which she became the rapist’s property. The Bible decrees that ‘If a man meets a virgin who is not betrothed, and seizes her and lies with her, and they are found, then the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife’ (Deuteronomy 22:28–9). The ancient Hebrews considered this a reasonable arrangement.\n\nRaping a woman who did not belong to any man was not considered a crime at\n\nall, just as picking up a lost coin on a busy street is not considered theft. And if a husband raped his own wife, he had committed no crime. In fact, the idea that a husband could rape his wife was an oxymoron. To be a husband was to have full control of your wife’s sexuality. To say that a husband ‘raped’ his wife was as illogical as saying that a man stole his own wallet. Such thinking was not confined to the ancient Middle East. As of 2006, there were still fty-three countries where a husband could not be prosecuted for the rape of his wife. Even in Germany, rape laws were amended only in 1997 to create a legal category of marital rape.\n\nIs the division into men and women a product of the imagination, like the caste system in India and the racial system in America, or is it a natural division with deep biological roots? And if it is indeed a natural division, are there also biological explanations for the preference given to men over women?\n\nSome of the cultural, legal and political disparities between men and women reject the obvious biological differences between the sexes. Childbearing has always been women’s job, because men don’t have wombs. Yet around this hard universal kernel, every society accumulated layer upon layer of cultural ideas and norms that have little to do with biology. Societies associate a host of attributes with masculinity and femininity that, for the most part, lack a rm biological basis.\n\nFor instance, in democratic Athens of the fifth century BC, an individual possessing a womb had no independent legal status and was forbidden to participate in popular assemblies or to be a judge. With few exceptions, such an individual could not bene t from a good education, nor engage in business or in philosophical discourse. None of Athens’ political leaders, none of its great philosophers, orators, artists or merchants had a womb. Does having a womb make a person un t, biologically, for these professions? The ancient Athenians thought so. Modern Athenians disagree. In present-day Athens, women vote, are elected to public office, make speeches, design everything from jewelry to buildings to software, and go to university. Their wombs do not keep them from doing any of these things as successfully as men do. True, they are still underrepresented in politics and business – only about 12 per cent of the members of Greece’s parliament are women. But there is no legal barrier to their participation in politics, and most modern Greeks think it is quite normal for a woman to serve in public office.\n\nMany modern Greeks also think that an integral part of being a man is being sexually attracted to women only, and having sexual relations exclusively with the opposite sex. They don’t see this as a cultural bias, but rather as a biological reality – relations between two people of the opposite sex are natural, and between two people of the same sex unnatural. In fact, though, Mother Nature does not mind if men are sexually attracted to one another. It’s only human mothers steeped in particular cultures who make a scene if their son has a fling with the boy next door. The mother’s tantrums are not a biological imperative. A significant number of human cultures have viewed homosexual relations as not only legitimate but even socially constructive, ancient Greece being the most notable example. The Iliad does not mention that Thetis had any objection to her son Achilles’ relations with Patroclus. Queen Olympias of Macedon was one of the most temperamental and forceful women of the ancient world, and even had her own husband, King Philip, assassinated. Yet she didn’t have a t when her son, Alexander the Great, brought his lover Hephaestion home for dinner.\n\nHow can we distinguish what is biologically determined from what people merely try to justify through biological myths? A good rule of thumb is ‘Biology enables, Culture forbids.’ Biology is willing to tolerate a very wide spectrum of possibilities. It’s culture that obliges people to realise some possibilities while forbidding others. Biology enables women to have children – some cultures oblige women to realise this possibility. Biology enables men to enjoy sex with one another – some cultures forbid them to realise this possibility.\n\nCulture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. But from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible is by definition also natural. A truly unnatural behaviour, one that goes against the laws of nature, simply cannot exist, so it would need no prohibition. No culture has ever bothered to forbid men to photosynthesise, women to run faster than the speed of light, or negatively charged electrons to be attracted to each other.\n\nIn truth, our concepts ‘natural’ and unnatural’ are taken not from biology, but from Christian theology. The theological meaning of ‘natural’ is ‘in accordance with the intentions of the God who created nature’. Christian theologians argued that God created the human body, intending each limb and organ to serve a particular purpose. If we use our limbs and organs for the purpose envisioned by God, then it is a natural activity. To use them differently than God intends is unnatural. But evolution has no purpose. Organs have not evolved with a purpose, and the way they are used is in constant ux. There is not a single organ in the human body that only does the job its prototype did when it first appeared hundreds of millions of years ago. Organs evolve to perform a particular function, but once they exist, they can be adapted for other usages as well. Mouths, for example, appeared because the earliest multicellular organisms needed a way to take nutrients into their bodies. We still use our mouths for that purpose, but we also use them to kiss, speak and, if we are Rambo, to pull the pins out of hand grenades. Are any of these uses unnatural simply because our worm-like ancestors 600 million years ago didn’t do those things with their mouths?\n\nSimilarly, wings didn’t suddenly appear in all their aerodynamic glory. They developed from organs that served another purpose. According to one theory, insect wings evolved millions of years ago from body protrusions on flightless bugs. Bugs with bumps had a larger surface area than those without bumps, and this enabled them to absorb more sunlight and thus stay warmer. In a slow evolutionary process, these solar heaters grew larger. The same structure that was good for maximum sunlight absorption – lots of surface area, little weight – also, by coincidence, gave the insects a bit of a lift when they skipped and jumped. Those with bigger protrusions could skip and jump farther. Some insects started using the things to glide, and from there it was a small step to wings that could actually propel the bug through the air. Next time a mosquito buzzes in your ear, accuse her of unnatural behaviour. If she were well behaved and content with what God gave her, she’d use her wings only as solar panels.\n\nThe same sort of multitasking applies to our sexual organs and behaviour. Sex first evolved for procreation and courtship rituals as a way of sizing up the fitness of a potential mate. But many animals now put both to use for a multitude of social purposes that have little to do with creating little copies of themselves. Chimpanzees, for example, use sex to cement political alliances, establish intimacy and defuse tensions. Is that unnatural?\"",
