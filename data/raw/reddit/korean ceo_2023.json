    "text": "[Essay] Progressives/Feminists are bad at talking about men’s issues ###Preface\n\nI am not a feminist or an MRA. I only feel the need to preface with this given how uncharitable people can get when you’re even remotely critical of ideologies such as the one’s discussed here. I am also not an anti-feminist - though I do have strong objections to feminist rhetoric, institutions, and academia.\n\n###Introduction\n\nGender issues - we’re all aware of them. Men and women are expected to conform to certain roles, and are often punished when they don’t.\n\nIn the last century an ideology known as feminism emerged and rooted itself in progressive circles. Their initial concerns were legitimate; women couldn’t vote, own property, or divorce, among other things. The ideology achieved many victories, both legislative and social. Today, feminism is more popular than ever, garnering support from celebrities and multinational organizations like the United Nations. It’s taught in many schools as part of their mandatory curriculum, it’s widely supported among most progressives, and many would argue you would need to be one in order to even call yourself a progressive.\n\nWhy, then, is feminism so polarizing? Surely, there are plenty of women’s issues that exist today, and aside from far-right tradcons, who could really disagree with the fundamental premise of gender equality? Detractors of the ideology commonly claim that it’s “gone too far” - but what does that even mean? Many progressives claim that detractors of the ideology are reactionaries who simply misunderstand it. Is this really true? What’s actually going on here?\n\n###The Feminist Hypothesis\n\nFirst, it’s important to define feminism. If asked to define the ideology, most would say something like “the belief that both genders are equal / should be treated equally under the law”. This is an incomplete definition, however. This would be similar to defining liberalism as the belief in democracy. Of course, whilst believing in democracy is a necessary condition of liberalism, it’s not sufficient. Socialists (and even some fascists) believe in democracy, and they certainly aren’t liberals. Liberalism requires other beliefs, such as the right to private property (which socialists reject) and the belief in human rights (which fascists reject).\n\nFeminism, then, is more than just the belief in equality under the law. The other beliefs varies depending on the school of thought, but they’re all united in sharing one fundamental claim: that we live in a patriarchy that privileges men at the expense of women. More specifically, they argue that femininity is seen as inherently inferior to masculinity, and thus, all gender issues are fundamentally rooted in misogyny. For instance, it’s socially acceptable (even celebrated) for women to act masculine (eg, tomboys), but men who act feminine or often punished for it (they might be denigrated with insults that compare them to women - ‘pussy’, ‘sissy’, etc.). You can likely name several films with relatively masculine women (Ripley from Alien, Sarah Connor from Terminator, etc.), but almost no feminine male heroes. Women are punished for being women, men are punished when they aren’t masculine enough.\n\nFeminists conclude that the patriarchy hurts both men and women, and thus, everyone should be feminists and dismantle the patriarchy. \n\n###Critique\n\nThe issue with this hypothesis, and progressive gender ideology as a whole, is that it promotes a massive asymmetry in the way we view men’s issues compared to women’s. Progressives claim to value gender equality, but in reality they end up reinforcing the most rigid form of gender essentialism, even more-so than modern conservatives. This can be seen both in their rhetoric and in the legislation/social policies they support. I will demonstrate this by examining popular rhetoric and arguments used by feminists and progressives.\n\n**Toxic Masculinity**\n\nA controversial term that has emerged in recent years, “toxic masculinity” refers to the harmful set of expectations placed on men that causes them to hurt themselves or others. For instance, men are expected to be stoic, and so they may be less likely to seek out help when they need it. Men are expected to sleep with women, so they may physically lash out when rejected, since sexual conquest is tied to their self-worth.\n\nMany progressives claim that opponents of the term simply misunderstand it, but in reality, the reason people dislike the term is because there is a hypocritical asymmetry since “toxic femininity” is never discussed. Progressives end up being the biggest reinforcers of the traditional “toxic” masculine roles they claim to oppose. \n\nFor instance, the male suicide rate is often condescendingly blamed on “toxic masculinity”. We get the typical spiels from mainstream media about how men are pressured to be stoic, and if they could just open up emotionally, the male suicide rate would drop. This is an utterly bizarre argument, because statistically women are actually more likely to attempt suicide than men (men are more likely to succeed), yet this is never blamed on “toxic femininity”. Notice how mainstream media never claims that women are conditioned to be hyper-emotional, and if they could just learn to suppress their emotions, the attempted female suicide rate would drop. \n\nConsider too that women tend to not report rape or sexual assault out of a sense of shame or guilt. Would any progressive claim this is a consequence of “toxic femininity” - that women are pressured to be sexually chaste and “pure”, and that explains the lack of reporting? If anyone were to actually make such an argument, those same progressives would likely call them a victim blamer, yet this rhetoric is completely acceptable when it comes to men.\n\nIn other words, men and women both share the same reasons for committing suicide or not reporting rape (eg, shame), but it’s only framed as a systemic failure for women. For men, it’s framed as an insecure shortcoming, that they’re letting the pressures of “toxic masculinity” get to them, and they should just “do better” and seek help.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that women reinforce these “toxic” gender norms just as much as men, but that’s never acknowledged by progressives. Consider the [controversial Gilette ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0) from a few years ago, where they attempted to “tackle toxic masculinity”. In the entirety of the ad, only men are blamed for reinforcing harmful masculine gender norms, women are completely absolved (aside from a couple of audience members during the sitcom segment). In fact, [at one point the ad shows](https://youtu.be/koPmuEyP3a0?t=29) a male employee silencing a female employee - even when progressives try to talk about men’s issues, they can’t help but make it about women’s issues as well. \n\nThis asymmetry is more explicitly clear when you enumerate all the possibilities:\n\n* Man is sexist against man: Toxic masculinity\n\n* Man is sexist against woman: Toxic masculinity (not “toxic femininity”)\n\n* Woman is sexist against man: Toxic masculinity\n\n* Women is sexist against woman: Internalized Misogyny (not “toxic femininity”)\n\nWhen men receive sexism, it’s their “toxic masculine gender role” that oppresses them - in other words, they oppress themselves. But when women receive sexism, they are just simply victims to misogyny. If a woman tells a man to man-up, it’s considered toxic masculinity since it reinforces the traditional masculine gender role of stoicism. But if a man criticizes a woman for sexual promiscuity, it’s not considered toxic femininity, despite it reinforcing the traditional feminine gender role of chastity (in fact, it’s considered another instance of toxic masculinity). So whether men or women reinforce harmful gender expectations of either gender, it’s labelled “toxic masculinity”. The term essentially becomes synonymous with “sexism”. This is the fundamental issue people have with the term - the inherit conflation of ‘masculinity’ with ‘sexism’ - the asymmetry. \n\nThe great irony here is that progressives end up reinforcing the very traditional gender norms they claim to be against. That is, that men possess hyper-agency and can never be victims, that their problems are of their own causing, and that women are just helpless victims who do no wrong. \n\nIt's not surprising, then, that the biggest feminist messages to men in the last few years have just reinforced the traditional “toxic” gender norm that men should be protectors. Look at the United Nation's [#HeForShe](https://www.heforshe.org/en) campaign, that suggested men should essentially protect women. It's no different than telling men to \"man up\", it's just rebranded in woke packaging to make it palatable to progressives, and it works. Notice too that these demands are never asked of women (there is no #SheForHe). Progressive demand men to be traditionally masculine, whilst simultaneously criticizing them for it.\n\n**Patriarchy**\n\nThere is perhaps no term in modern discourse more useless or vague than “patriarchy”. It’s used as a buzzword by progressives (along with “capitalism” and “white supremacy”) to explain away almost any phenomenon in modern society. Earlier we defined the patriarchy as a social system that “privileges” men at the expense of women (or values masculinity over femininity), but the way progressives have abused this term borders on unfalsifiable tautology - framing all gender issues as women’s issues.\n\nAccording to progressives, if women commit more suicide than men, that's evidence that we live in a sexist patriarchy. But if men commit suicide more than women, that's also evidence we live in a sexist patriarchy, and this is an instance of the patriarchy hurting men. Men are given harsher sentences for the same crime? Actually that’s patriarchal backfiring, since society views women as having no agency. Women get custody more often? Well that’s because society views women as the caretaker, so it’s actually misogyny. Only men are drafted? Of course, society views women as weak and incapable - misogyny. No matter the outcome, it's always framed as patriarchy/misogyny, it’s just taken as an axiomatic truth.\n\nTo test whether a claim is vacuous, a useful exercise is to reverse the situation and see if the conclusion still holds. Suppose we lived a society where gender roles were reversed. Men would have issues with domestic violence, date-rape, representation in politics, wouldn’t be taken as seriously in the workplace, catcalling, were judged more for their looks, etc., and women would have a higher suicide rate, get harsher prison sentences for the same crime, get worse school grades for the same work, it would be legal to cut off their clitoral hoods at birth and suck their genital wounds (the male equivalent would be “oral suction circumcision” - yes this is an actual thing).\n\nWould anyone look at such a society and deem it an “oppressive matriarchy” that “privileges” women over men? If not, then why is it when the roles are reversed (as it is in our society) it’s deemed as an “oppressive patriarchy” that “privileges” men over women?\n\n**Male Privilege** \n\nProgressives are also very selective when they examine gender inequality, largely overlooking men’s issues, or even framing them as a privilege.\n\nConsider the gender wage gap. Progressives/feminists argue that the reason women earn less than men is because of sexist social pressures that encourage women to be stay-at-home mom’s and discourages them from higher-paying careers. Whether this is truly the result of sexism or biological predispositions is not what I care to discuss, but what is interesting is that the other side is never talked about; that is, that men are socially pressured to earn money. Consider if the roles were reversed; suppose men were pressured to be stay-at-home dad’s and take care of the children, whereas women were pressured to work dangerous jobs, work overtime, and would be considered deadbeats otherwise. \n\nIf this were the case, there would be no discussion of a gender pay gap for men. Instead, we would hear of a gender labor and death gap for women. We would hear complaints that women were expected to work more hours than men, expected to take physically dangerous work, and die more often on the job. We would get statistics about how “on average, women work X amount of hours more than men in a year”. We would hear about the negative health consequences of stress and working overtime, the toll that being the primary breadwinner has on a person, how men need to “step up” and stop placing the burden of income on women alone. Yet, when this expectation is placed upon men, there is zero discussion about the burden of being the breadwinner - in fact, quite the opposite, it’s framed as a privilege.\n\n**”But the Patriarchy hurts men too!”**\n\nOne popular talking point among progressives is that the “patriarchy” hurts men as well, and that critics of feminism mistake “patriarchy” as synonymous with “men”, but this is far from the truth.\n\nConsider the recent overturning of Roe v Wade. To be clear, I think the ban is wrong, but the response from many feminists is telling; they immediately jump to blaming men, despite the fact that men and women [share similar views](https://www.vox.com/2019/5/20/18629644/abortion-gender-gap-public-opinion) on abortion. Abortion is split among political lines, not gender lines, and despite progressives wishing the opposite, conservative women do exist.\n\nSo here we see the hypocrisy. On one hand they will claim that the patriarchy hurts men and women, and therefore feminism ought to be accepted by men. Yet, as soon as women are hurt by “the patriarchy”, the blame is immediately put on men, despite the fact that women reinforce/uphold harmful gender norms just as much as men. The fact that plenty of women supported the ban is ignored in favour of a convenient “male bad” narrative.\n\nSimilarly, if the “patriarchy” ends up hurting men, women’s agency/responsibility is totally ignored, and thus, the blame will lie on men. The term “patriarchy” becomes synonymous with “men”, with progressives blaming all of societies shortcomings on men alone.\n\nIf the hypocritical rhetoric is bad, the hypocritical institutions are far worse. Self-proclaimed feminist organizations like the United Nations (which claims to stand for gender equality) [finances the genital mutilation](https://news.un.org/en/story/2011/12/397192-un-launches-plan-accelerate-male-circumcision-aids-prevention-africa) of men in the Third World. whilst condemning the same mutilation of women. Then, that very same institution has the audacity to suggest that “men aren’t doing enough”, that “men need to stand against sexism”, and proceed to roll out initiatives like #HeForShe.  \n\nIt’s also worth noting that in the case of circumcision, the discarded foreskin is sometimes used to [produce skincare products](https://thesun.co.uk/fabulous/7836602/foreskin-facial-kate-beckinsale-how-serum-made/) for wealthy celebrities and socialites (likely the same that virtue signal about how misogynistic our society is). Could anyone imagine if male celebrities used skincare products derived from the skin tissue of amputated clitoral hoods from infant girls? Doubtless we would have international outrage and academic discourse about the “commodification of the female body” and whatnot. When it happens to men - radio silence (or mockery).\n\n**Progressives use right-wing rhetoric when it comes to men’s issues**\n\nMen’s issues are dismissed by progressives in the same way black issues are dismissed by conservatives. For instance, progressives blame the fact that men are more likely to be victims of violent crimes on other men, since men commit the majority of violent crime. Notice how this is no different to when conservatives blame black issues on black people. Compare “but it’s mostly men killing other men” to “but it’s mostly black people killing other black people”. Would progressives be okay with terms like “toxic blackness” to describe the negative aspects of black culture - eg, high crime rate, lack of fathers, misogyny in rap music, etc?\n\nConsider the fact that men are given harsher sentences for the same crime, compared to women. Feminists would argue that this is because society assigns hyper-agency to men and views women as weak and infantile, thus, men get harsher sentences. They would argue this is an example of how sexism against women ends up hurting men, that this is our patriarchal society “backfiring” on men. But notice that this logic completely falls apart when you swap gender for race. For instance, black people are sentenced to harsher sentences for the same crime compared to white people. Would any progressive unironically argue that this is because society views white people as weak and incapable, and thus this is an example of how racism against white people ends up hurting black people, that this is our “black supremacist” society backfiring on black people? The latter would be rightfully ridiculed, whereas the former is accepted and taught in sociology classes.\n\nUnder the feminist framework, it’s okay to blame men’s biological predispositions to dismiss male violence / male victims of violence, but don’t you dare suggest that those same biological predispositions may explain why men are more likely to be CEO’s. In other words, men’s failures are their responsibility, but their successes are not - their successes are the result of sexism, they’re illegitimate. (To be clear, I am not suggesting that biological predispositions are indeed the reason why men are more likely to be CEO’s; I am merely pointing out the hypocritical reasoning)\n\n\n**Media**\n\nSo how are men’s issues talked about by the media? Well, for the most part, they aren’t. But when they are, it can vary from blaming men for their issues (the typical spiels on toxic masculinity) to outright hostility.\n\n“Progressive” media outlet, Slate, once [ran an Op-Ed](https://slate.com/technology/2013/09/intactivists-online-a-fringe-group-turned-the-internet-against-circumcision.html) where they characterized and straw-manned the entire anti-circumcision movement as nothing but unhinged freaks, comparing them to anti-vaxxers. The article goes into great length smugly psycho-analyzing the motives of these activists, not even pretending to show balance or their side of the argument.\n\nThe United Nations absurdly claimed that [women would be the most impacted](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/11/un-women-says-russia-ukraine-war-exacts-high-price-from-women-girls.html) in regards to the invasion of Ukraine, despite men (some still being in high school) being banned from leaving the country. Evidently, men being forcibly conscripted to fight and possibly die doesn’t count as gender-based violence. It’s also worth noting that the UN emphasizes girls specifically, rather than all child refugees (boys and girls). Again, this is the same institution that tells men they just need to “do better” and stand up against inequality. \n \nVice, another “progressive” outlet, [recently wrote an article](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3vx8k/south-korea-incel-gender-wars-election-womens-rights) about the South Korean election, titled “Young, Angry, Misogynistic, and Male: Inside South Korea’s Incel Election”. \n\nTo summarize, the article describes how anti-feminist rhetoric has emerged as an electoral campaign topic among the populist candidate Yoon Suk-Yeol (in fact, he won the election as of writing this). The article mentions how these male voters feel disenfranchised from South Korean society, given the blatant double standards. For instance, military service is mandatory for men when they finish high school, but not for women. This means men have to abandon their families for 1.5 years while women get a head start in their careers. The candidate, Yoon, vowed to abolish the Ministry of Women, a division of the government concerned with women’s issues. Aside from some vague mentions of political bias and claims that the ministry “treats men like criminals”, the article never describes why he wants to abolish it, or why the voters want him to abolish it, it’s just taken as a presupposition that the Ministry is fair and just. \n\nThat’s it. That’s the entire article. This, according to Vice, makes you a “misogynistic incel”. We’re so deeply-entrenched in “progressive” gender politics that merely pointing out the double standard that men must do mandatory service is enough for “progressive” outlets to label you a women-hating incel. There’s not a single man they interview in the article that express any entitlement to women. Just being opposed to the hypocrisy makes you an incel apparently.\n\nIt’s totally possible that the candidate is indeed a misogynist or has sexist policy positions - I don’t know much about South Korea - but the greater point here is that the article never mentions any of this. According to the internal logic of Vice, men merely being upset at blatant double standards is enough for them to be labelled misogynistic incels. It’s also worth noting the hypocrisy of these “progressive” media outlets in labelling young men who are rightfully upset about being discriminated against as incels, despite these same outlets decrying how widespread “toxic masculinity” is, completely oblivious to how they reinforce it by characterizing any man who points out male discrimination as being a bitter, angry virgin.\n\nNone of these articles were hard to find. I found the first one through a basic google search, and the other two from trending twitter/reddit posts. There are dozens of more like this written every year, this was just a small sampling of how ridiculously hysterical progressive media is towards men’s issues.\n\n**Nice Guys**\n\nSpeaking of incels, the entire phenomenon of \"nice guys\" (men who disingenuously befriend women in an attempt to sleep with them) is ironically exacerbated by the very same \"progressives\" who claim to want to \"liberate\" men from their confined gender roles.\n\nProgressives, and mainstream media as a whole, demonizes male sexuality, characterizing it as creepy or predatory. Consider again the controversial Gilette ad from a few years back. There's a [scene where a man goes to approach a woman](https://youtu.be/koPmuEyP3a0?t=56), and then is stopped by his friend. It's the middle of the day, broad daylight, busy street, etc. so the woman is in no danger, yet according to progressives, even approaching women in public is problematic nowadays.\n\nIt’s no surprise that teenage boys take these messages to heart - that they’re inherently predatory and must suppress any desire to be blunt or forthcoming with what they want. They act amicable, nice, and passive, because that’s what they were told to do, and more importantly, they don’t want to risk being branded as a creep or sexual predator. When this inevitably doesn’t work out, they express frustration, and then the very same group that told them to act that way demonizes and mocks them for it.\n\nIt’s no surprise then why figures like Jordan Peterson and Andrew Tate get popular. The right-wing gives an alternative to alienated young men that doesn’t demonize them for being born with a penis.\n\n###Conclusion\n\nThe message from progressives/feminists is clear. Women’s issues are caused by society, and so society must change to accommodate women. Men’s issues are caused by men, and so men must “do better” and change to accommodate society. Women’s issues are systemic - men’s issues are individual failures. Social change for women - pull yourself by your bootstraps for men. \n\nUnder the feminist framework, sexism against men is framed as male privilege, whereas sexism that benefits women is framed as female oppression (consider the term “benevolent” sexism - even when women benefit, they’re still victims). Their rhetoric and language portray a victim narrative for women, and an oppressor narrative for men, no matter the circumstance.    \n\nAt the heart of progressive gender ideology is this absurd notion of trickle-down equality - that if we just focus on fixing women’s issues, men’s issues will just magically solve themselves. As time has come to past, it’s clear that this is simply not true. Women have made great strides in almost all sectors of life, whereas men have stagnated or even regressed, usually as the result of questionable social policies created in the name of “equity”. It is now blatantly clear that schools discriminate against male students for the same work compared to women, that universities and employers favour female candidates, and that ironic misandry is tolerated (even encouraged) in the public sphere, but even mentioning this is considered controversial. \n\nProgressives and feminists fundamentally view gender equality as a zero-sum game. Attention and resources given to men’s issues are resources that could be used towards women’s issues. In doing so, they must frame any good-faith opposition to their absurd ideology as right-wing reactionaries (take the “Manosphere” for instance - a new buzzword that lumps mass murdering incels with pick-up artists and men’s right’s activists - despite these groups having almost nothing in common). \n\nAll of this goes to show what is essentially tantamount to gaslighting on a global scale. \n\n“The patriarchy hurts both men and women” - but women’s issues are the only one’s taken seriously, whereas men’s issues are treated with condescension (or ignored). \n\n“Both genders reinforce harmful gender norms” - but only men are told to change, whereas women are assumed to be perfect.\n\n“We should encourage men to speak up about gender issues” - but if they do they’ll be labelled a misogynistic incel.\n\n“Feminism is for men” - but feminist organizations actively support blatantly anti-male legislation and policies (eg, UN financing male circumcision in the Third World).\n\nThe progressive hostility towards men’s issues is directly responsible for the rise of people like Andrew Tate, and I fully expect more figures like him to gain popularity in the near future. It’s hard to express just how frustrating it is to see even the most trivial of women’s issues discussed ad-naseum by progressives and mainstream media (eg, female multimillionaire actresses make slightly less than their male counterparts), whereas some of the most egregious human rights violations still being legal to commit against men is totally ignored, or even supported. The progressive failure has obviously reached a tipping point now - red pill content has exploded in popularity over the last year, and when the pendulum swings back, I expect there will be a fierce overcorrection from progressives. Unless progressives become willing to actually discuss men’s issues, things are only going to get worse, but chances of that seem slim.",

    "text": "Korean women works at game industry is under threat I signed in reddit today to let every feminists and women would know about what's happening is korea, so I'm not used to reddit but please understand me. (I'm not very good at English either) Maybe you all already know this case.\nSo start with the conclusion, Korean men🤏 made a women fired because she was a feminist.\nEverything started with the game Limbus Company of Project Moon. From last update, PM released a new illustration of female character Ishmael(inspired by the novel Moby Dick). The illustration was for the summer event. But hannams(short form for the korean man, a word that criticizes the stereotyped misogynistic behavior of Korean men.) was angry because they wanted erotic bikini illust. They first blamed the company, and the illustrator who draw that character illust. But they found out both illustrator and CEO were men, so they find other innocent women to blame, who is another illustrator.\nI have to tell this first to make you guys understand, Korea is very conservative patriarchal society. Still there are huge gap between men and women's income, and this society rejects feminist. They don't know the difference of radical feminist and liberal feminist. They even created word \"femi-Nazis\". \nThey claimed that the women illustrator is feminist because she retweeted tweet saying that illegal filming of women's bodies should be eradicated. \nHannams started mailing the company, they even went to company in real life, they wanted the feminist illustrator to be fired.\nAnd unbelievably, the company heard them, and did what they want. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/fluffybluesoul/status/1683860989819904001?s=46&t=-DFdIIYm3LEVayTejLZANA\n\nThis is the link of someone's English translation of the company's statement.\n\nA women was fired because she said no to violation againt women.\nShe was fired BECAUSE SHE WANTED WOMAN'S FAIR RIGHTS.\n\nNow in korea we are planing to protest at in front of company.
