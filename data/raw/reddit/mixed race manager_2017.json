    "text": "How to deal with a \"sexual harassment\" claim you feel is false or frivolous? So we hired a new girl in the office, and she is pretty talkative. She often strikes up conversation about various topics with her fellow employees. We are a small office of 15. Every Friday we eat lunch together.\n\nDuring a recent lunch the girl decided to discuss the topic of \"discrimination in the workplace based on gender\", she talked about how she felt it was hard to land a job in the tech industry because she was a woman. That once she lands in the job that there is a very prominent wage gap.\n\nA fellow employee said he believed the age gap to be a myth and that being a woman in tech actually has quite a few advantages.\n\nThe entire conversation was casual, without any animosity shown from either side. Just a calm discussion. I was literally sitting right next to them. I heard the entire thing! But later that day this employee came to my office and demanded the employee be punished for his \"insensitive remarks\", I refused. She has gone over my head and has filed a complaint with HR. I am now under pressure from the home office to terminate this 3 year veteran because they wish to avoid any negative press that could come as the result of a lawsuit.\n\nThis man did nothing wrong in my eyes. This new hire brought the topic up, she engaged him, and at no point let him know that she felt uncomfortable about the subject matter. The employee they wish me to terminate is my best, most hardworking employee.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\n---\nI read a lot of these comments, and I'd like to clarify that context of this conversation. I had already attempted to recreate the conversation on my notebook, since I'm sure I'll have to comb through it. From my recollection this is about 99% accurate. Maybe not in the exact words used, but in tone.\n\n---\nTranscript of Conversation\n---\n\n**Woman:** \"Hey, what do you all think about gender discrimination in the workplace? I think its a big issue, and that it isn't fair that women get paid less than men for doing the same job. I mean why should a woman have to suffer in the interview process just because she isn't a man. You know what I'm saying. Its ridiculous\"\n\n**Man:** \"I actually think that the wage gap is a myth. If you look at the studies it appears that men as a whole make more than women, but they are comparing two genders as a whole, not the individual reason's why. Women don't actually get paid less than men, that is illegal, and ridiculous.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"But then why do men make more than woman?\"\n\n**Man:** \"Well, most men tend to work longer hours and collect overtime. This also tends to lead to more promotions which in turns lead to higher salary. For example, more women tend to work part time jobs than men, since they are family oriented. This also leads to them leaving the company more often than men, because many will leave their jobs to concentrate on motherhood.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"But that doesn't justify paying them less.\"\n\n**Man:** \"No I totally agree with you. What I'm saying is that they are not getting paid less at all. They are making the same pay, but due to more women working part time jobs and not receiving promotions due to putting in less hours, the studies numbers are off.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"How are the studies off?\"\n\n**Man:** \"The studies are correct in that they take the same amount of men and women with the same jobs, and add up their salaries, but its not relevant to proving a Wage Gap, since it does not take into account hours worked. Meaning, both are getting paid the same amount, but men simply work more hours, so the numbers are inflated.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"Any type of discrimination is wrong, no matter how many hours a woman works, she should be paid the same.\"\n\n**Man:** \"Oh yes, I totally agree. But what I'm saying is that the numbers in the studies that's support the wage gap just appear higher on the men's side because more hours are worked. They are paid the same. Meaning, that if we are both hired for the same job, at the same time, for the same payscale and then I work 60 hours a week, and you work 40 hours, and somebody were to compare our paychecks and then ask why is my pay higher than yours, then logical answer is because I worked more hours.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"Well not all women are hired on at the same pay.\"\n\n**Man:** \"Well, when that happens I surely doubt its immediately because of gender discrimination. It is usually because a person just negotiated a better salary during the higher process.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"Why do men get to negotiate salary?\"\n\n**Man:** \"Everybody can negotiate salary. Being a good negotiator has nothing to do with gender. Maybe that person had more work experience, or simply had a better 3 month plan. So many factors its impossible to know. However, you will run into a lot of jerks that will discriminate based on a bunch of stupid things. I was once fit shamed out of a job, because I looked intimidating and made the developers uncomfortable. Or so I was told.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"That's terrible, did that really happen?\"\n\n**Man:** \"Yes, they asked me if I could wear baggier shirts to work, and when I asked why that's what they told me, so I quit. I've also seen discrimination work against men just as it does women. At several of my past companies some of the pig headed managers hired attractive, newly graduated college girls over more qualified applicants just so they could have something to look at. Or as they justified it, improve office morale.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"Wow, that sounds terrible. How often does that happen.\"\n\n**Man:** \"Quite a lot I believe. But either way anybody who discriminates is doing so because they are an asshole. Not because there is some widespread corporate conspiracy to suppress a certain race or gender. Some people suck, and others are cool. As is life. But honestly I would say that in today's current climate being a woman has its advantages. Many companies feel pressured to hire women just to avoid being classified as justifying the wage gap. Particularly in tech. When you start going to conferences you'll see at least a dozen different panels about empowering women in tech or the workplace. You wont find any of those for men. So, its a widespread agenda that companies need to hire more women, and that definitely will work towards your advantage.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"I don't think if I agree with that.\"\n\n**Man:** \"Well, eitherway I still think the Wage Gap is a myth that has been debunked with numbers and research, so rest assured, despite what the media tells you, you are always going to get equal pay. If not, then you can sue.\"\n\n**Woman shrugs and changes subject.**\n\n*This is a throwaway account",

    "text": "Looking much younger than you are and getting respected in the workplace. So I'm 32 but people constantly assume I'm in my late teens or early twenties despite my receding hairline.   I've been carded for trying to buy a lottery ticket.  It's just the way my face is, small jaw pale skin etc.   The way I look has affected many areas of my life, but more and more I see how it affects the way I'm regarded in the workplace.  \n\nI have an engineering degree and years of experience, but I am still treated like I just graduated high school.  Some will dismiss what you say, some will try to bully you because they think they can.  \n\nThe more I observe people's behavior in the workplace the more I see how much looks impact employment.  In my own company, all of management (all of the men at least) are tall and handsome.   For the most part people are promoted here based on the buddy system and not based on merit, experience, or education.\n\nIt becomes even more​ dynamic when you look at people that work the production line and people that work in corporate.  The people that work in the low end positions are mostly unattractive, most of the women are overweight, the only exception to this is the young employees that don't have any experience.  The people in the higher end positions are mostly more attractive, and this is even more striking looking at the difference between the position women are in at my company.  The only exception to this is having very specialized skill sets, but even then, even for engineering positions looks seem to matter.  People talk about equal treatment regardless of race and gender, but one thing that seems to get overlooked is discrimination based on attractiveness.",

    "text": "Help - Being \"Professionally\" Bullied at Work **Background:** I currently work in the advertising industry, specifically Digital Ad Operations, for a big-name company. My job is to work on the technical side of things, generating (not by hand) the code necessary to make ads display on websites (among other things) and then deliver them to contacts at websites such as Facebook, YouTube, etc. I've work in an office setting before, but this is my first job out of college. In my experience, and also in what I've read and seen, it's general a job that is \"tailored\" to straight-out-of-college employees. You are not expected to have any prior knowledge of the job, but you *are* expected to be competent enough to pick it up quickly. In other words, it's not something you study for in college. The job is request-based by nature, meaning you get an email with the task, confirm receipt, do it, and then confirm that it's finished. I've worked here for a little over 2 years now. \n\n-----------------------\n\n**The Issues:** Since I've been here, I haven't been promoted. I understand that this is something earned. However, going from entry level to Senior is not something particularly difficult. Half of it is about doing a good job, while the other half of it is just...a participation award, really. Meaning, just do your work and eventually you will/should get promoted. Since I've been here, I noticed that performance reviews are not a thing; in my over 2 years here, I have not had one. I've asked for one several times, and I've gotten mixed responses ranging from, **Director:** *\"Well, I've reached out to upper management about a formal process, but haven't heard back\"*, to *\"Eventually, we will get to that.\"* The problem with this is that since I've been here, I've barely gotten any positive feedback. I've seen waves of coworkers promoted (which is a $13,000 increase in pay), while I remain a entry level, despite overwhelmingly-positive feedback from other director and managers that I work with. Even those I've never met in person, and who I've only spoken with on the phone. I have a reputation for going above and beyond to resolve issues when I can help it. I won't lie and pretend that I haven't made any mistakes, but I would say that the majority of my work is objectively very good. I've lost track of how many times I've ended up in meeting rooms with my director and new manager (who was previously my supervisor and was promoted). The topics have ranged from:\n\n\n\n* **Lateness:** It is true that I had issues arriving on time way back when I started, but I've made great strides to arrive on time or even early. For reference, I work in NYC, and there are train issues almost every day. I've come to realize that this is my problem and mine alone, and that I need to work around this. However, what really bothers me is that I broke my wrist in February and notified my manager that I needed extra time to get ready in the morning. She said this was okay. I arrived in the office one morning sometime between 9:45 AM and 10 AM, and my director immediately called me into a meeting room. She opened with a rude and sarcastic remark, and then told me that she was reporting me to HR for arriving late so often. I showed her my broken wrist and she acted like she didn't know, which is impossible considering she and my manager speak often, even if she's never actually in the office. She asked me if I needed disability leave, and I said no. Eventually the meeting ended, and she still reported me to HR. I visited HR to explain my situation, and the woman understood.\n\n* **Unexplained absences from my desk:** This one has never really been elaborated on; it's just kind of tacked on with no examples. I get up to go to the bathroom, get a coffee or water, or just stretch my legs. I might go across he street to Starbucks or something, but it's not as if I'm gone for more than 15 minutes. My job is a desk job, and in the words of my previous manager, sometimes you need a break from the screen as the work can become a blur. My work still gets done in a timely manner. Additionally, we don't get paid during our lunch breaks, yet my manager told me that the director said *\"If you have time to take a lunch break, you're not busy.\"*\n\n* **\"Sitting\" on requests:** My director claims I sit on work before starting it, but that isn't true. My team and I CC each other on emails/work that involves us all, but not work that is specific to one person. When I have been busy with such work, I notify my team so they know that I'm working on something and can't assist them with anything else. \n\n* **\"Unnecessary pushback on work\":** Absolutely no idea where this is coming from. If we receive a request that isn't sent in the correct format, we kindly ask the person(s) sending it to resubmit it correctly. Again, not really sure where this is coming from. \n\n----------------------\n\n**Other Concerns:**\n\n* The environment is very much upper management looking after themselves. My director hires people who do little to no work to work with her/under her. She promoted a manager who is almost never in the office to an Associate Director position, a position which never existed until then. This Associate Director told us that her \"role is undefined\" when my manager asked her why she doesn't help us out\n\n* My director is a people-pleaser. She doesn't defend us at all; she lets our team take the fall for everything\n\n* My manager quit because she was thrown under the bus by my director and her name and reputation became tarnished in the company; another company that we pay to QA our ads let something pass QA that shouldn't have, and my manager got in trouble instead of representatives from that company. \n\n* My director hired *another* Associate Director rather than promote my manager, which roadblocked her career, which was the final straw for her and ultimately the reason she left. This new AD doesn't know how to do the work.\n\n* I've witnessed my director fire an employee of 10 years, who had an 8-month pregnant girlfriend, semi-publicly; he came out of a meeting room crying and was told to grab and his stuff and leave. The company hired him back the same day in another department. She did the same to another coworker, no bag or box provided.\n\n* We have lost 12 people in a year, on a team of about 20. I think we're about 8-10 people now. For every 3 or so people who leave, we get 1 new person. The team has been understaffed for a while, and it's a universal concern among my coworkers. We get the usual, \"We're interviewing\" from upper management, but it seems like they don't care about retention. This is a concern because training people to be able to do this job autonomously takes a lot of time and babysitting, for lack of a better term. Additionally the work becomes stressed and strained with the additional workload, due to the nature of the job\n\n* Previously, I had a senior (one who started 7 months after me, and who I had trained...), a supervisor, and a manager. All 3 of them have left the company for pretty much the same reasons. My team (meaning my immediate team) is just me and a new employee who started about 2 months ago, who I have been managing and training. I currently work on/own the biggest account that the company has (a huge consumer products company I cannot mention), as well as a second account, and my new AD has been trying to get me to help out on a third against my insistence that I cannot handle that workload\n\n-------------- \n\n**Current Situation/Why I'm Posting:** My director called a meeting between HR, the new AD (who has been there for about a month), and myself last week. She never told me HR would be there, but when I saw the woman come into the office I packed my things in anticipation of being fired (NY is an At-Will Employment State). While I was nervous, I thought that this would be the end of my sleepless nights, stomach issues from nervousness, and fear/hatred of coming to work. I had started looking for new jobs recently because I had given up hope of getting Senior and being able to apply with that on my resume.  I get into the meeting room, and I notice everyone has a 3-page paper in front of them. My director puts on the good cop impression and starts talking to me about the things I outlined above. I countered them and even provided printed emails from recently, going back two years of the contrary (especially about my quality of work and my reputation within the company). I even showed how she was on these email chains. She didn't care and said something to the effect of, \"While others outside of this department may think you do a great job, I don't.\" I also explained how I am carrying the workload of at least 3 other people/former employees. She still didn't care. The HR woman just sat there taking notes. Eventually she tried to shut me up by saying it was pointless arguing the past, and gave me this Performance Warning/Improvement Plan to look over and sign. It basically details the issues and how we're going to fix them (which are things I have already been doing). I was completely shocked, but took the paper without signing it. At the bottom is a blurb about how NY is an At-Will Employment state and how they can let me go at any time (I knew this already). \n\nOne of my coworkers who left to a competitor referred me at his new place, and I've completed the final round of interviews last week. I feel like I have a very good chance of getting it. I also have a lot of job opportunities/offers from friends and previous coworkers, totally unrelated to this situation. I'm afraid of being fired, but I **do not** want to sign this paper because I don't agree with what I'm being accused of. I've drafted counter-points to send back to the HR woman rather than the signed document, but I fully expect this to be a one-way street. \n\n**What is the correct thing to do in this situation?** I've felt bullied throughout my entire career here, and I feel like the negative feedback has really damaged me over time. It hurt my self-worth and made me feel drained of energy and on-edge/nervous all the time. That's why it took me so long to find the will to leave to another job. I know not to sign this document, but I'm afraid that I'm going to fired immediately. I also know that because I have more experience than most people here, and because I \"own\" the largest account the company has, they will be screwed if I leave on a whim (or even 2 weeks). So I'm kind of in this limbo, where I think they're trying scare tactics on me, but I'm not sure. Thus far, it's been a domino effect of people leaving, and a lot of people who left have shared similar sentiments.",

I was sitting at my desk when a lady walked up, wanting assistance to order checks. She was older, seemed nice.\n\nShe sat down and I was pulling up the check order system when she goes, \"thank god you're not one of those brown people.\"\nI was taken aback. I couldn't have heard that right. \"Excuse me?\" Was all I could even think to say.\n\"I can never understand those Mexicans. And they can't help me. Thank goodness you're not one.\"\nI take a lot of shit at work. But that type doesn't fly. I gave her back her debit card and told her that if she wished to speak like that she could leave. She continued while she tried to take out her ID card, which was expired anyways. I told her I would not be able to help her today, and that she would be welcome to come back when she could speak about other human beings in a respectful manner.\n\nI know it's not a big thing, but that...I can't tolerate that.\n\nThanks for listening.\n\nEdit: To clarify some things. I work at a bank, and my manager heard the conversation and backed me up. We have a no tolerance policy for hate. I was firm but polite, I did NOT demean her. She did not make a scene. She said okay and left.\nAlso, I am also brown. I am mixed and my husband and his family are Mexican.",

    "text": "My gynecologist diagnosed me with chlamydia in August of 2015 and I just found out yesterday. I'm freaking out. I'm about to word vomit all of my thoughts/feelings because I feel like there are very few real-life friends I can talk to about this stuff. TwoX has always been a supportive community in the past, so I'm hoping you all can talk me through this. I'm using a throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nI'm going to start with what I think is some necessary background information. When I went away to college (2009), I made a vow to myself to get tested every year at my annual exam - which happens to always been in August. So August 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2014 - I was tested and confirmed negative for everything.\n\nIn September of 2013, I started dating a dude (K) and things got serious. We moved in together in January of 2014. Even though I was in a faithful, monogamous relationship, I decided to still get tested at my yearly exam in August 2014 and 2015. In 2014, my doctor called to let me know everything was fine. In 2015, I never heard anything from my doctor, but assumed \"no news is good news\" and went about my business. I had started graduate school and was working a crazy demanding job...so it was the last thing on my mind. I went again in August of 2016 and when they asked if I wanted to be tested, I declined. I had been in a serious relationship for SO LONG, there was no way I contracted anything and I didn't want to shell out the extra cash.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. I got the Nexplanon put in a week or so ago and went to the doctor for my follow up. My doctor is new to me (the last two gynecologists I saw have since moved offices), and was doing a review of my medical history with me. She asked, \"I see you never came in for a follow up for your chlamydia in 2015. Does that ever cause any problems for you?\"\n\nI stared at her. \"I've never had chlamydia.\" \n\n\"I could have sworn I just saw that on my chart! Let me double check.\"\n\nWhile she flipped through the system, I explained, \"Yeah there's no way. I was in a super serious relationship at that time, and if I would have tested positive - that would have definitely been a red flag and I'd CERTAINLY remember. We didn't break up until July of 2016, so there's no way. Plus I would definitely remember hearing that.\" I wasn't freaking out - I figured she just had me mixed up with someone else. I actually thought it was kind of funny and started texting a friend to tell her about the silly mix-up.\n\nThen she turned the screen to me and confirmed. Yup - I tested positive in August of 2015. It's now March of 2017 and this is the first I'm hearing of it. I tried explaining \"But I have none of those symptoms! I never have!\" She gently (and visibly uncomfortably) explained that a lot of times, chlamydia is asymptomatic. I couldn't stop crying as she quickly retested me and tried to calm me down. I could tell she felt awful for being the messenger. \n\nI was a hysterical mess. I spent my afternoon calling every supervisor, wondering how they could have managed to NOT let me know. I was choking on tears on second and screaming with rage the next. I was in the throws of a full-on panic attack at one point. Turns out, there was a typo in my phone number. They attempted to contact me 3 times, and when there was no response (WRONG NUMBER), they stopped trying. They called a prescription into my pharmacy, but they couldn't reach me either. Because the phone number was one digit off. \n\nI have gone to the doctor 5-6 times since then. No one's mentioned it. No one's checked. I even went once for a yeast infection. ITCHING AND BURNING! Shouldn't SOMEONE have glanced at my file and raised an eyebrow?! The head honcho at the doctor's office accredited the oversight to staff turnover. Since both doctors left, it just kind of fell through the cracks. She was mortified and profusely apologetic. I think she felt bad listening to me hyperventilate over the phone.\n\nAnyway. I had to have that difficult conversation with my new partner. He was incredibly supportive and understanding. What a perfect, beautiful man I've found. \n\nBut I'm really struggling. I understand chlamydia is very treatable and really \"not a big deal\"....but I feel absolutely disgusting. I feel filthy. I'm humiliated that my ex cheated (and didn't use protection) and I had no clue. I'm terrified that there are going to be long term consequences for having left this untreated for so long. Everything I read online says PID or cervical cancer. Fuck. Because of a typo in my phone number. \n\nI feel like I'm overreacting, but I cannot stop crying. I came to work today and I keep having to excuse myself to the bathroom to choke back tears. \n\nWhat should I do? How can my doctor make this right? Can they even do anything? How do I get over this disgusting tainted feeling that I have? Any advice is appreciated and desperately needed. \n\nI probably didn't explain myself well. I'm at work and venting on my lunch break. Please ask questions if anything is unclear. I'll be checking throughout the afternoon and when I get home later this evening.\n\nTLDR - I tested positive for chlamydia and went unnotified for almost 2 years.",

    "text": "I need some advice, possibly legal advice. I am the resident pediatrician for a small private hospital in Africa. I got into work today and found a situation. \n\nA 7 month old baby was brought in last night for cough and fever. The doctor prescribed amoxyclav and paracetamol suppository. Pharmacy for one reason or other dispensed pantoprazole 40mg oral tablet to the parents instead of the suppository. The parents read the prospectus and realised the blunder. They have made it known that they intend to sue the hospital. We don't know if the pantoprazole was actually given p.r.\n\nManagement has requested that I be there when the parents return all lawyered up. The hospital and pharmacist is clearly in the wrong here. How can I make this better for us, and more importantly, the child? Haven't been involved in any legal problems thus far, let alone medicolegal. How should I handle this as the pediatrician? What are some of the things I should be weary of?\n\nEDIT: The child was given the pantoprazole p.r. We have called our lawyer. We have called the parents as well to bring the child in for review and monitoring over the next 24 hours. They have agreed. Waiting for them to rock up. Hoping for an amicable conclusion to this. Admin will do as they please with the pharm tech.\n\nEDIT 2: Met the parents and child. They were very calm and amicable. No lawyers. Child was still febrile obviously since they had no antipyretic. On taking history the problem became a bit more clear. The pharm tech dispensed the brand name Panto-Denk instead of Para-Denk. What saved the day was that the mother managed to retrieve the tablet a few minutes after p.r. insertion when they realised it was a wrong medication. They showed it to me. It was pretty much intact. I gave them the correct medication, apologised and sent them home to return after 3 days for review. I hope that closes the case. Advised chief of pharmacy to address the actual problem at hand i.e. mix up of meds. \n\nThank you all for you advice and contributions.",

    "text": "I had a psychotic breakdown at work This will be a very long post. But I feel like it's worth reading. As fellow nurses, you all know that we stretch ourselves too thin. We work long hours. We have stressful shifts. We push our bodies and our minds over and over again. For our patients. For our coworkers. For our families. We all know that we should take care of ourselves. We all know we should eat better, exercise more, drink less. Stop saying yes to picking up extra shifts. Stop going without sleep so we can spend time with our friends and families on our off days. Of course we know all that. But we're nurses, it's just what our life is like. So we keep going. Until we break. This is my story about my break.\n\nI had worked 3 night shifts in a row. Nothing new. I've always worked nights. I hadn't slept well at all, also not new. I've been taking meds for insomnia for about 5 years. I was on call from 2300-0700 for night number 4. I had got somebody to cover the first 4 hours of my call because I wanted to go to a mystery theater dinner thing. The day after shift 3 I didn't sleep. At all. Just could not fall asleep, even with drugs.  I should have skipped the dinner and tried harder to get some sleep. But I was really looking forward to it so I got up an I went. And then of course I got a text saying they would need me at 2300. I was already so tired, my eyes were burning and my face was flushed. I was over emotional already. But they needed me so I had to go. \n\nI work in L&D. I've been at this unit for about a year. Before this I worked step down. I'm pretty comfortable in L&D now. Still haven't encountered a lot of things but for the most part I'm confident in my skills. When I get to work the unit is slammed. And there are 2 triages that had just come in that my charge nurse gives me. Both are rule out labor. As soon as I start working I realize I'm kind of off. I go to the supply room for something and totally forget what. I stare at a fetal strip forever before being able to analyze it. I forget where to go in our charting system to get to certain things. One of the triages is fine, going to be discharged. The other is 38 weeks and having contractions every 2-7 minutes. Her cervix is 2/60/-2. Her doctor happens to be on the unit for another delivery so I let her hang out on the monitors to wait to see what the doctor wants to do. So I start working on discharging the other patient. About half an hour or so later I've discharged the other patient and the MD gets out of the other delivery. She looks at the strip and says \"She's having lates. Why haven't you admitted her?\" I look at her strip (even though I'd been checking it regularly and it looked okay) and see she HAS been having deceleration. Go in the room and patient is obviously in pain. Recheck her she's 4/80/-1. I try to get an IV so I can start her bolus for an epidural. I'm flustered and scared, I have the volume on the monitor up and I can hear baby's heart rate keeps dipping. I can't get the IV. I go to get some help. The other nurse gets the IV quickly and I start a bolus, turn the patient to the left and put her on some oxygen. Strip still looks iffy but I just can't really get a good picture of what's going on. I don't know what to do. So I go out to the nurse's station and ask somebody else to take a look at it. \"Oh yeah, looks like she started having variables here. And then they turn into lates here. And now her variability is minimal.\" I start crying. It was like a faucet got turned on. I can not calm myself down and stop crying. Everybody surrounds me and keeps asking me \"How can I help you? What can I do?\" And I can't even think straight to know what to ask them to do. So my charge nurse switches around assignments and I give the labor patient away and get some post partum patients instead.\n\nThe next few hours are horrible. I keep crying randomly, my eyes are so swollen and my face is red. I can't concentrate on anything. I'm having a hard time keeping up with which patient needs what. All the nurses keep looking at me like \"You poor thing\" and being overly sugary and sweet towards me. \n\nAround 0530 thing start getting worse. I was looking at a nurse telling her something about the labor patient I had and I thought that I saw her eyes dilating and then contracting back. I kept staring straight into her eyes. I would tilt my head to left and then back to center over and over, all while looking into their eyes and seeing them dilate and contract over and over. I snapped out of it after about thirty seconds and was terrified. The nurse was obviously a little freaked out and kept asking if I was okay. I tried to shake it off and kept telling myself the shift was almost over. I'd be able to sleep soon. But then it happened again. My heart was pounding and I started hyperventilating. At this point all of the nurses are very worried about me. My charge nurse talks me into going to the ER. I try to call my boyfriend as my charge nurse walks me down to the ER but he doesn't pick up. Once in the ER ever person I interact with I think is in this little \"trance\" where their eyes glass over and dilate while I stare. I start to think that I'm somehow infecting these people when I look at them and making them go into a trance.\n\nThe get me back to triage quickly. My HR and BP are through the roof. I can hardly talk at this point. I'm trying to explain how I'm feeling to the triage nurse but every time I look at him he starts going into this trance. I really start panicking at this time. I keep telling the triage nurse to get help because I'm making him sick. I keep going over ACLS steps in my head because I think that either I'm about to code or this triage nurse is. My boyfriend calls me back at this point and I tell him to get to the ER because I feel like I'm coding. \n\nThey get me back to a room. Every single person that comes in I think is in this trance. They seem like they're walking slow and moving slow. Their eyes are glazed, pupils dilated. Speech is slow. The nurse and doctor step out at one point and I press the code blue button in the room because I'm certain I'm dying. My heart is racing, my chest is tight, I'm dizzy. And I see all these people in trances and I know I'm going to code and there will be nobody there to help me. I keep snapping in everybody's faces in hopes they will wake up. I'm screaming and crying. \n\nMy boyfriend shows up around this time. I look at him and even HE goes into this trance. I hit him in the chest trying to wake him up. I keep telling him I love him so much and that I'm sorry. I tell him he doesn't have a pulse and I'm so sorry that I've made everybody sick because nobody can help him. There are several nurses and techs and they're trying to hold me down and I'm fighting them. Hard. They try to get an IV but I'm moving too much. They then roll me to the side to give me an IM injection (Benadryl and Ativan). I'm screaming and fighting them because I don't understand what's going on and I think they're giving me something to kill me (because I'm making everybody go into this trance.) I get away from them and get off the stretcher. There are people in and out of the room constantly. They're trying to talk me down. At one point when there is nobody in the room and I sit against the door and try to barricade people from coming in. I manage to get my cell phone and I call 911. I tell them that everybody at my hospital is in a trance and they're trying to kill me. My boyfriend gets the phone from me and is trying his best to calm me down. I keep trying to drag him out of the room (I was trying to get out of the hospital because I thought 911 would be sending EMS). \n\nI start feeling weak and strange. I think that I'm starting to die from the injection they gave me. They're trying to get me back on the stretcher and into wrist restraints. I'm biting and kicking at this point. They try to put paper scrubs on me (I had taken my scrubs off by this point..dunno why). I think they're trying to put a hood over my head so I won't see when they kill me. They give me another injection (Haldol). I'm still trying to get up. Finally all the drugs start hitting me. I'm certain I'm slowly dying at this point. They tell me I've been PEC'd and start explaining things to my boyfriend. I think it's weird that they would bother with a PEC since they tried to kill me. I start feeling very drowsy and weak. They make my boyfriend leave the room since I'm PEC'd. He tells me he'll be back at 1300 for visiting hours. I told him \"Fine, but I'll be dead by then.\" The nurses slowly filter out as it becomes obvious that I won't need to be held down anymore. The leave a sitter in the room that looks terrified. I drifted in and out, at this point I have accepted the fact that I'm going to die and I'm just glad I'm going to be able to sleep. \n\nI sleep a bit on and off and slowly start coming to my senses. I realize I'm not going to die. I start getting scared that I've been PEC'd. My boyfriend comes back and I get him to tell me his side of things. Later that afternoon EMS come to transport me to a psych facility. By that time I'm pretty much back to my baseline. \n\nThe psych facility terrifies me. I'm on a general adult psychiatric ward. The first person to talk to me was a schizophrenic patient that was telling me that I was his daughter and was yelling at me because I took the elevator when he had told me to take the stairs. What in the fuck? I do not belong here. They start me on new meds for sleep (Seroquel). I sleep like a baby and feel fine other then being anxious about being in a psych ward. I think surely they'll let me go home after reviewing the PEC. I'm not a harm to myself or others, I'm not suicidal, I'm not depressed, I'm no hallucinating. Nope. I was there for 9 day. I don't know whether they held me so long because I was a nurse and they wanted to insure I was safe to go back to work. Or maybe because I had good insurance. I saw patients that were in for suicide attempts and active hallucinations leave before me. All medicaid patients. As a nurse, it was definitely enlightening to see this world from a patient side. I now have a very very negative view of short term inpatient psychiatric care. Now this could have been a bad example of typical units. I could write a book. Hell maybe I should.\n\nAnyway. I'm back to work now. Still on nights because I can't find an L&D day position. Thankfully we self scheduled on my unit so I've been able to make sure I don't work more than 3 shifts in a row. The Seroquel is helping with sleep, but I have already had to go up on the dosage for it to be effective. I'm terrified every time I work that I won't be able to sleep. I'm terrified that this will happened again. I never got an official diagnosis but I assume it was a severe panic attack with psychotic features. A small part of me wonders what if this was just a precursor to some psychological illness. All of the nurses on my unit have been so supportive. I still get weirded out at work sometimes, deja vu and what not. I still hate having patients in the room that that labor patient was in. I still feel weird around the nurses that were there that night. It was a terrible experience, I still remember most of it so vividly. The delusion of everybody being in a trance still seems so so realistic to me. I've talked to so many people about how it looked from an outside perspective. I wish I could understand exactly what happened. It's awful to have your mind betray you.\n\nThank you for anybody that read. It feels good to see all of this down in black and white. And please, take my experience as a warning. You are not invincible. You can not keep running your body into the ground. One day your body and mind will say \"Enough.\"",

    "text": "This is illegal, right? So I work in dialysis... this is a big-money field dominated by for-profit companies.  The company I work for is very numbers-oriented, which means that they are more interested in looking good than actually having good outcomes for patients.  Somehow this equates with getting more money from Medicare.  I don't know shit about this, and I don't care.\n\nThe current thing they are pushing:  Before the patient goes on dialysis, they weigh in.  We see how much weight they have gained between treatments (from not peeing out the fluid they take in), and we program the machine to remove fluid to get them to a \"goal weight\" or \"dry weight.\"  The dry weight is determined by the physician or NP as part of the patient's prescribed treatment.\n\nFor a few months now, management (i.e. non-clinical people) have been telling me that I need to change the patient's goal weight every day, so they come off treatment at their goal weight 100% of the time.  Four of the five docs I work with have asked me not to do this.  They want to prescribe the goal weight for their patients, which is fine with me.  I'm not a doctor, it's not my job to make this shit up.  The patients are seen once a week by their doc or NP, so there is plenty of opportunity to change goal weights when the patient is legitimately gaining or losing weight.\n\nToday I got an email from my boss saying \"You WILL start doing this by the end of the month.\"  The thing is, no, I will not start doing that.  Last time I checked, I'm a nurse, and I don't get to change physician orders without, well.... an order from a physician.\n\nWhen a patient is unable to reach their goal weight in a single dialysis treatment, it's likely because they drank too much and are fluid overloaded.  The docs want us to remove as much fluid as we can safely take off, and if it takes a week to get them to goal weight, so be it.  I tend to agree with this, since it is more likely to actually keep the patient healthy and out of the hospital.\n\nChanging weights from day to day just to make numbers look good makes no sense to me.  The docs and NPs are irate.  I have great relationships with them, and I showed the email to one of the NPs.  They do NOT want me changing orders.  I have been told that I \"need to educate these doctors.\"  Then I laughed so hard I almost fell off my unicorn.  My boss says that if I'm not comfortable talking to the docs about this, she will talk to them. Be my guest, I say.  I've had 4 bosses in the last year.  I have talked to the docs about it, and I heard what they had to say, and I agree with them.  The company is proposing a practice that is not good for patient outcomes, and it also violates my scope of practice.  I love my docs and they trust me; I have never felt so respected by physicians as I have by my nephrologists.  I refuse to do something they have explicitly said they don't want me to do.\n\nSo is there any recourse for nurses in this situation?  Obviously, I am looking for a new job in a new area of nursing, which is a mixed bag of emotions.  There are a lot of other things going on at this job that is making it suck, but asking me to risk my license by violating my scope of practice is the last nail in the coffin.  I'd hate to see other dialysis nurses get in trouble because they don't have the brass balls I have to look my boss in the eye and say no.  Is this something I can ask my state board of nursing about?",

    "text": "New Grad Fired from first Job M.24 and I graduated nursing school in August 2016. I applied for jobs as soon as I graduated, and I applied for my dream Job in the only level one trauma center in state. I had the job actually before I passed boards so the pressure was on to pass boards,  which I did. \n\nI start and everything was so exciting, I saw so much and I precepted with a really resourceful and knowledgeable nurse. The only downside to this was that during my orientation we did mostly administrative things, or we would help out other nurses with tasks like starting an IV or giving a med but we never had patients of our own. But as a new nurse I thought this was the normal orientation for a new nurse at my. I didn't know what I didn't know. \n\n4 days before the end of my orientation with this preceptor we start taking patients,  starting with two and eventually three,  with me of course needing help because this is my first actual week taking patients. \n\nThose 4 days pass and now I'm sent to orient on nights with and experienced but jaded nurse.  He was told that I could handle three patients on my own. And he soon found out that,  that wasnt the case. I then I had to try and play catch up,  because I was expected to know things I weren't taught. Also having to ask the experienced jaded nurse questions became  a shot to my confidence because the response was short and with a hint of annoyance. \n\nThe end of my orientation rolls around and surprise I'm not ready to get off orientation, so my manager decides to add a few more weeks.\n\nDuring those few weeks I learned more, but  the combination of not being able to ask my preceptor as much as I wanted(I would actually ask other nurses to avoid asking him questions)  being a new grad and the basic challenges that come with that, the general isolation from the coworkers ( I was the only male of my race in the entire department), I was not successful. The confidence I came in with dwindled with each passing day,  I felt more and more incompetent as I was expected to do and know things I didn't get a chance to learn first. \n\nSo recently my manager had a meeting with me and decided that this job wasnt a good fit for me.  And I felt it coming all along. Because once my confident was shot,  I didn't move as fast, I wasn't as eager to try new things,  as I was just trying to make it through the shift. I told my manager that I agreed and she assured me she would make sure I found a place that may be better suited for me. \n\nER nursing is the only nursing I ever wanted to do. I've never been drawn to anything else. Now with my confidence crushed, I'm supposed to pick up and look for another job,  interview and explain to the hiring manager why I'm so great for a position, which will most likely be one I really don't want. \n\nI wondered if nursing is for me. Was my experience just horrible and things will be better elsewhere?  Either way I'm at lost for ideas,  because the only thing I wanted I got, but things weren't like I thought they would be when I got there. \n\nAny advice on what to do next, how should I go about this, which steps should I take in continuing my journey, or should I stop here with nursing.",

    "text": "What are some tips for better time management in your unit/specialty? For ER, some I've come to utilize are:\n\nTry to do as much of your charting on your patient as you can at once, especially if you can in the room. If you're triaging a new EMS patient in the room, try to go ahead and do your assessment and chart it as well as any of the miscellaneous protocol charting necessary. In my experience, even though I may do my first assessment then, I may not remember to chart it for hours if I try to do it outside of the room since I often get distracted. Also, try to do as focused an assessment as possible. If your charting system utilizes charting by exception, don't waste time charting assessments that are typically irrelevant for the patient's chief complaint.\n\nIt goes without saying, but try to predict what will be needed. If you can protocol orders, even better. If a woman comes in with abdominal pain, get a urine, IV, and blood ASAP.\n\nPulling meds on multiple patients at once. Obviously this one comes with several stipulations and would likely be frowned upon by the higher ups/regulatory organizations, but can be a pretty big time saver if you're getting your ass kicked. Don't put the meds into the same pocket or container where they can be mixed up, don't take one patient's meds into another pt's room who is on isolation or may be contagious, don't pull controlled substances for multiple patients at once since pharmacy keeps a close eye on controlled dispense vs. administration times.\n\nTry to waste controlled meds at the time of drawing. Having to make an extra trip to the Pyxis just to waste is a bummer and having to return to work because you accidentally went home with a forgotten vial of unwasted controlled substance in your pocket is even worse.\n\nThis may just be me, but I like to prep meds (spiking bags, drawing up vials, mixing, etc.) as much as I can in advance of entering the room. In the room, I'm usually speaking with the patient which can slow down the process of drawing up/prepping meds and make me more distracted/likely to mess something up. I've talked to others who prefer to do it in the room specifically to be able to talk with patients more.\n\nI also ask because I'm interested in more advice on time management myself. I do travel nursing and while some ERs are relatively easy and more relaxed, I also get placement in ERs where I'm running nonstop and always behind.",

    "text": "Can't we all just get along? (Long, and rambling, I apologize) Little bit of a rant, and I'm gonna own that I'm also whining a bit, so bear with me. I'm a cath lab nurse, former ICU, CVICU, & ED. Love, love, love my job! I get to make people happy every day: either we fix em and make em happy, or we get to tell them that their heart is perfect, and make em happy (for the most part, we have a few, very, very few sad endings). And NOTHING feels better than saving a STEMI pt in the middle of the night, and making such a huge difference for them! I wish more nurses would join us, we are always short staffed.  Frankly, I think most nurses are too smart to give up their 3-12s for 4 or 5-10s, plus call ;-) I get it, I really do. And when we do get a new nurse, and get her (or him) trained up, they usually leave to do travel assignments and make buckets of money, because cath labs across the country are short staffed and need travelers, it's a vicious cycle. \n\nI'm on call this weekend, and it never fails: we get called by that one nervous ED doc, and cancelled before we finish parking. No pay for our time traveling, no pay for dropping whatever we're doing at home to zoom into work within 30 minutes (I was in my pj's for 2 of my 3 calls so far this weekend, but I feel like it was a win because I remembered a bra). Again, I get it, that's the job I chose. But often, it feels like we're the unloved step children of the hospital. Or, the cardiologist basically says 'screw it, we're here, let's just do the damned thing', and we're doing a basic cath that could've waited until Monday. It might not be life-threatening, but this patient was labelled as a STEMI, and now the floor is getting nervous that they're going to have a STEMI patient that we refused to cath. Even though it wasn't even a NSTEMI, but instead, a guy going through a cardiac work up last week who got nervous waiting for his diagnostic cath next week and had an anxiety attack.  Ugh. But it's not like we can be mad. That's our job...but not really. \n\nHere's what really chaps my hide: we have been working 5 days a week since last summer, trying desperately to find RNs to replace the 4 who left. We're finally back down to 12 days of call a month, from the 20 we were doing, yay we got a traveler!  We're tired. When we get called in 3 times over the weekend, it's hard not to get frustrated by units who refuse to bring a bed to us for when we're finished, or bring the patient to us if they're in-patient, nurses who refuse to take report when we call, and House Supervisors who insist that we recover the STEMI patient because there are 'no beds'. Like, COME ON PEOPLE! \n\nWhether it's 3 am on a weeknight, or 3 pm on a Sunday, we're alone waaaaayyyy out in the cath lab area. There's just our team, and we don't all arrive at once. We have to set up the room and be ready as soon as the patient arrives, because we have a time limit to meet. 90 minutes, door to balloon, and we've already eaten up however much time it took in the ED or on the floor to get things in motion, 30 minutes getting to the hospital, another 15-20 minutes turning on equipment, setting up the room, calling for a quick report, pulling drugs, mixing meds, and throwing the table. That doesn't really leave time to transport, get the patient switched over to our table, and re-do the ekg/cuff/ETCO2/and defib patches, because it all has to be different so as not to be in the way of the xray/sine pics. At this point, the Dr might only have 20 minutes left to get access and maneuver a guide and wire into a tricky spot and balloon it before the stent goes in. 90 minutes seems like a long time, but it's not, especially when the patient's life is on the line. \n\nAfterwards, we still have to be at work the next day, 7 am as always. Or we go home to be on call for the rest of our overnight or weekend shift. When we get called in at 530 am or pm, I know we might get lucky and finish within 2 hours, and I'm sorry that you're going to change shift at 7, but when I call at 650, please don't refuse report and make me wait until 720. My patient is cold and miserable, the family is anxious, and we just want to go home! We still have to clean and mop the room and get it ready for the next STEMI, and we can't start that until the patient leaves. And the patient can't leave until I give report. I'm a good nurse and I do cate about my patient, but a STEMI is a true emergency, and I probably don't know much. I know that the pt is stable, I can tell you what meds I gave, where his IV is, where his stent is, and maybe his allergies. I will probably have to look to tell you the gauge of the IV, because shit was hitting the fan, and I only cared that the IV worked, I didn't notice the size. I can tell you that he collapsed while waiting to catch the train home, and a police officer who knows good CPR was standing right next to him, and his wife is frantic waiting to see him. That's all I got. That's all I can tell you. I won't take 2 minutes of your time, and I can transport the patient, tuck him in, and take your 1st set of vitals by the time you finish shift change. I'll even go over orders with you, and remind you how to handle a TR band if its been a while. Or, I'll ask the Dr to place a seal in the femoral artery, so you don't have to pull a sheath (and I won't get paged in 4 hours later, because you're too busy to pull it, grrrr).\n\nAnd please don't treat me, or my techs, like we're dumb. The techs in the cath lab aren't \"techs\" in the sense of the word that they're nurse helpers. No, they kinda run the cath lab world. They are highly trained in cardiology, with an RT or XRay degree, plus extra CVT training (Cardio-Vascular Technologist), or they graduated from a CVT school. They can make more money than RNs, lol, and they are often 'in charge' or the manager. They take the same credentialing test as RNs, the RCIS, which gives them the right to circulate patients. They don't do conscious sedation, that's the only difference. They can handle all the drips and meds the ICU deals with. They are ACLS certified. The Dr's rely on them to be an extra set of eyes and hands. In some facilities, they get access in the femoral artery, seal arteries, and pull or place catheters. They may even be allowed to perform most of a diagnostic cath, though that is rare these days, but that's a big ol political thing I won't get into. Just know, they are safe and smart and highly educated. They can run circles around most nurses. They don't \"assist\" me. Techs are my teammates and my equals, with more cardiovascular knowledge in their little fingers than most nurses will ever hope to have (including me, but I'm getting there, lol). And just because I couldn't give you a full head to toe report, please don't roll your eyes. I did my job with what I had. I'm not a bedside nurse anymore, and I often don't have access or time to look for any of the information you need. I think *YOU* are awesome. Please recognize that I'm still one of you, but with an extremely focused job that requires something very different from what you're able to do as a bedside nurse. \n\nSo, long story short: please recognize that while we understand the difficulty of taking a report right at shift change, or the frustration of getting another admission, my job is sometimes 24/7, and I'm ready to go home and eat my dinner 3 hours late, or see my kids, or get 2 hours sleep, before I get called in again.  I don't want to hold a patient, all alone with 1 other nurse, in a recovery area that's shut down and empty for the night or weekend, for any amount of time (yes, I have those bad-ass techs on my team, but they don't count as nurses, they can't monitor a patient after the procedure is over, only *during* a procedure. They have to clock out and leave). I came in and did my job, now I want to clock out and go home, too, before it starts all over again. I swear it's not a dump and run. We know you've got this, please take it from here asap!\n\nI'd really appreciate it if you could find a little empathy for your cath lab brothers and sisters. We don't mean to be grumpy, or pushy. We don't mean to come across as abrasive. We're probably just tired, and feeling a little bit misunderstood, unappreciated, and unloved. And I suppose we make you feel the same way, sometimes, too! As for myself, I'm the nurse who's always smiling and joking with you, because dammit, we're going to make a nursing connection whether you like it or not, and you're going to be my buddy who 'knows me', and knows that I won't ever screw you over, because I was once in your shoes, and I totally get where you're coming from! How the hell do you think I ended up in the cath lab? Became friendly with the cardiologist, one of my favorite people, became *his* go-to post-cath nurse in the ICU, then became the STEMI nurse in the ICU when we went interventional, got bamboozled by the funny, nice cath lab folks, and *boom*, let them lead me down a path straight into the cath lab. Darn them all to heck! And now I'm the CCL educator, getting new nurses from the floor who shadow me every Wednesday. (Don't even get me started on new RNs, I love them so much, getting them on-board the cath lab train, to bridge a greater team work and understanding in the years to come, is so much fun and makes me look forward to Wednesdays!)\n\nIf you're still with me, thank you for hanging in there and letting me vent and blow off a little steam. It probably didn't help that when I tried to call report today, for the 4th time, the day nurse forgot to put me on hold while she and the night nurse complained about the cath lab. I do feel a bit petty, because I was once that nurse, I hate to admit. Always feeling put upon by the specialty areas who just couldn't wait one damned minute (or 40) for me to get settled into my shift! Anyways, please understand that I just needed someone to listen, and not judge too harshly, and I'm keeping this up, though I probably shouldn't because I'm not trying to ruffle any feathers or throw shade (though maybe I did a tiny bit). I want us all to show some mutual respect, is that too much to ask? I'm going to start with me, and say that I know I couldn't do what I do, without the nurses in the ED who start the process and the nurses \"upstairs\" who take over where my job leaves off.

    "text": "Dealing with burnout/career dissatisfaction I'm having a huge problem with my current job or career satisfaction.  I'm just burnout out, I guess.  The people I work with know it.  I know it.  I'm anxious about work-related things all the time but at the same time feel detached from situations, I haven't slept well in months and months, and I guess I am getting irritable or difficult to deal with.  So anyone that has experience in this area, how did you fix it?  Change speciality areas?  Leave the profession?  Go back to school and prepare for a new career?  I'm curious about other people's experiences with this type of situation. \n\nA little about my situation: \nI have been a nurse for 15 years, 100% of that time I have worked in a 40 bed mixed ICU environment (MICU/SICU/CVICU). I've been a team lead/charge nurse for about half that time. Now at age 40, I have reached that point in my career where I feel I can't do it anymore.  I can't talk to one more condescending doctor or be hung up on (I've worked night shift the whole time, this is fairly common amongst some of our docs), deal with one more family member that demands something jaw dropping, or more ridiculousness from management. I feel like every year I'm drowning in new RN's that just come in to get their 1 year of experience for CRNA/Travel nursing/move on to day shift.  My stress levels have reached the point to where I was actually hospitalized with chest pain two months ago (completely clear cardiac workup, ruled stress induced angina). \n\nMy review of other options like med/surg, ER, OR, dialysis, etc or changing hospitals just leads me to believe I am going to be walking into the same issues, anxieties, and dissatisfaction.  NP and CRNA paths aren't appealing to me (I feel like my current responsibility level is enough to deal with).  To top it off, I live in decently sized city (600,000+) but undergoing economic depression due to the energy bust and there are not exactly a plethora of career options around, making me feel really trapped into my current situation.",

    "text": "My first code blue - meanwhile my other patient leaves hospital campus with IV access.. help! **I've been an RN for a whopping 9 months. Today I experienced my first code blue and my mind is racing about all the things that I probably (most likely?? totally??) did wrong. I work on a med-surg floor where the ratio is 1:5. Everything happened so fast, I could barely keep up. Please help give your thoughts on what I could've done better..**\n\n**0830** I am talking to my walkie-talkie patient. 56M, admitted yesterday for cirrhosis/ETOH withdrawal. Hx of portal hypertension, esophageal varices, ETOH abuse. My patient tells me he is very nauseated. I get a CIWA score of 11 and go to the pyxis to grab PRN Zofran for nausea and PRN Ativan for the CIWA score. I come back and he told me he just went to the bathroom and vomited bright red blood.  I look in the toilet, it looks to be ~100c. I textpage the MD right away and a few minutes later she arrives. Vital signs are stable. MD puts in new orders for strict NPO, GI consult, IV octreotide & IV protonix infusion. She tells me she thinks he is bleeding from his varices - she looks worried.\n\n**0845** The new med orders are still being verified by pharmacy so I pass meds for my other patient, but I ask my relief nurse to place a second IV on my patient so I can start the IV drips as soon as the new IV is in and the meds are verified. The relief nurse tells me that my patient seems more sleepy. MD tells the relief nurse that she has decided to transfer the patient to stepdown. The relief nurse draws rainbow labs to anticipate whatever labs the MD might order.\n\n**0900** The resource nurse is on our unit to assess my patient and help with the transfer to a higher level of care. While the resource nurse is taking vitals, I start the IV drips. Crash cart is in the room. The patient becomes even more sleepy and harder to arouse. I see a long list of new orders including new orders for T&S (good thing I had rainbow labs) and PRBC transfusion.\n\n**0930** The patient suddenly has a HUGE volume projectile bright red blood emesis, maybe half a liter or more all over the floor. We suction the patient, put him on oxymask, and call an RRT (rapid response team) which immediately got upgraded to a Code Blue (despite patient still breathing/heart still beating) due to likely possibility of intubation. Once the Code Blue was started it was chaos, so many people were in the room, we were moving other patients' beds out of the room (it was a 4-patient room). I felt so helpless and incompetent so I was just running up and down the hall grabbing supplies (NS bolus, soft restraints for the intubation, preparing tubing for o-neg blood, etc). I called ICU to give report. **It was very busy but by 1015 the patient was intubated and on the way to ICU.**\n\n---\n**MEANWHILE, HERE'S WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH MY OTHER PATIENT!** After the Code Blue, I learn that my other patient had left the hospital with his IV in. Patient has history of meth abuse. No one had informed me that he had left until AFTER he was gone.\n\nHere's the story behind that: the day before, the social worker and doctor told me the plan is that he will have a 1-hour pass to go to the county jail to pick up some documents in person to verify he was incarcerated in order to collect SSI. I told my assistant nurse manager this, she straight up said no to this plan because it was against hospital policy to let patients leave like that. I passed this information onto the doctor and the social worker as well as the next shift nurse to have them follow up with that.\n\nI come into work the next day and that's still the plan. And since it's the weekend, the ANM is not on the unit. The charge nurse for the day says it's ok and the doctor is adamant in the plan. I once again tell the doctor that it's not okay with the ANM, so he tells me \"Ok so I will officially discharge the patient so he can get the documents and then he can come back through the ED to get admitted again.\" 15 minutes later the doctor tells me he's gone back to the original plan and as I protest he says \"Shh - let's not talk about it.\" The charge nurse ok's the plan and transportation (from an outside agency) is made for the patient to be picked up at 1000. Meanwhile my other patient is declining rapidly (this is just a few minutes before the Code Blue starts) and I don't protest anymore so I can attend to declining patient.\n\nThen the Code Blue happens. It's over at 1015. Someone tells me, \"Hey, your patient left with transportation to the county jail.\" I freak out - I was so caught up in the Code Blue that I did not remove his IV. I let the charge nurse know, and the charge nurse seems chill about this, saying \"The transport guy will keep an eye on him, he deals with transporting difficult patients all the time.\" The patient returns at 1100, vital signs are stable, IV still patent, and he doesn't look like he's under the influence of any drugs.\n\n**Anyway. I'm sorry if this is all word vomit. I just need to know your thoughts. I'm freaking out. I come back to work on Monday and most likely my ANM will find out what happened over the weekend and I'm preparing to write my incident report.**",

What am I missing here?\n\nDR: Hey guys, regular here under a throwaway for obvious reasons. I've been an RN for over three years now and for the most part, I like my job. I work in PICU and peds and have since before school. I started off ICU and left my first job after 9 months because of toxic bitchy coworkers who talked smack about anyone outside their circle. Rest of the unit and acuity was great, but as a new grad in a stressful environment, I did not feel supported at all by my more experienced coworkers or management.\n\nWent from that job to 1 yr of primary care which was great except the clinic I worked at had never had a peds nurse and I didn't know wtf I was supposed to be doing and neither it seemed did the pediatricians. From there, went back to a small inpatient peds ward for another 1 year and constantly took care of post op OB patients which was interesting but not my forte. Changed states and did a slightly larger peds ward in an adult hospital, took up travel nursing 4 months later and did one 4 month assignment in gen peds before landing in what I hoped was gonna be my dream unit, back in a PICU. \n\nI've been at this place for almost a year now and dislike it a lot. The acuity is really mixed (traditional sick PICU kids and more step down/chronic kids alike), and I came in with experience yet seem to be getting the most boring, unchallenging patients day in and day out, despite emailing my primary charge and complaining to other charge nurses and my educator, all who say they'll work to get my higher acuity assignments, yet never do. I've asked multiple coworkers and management if my skills were prohibiting me from taking more complex assignments and everyone assures me that's not the case, yet the same people---new grads with less experience than I do--are taking more complex kids than me.\n\nNot only that, but the people on this unit, while polite are extremely distant and not really interested in becoming friendly with newer staff. This doesn't bother me as much; I seem to get along well with travelers, but those guys aren't going to be there forever.\n\nI am so fed up with changing hospitals and jobs but just can't seem to catch a break with any place that I get accepted at. Is/has anyone else experienced this or am I just looking for grass that's supposedly greener on the other side? \n\nThanks for reading!",

I am very excited but also pretty nervous as it is a much different type of nursing than I'm used to. I do very much look forward to the change of pace however--I have started to find myself getting bored with the monotony and predictability of med/surg nursing and I wanted to be proactive in switching up the scenery before my work ethic goes down from boredom. Would love to hear about other RN's transitions to ER from other specialties and what would be useful to know before I delve in! I am being a sponge for the next few months, I do not want to let any habits get in the way of me learning a new way of nursing.\n\nAlso, for those of you who left MED surg nursing for the ER, did you get flak from your coworkers about leaving? It seems I got mixed reactions from my coworkers. Some seemed upset that I'm leaving the floor, others seemed skeptical, superficially portraying support but then making it seem like I couldn't handle the faster pace or something. Oh well, haters gonna hate. At least my manager was fully supportive of me leaving.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!",

I've tried to plan for the first day and the first week. I'm thinking with my style, and what I want to accomplish, I want to do some icebreakers (maybe 2 truths and a lie), arrange in groups, lead some other activities (Marshmallow Challenge, classroom scavenger hunt), and probably start content toward the end of the first week. But I've gotten a lot of mixed advice that's overwhelming me and making me question whether what I envision isn't going to be best for me to build strong classroom management skills because that is something I struggled with during student teaching.\n\nHere's some examples of conflicts I've been told -  I've been told not to do content at all, and I've been told to start content from day 1. I've been told not to do icebreakers because they're awkward, and I've been told to do icebreakers to introduce students to each other. I've been told to arrange my desks in rows to start to establish order, and I've been told to arrange my desks in groups to establish the expectation that students are going to collaborate regularly.\n\nMy question is how does everyone begin their first days and continue through the first week, especially middle school teachers? I know a lot is based on school expectations and personal style, but I just want to get some opinions from others for me to consider as I continue to plan!\n\nEdit: I wanted to go ahead and add I've read The First Days of School and Tools for Teaching, but I want to get additional perspectives and suggestions from other professionals! 😊",

    "text": "Update to \"I think I'm in over my head\". So 6 months ago I posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4xx4ac/i_think_im_in_over_my_head/\n\nHere's a summary of my first semester in my district's alternative program:\n\nWe were 4 teachers: 3 alternative certification (no teacher training or experience) and 1 long term sub. We also had one first year Behavior Management Specialist.\n\nWe had up to 75 students. These kids are in 6-12. They come to our program for 45-180 days after expulsion hearings or when they're released from the Department of Juvenile Justice. Some are the real deal, with violent criminals history, gang affiliation, fights in school and on the bus, and they're frequently in and out of jail. Some were caught with drugs in school (weed or xanax). Some just had too many office referrals. A few have IEPs, but most are unmedicated and their IEPs are only loosely followed at best. Many more have undiagnosed LDs. Only a handful come from decent homes. \n\nThe vast majority of them are loud and uninterested in school, but most are decent, respectful kids if you treat them like human beings. Some will curse you out, but I really like almost all of them. \n\nSo they end up with us for one reason or another. And we're supposed to run a very strict, structured, highly restrictive, punitive program. It's supposed to scare them straight. It's supposed to feel like jail. We have 4 blocks, 4 teachers, and 4  mixed classes. One middle school, one mixed middle and high, and two high school, all with kids in different classes.\n\nMy certification is for MS Social Studies and History and HS History (NOT Social Studies). I have students who are supposed to be doing everything from US History and Constitution to 7th grade World History. If they're actually assigned a social studies class. Many are supposed to be working on things like Health, ROTC, Spanish, Economics, Marketing, Law Education, Art, and Earth Science in my class. I don't speak Spanish. I'm not certified to teach any of those things. Even if I just follow the curriculum, I have 16 other kids in other classes I'm supposed to be teaching at the same time. Even when I have a couple kids in the same class, they're in vastly different places in the curriculum.\n\nThe kids all have tablets. They're supposed to work on Edgenuity, which aligns with the classes in their home schools and should keep them on track if they're self-motivated enough to keep up. None of them are. It's a boring, unengaging, tedious program that shows videos, asks questions, and then quizzes them. Endlessly. They do this in all 4 blocks every day, with a 20 minute break for lunch.\n\nThe principal says to do enrichment, too. Blended learning, she says. But I can't expect my social studies kids to be cool with a whole bunch of extra work that I'm not qualified to give to the Spanish kids. And I can't give enrichment that doesn't directly relate to the Edgenuity lesson each kid is currently doing. I can't take away from the time they could be completing their Edgenuity if I can't offer a direct substitute for the lesson. And I can't do that.\n\nSo we expect these kids to sit from 9 to 3. And I mean sit. They are not to get up. They are not offered any activity ever (which goes really well for the 7th graders). They are not to use their tablets for anything else, ever. They are **absolutely not allowed to listen to music, ever**. They have no freedom to move at all. They must be accompanied to the bathroom in twos, so I can't just take the whole class. They are not allowed water bottles, and cannot get water on their own.\n\nUltimately, it's a huge academic setback. The kids with minor behavior issues end up getting worse, and the kids with serious behavior issues don't get any better.\n\nThen there's our admin. Remember that were three first year alternative certification teachers, a LTS, and a first year BMS. We are very isolated, even from our principal. She's on the other side of the building, through the district office. Our AP was about 45 months pregnant all of last semester, and spent most of her time on the other side with the principal. This left us alone. Very, very alone. We do not do searches. Kids can't bring backpacks, but we don't search and there's no metal detector. Oh, we're also the only school in the district without a resource officer.\n\nWe were having discipline issues (surprise). Principal told us it was because we weren't doing enough, weren't doing our jobs, and she wouldn't do disciplinary stuff until we did. Ha.\n\nWe would call for help, and it would take 10 minutes, minimum, for someone to come help us. If the kids attacked a teacher and took over the class, nobody would know for at least 40 minutes, and up to 2 hours. Even then, what's our very pregnant AP going to do?\n\nWe've never had a fire drill. My room has only 1 door and no windows.\n\nOur SPED teacher is often off campus at the vocational school (which is attended by only the most hopeless students). This leaves IEP kids with IEPs that aren't being followed.\n\nWe've begged for PE. Nothing.\n\nWe've begged for a resource officer. Nothing.\n\nWe've begged for radios. Nothing.\n\nWe've begged for a planning period. Nothing.\n\nThis program is a disgrace. It's a holding tank for the kids the district doesn't want on their expulsion record but doesn't want in real classes. They're waiting for these kids to drop out or get locked up. It's cruel and horrible, and I'm putting in for a transfer.\n\nBut I love the kids, and I love my co-workers, and I know I'm going to love a real classroom.\n\nSo that's it. It's awful, but not because of the kids, and not because of me.",

    "text": "[Southern USA] [Kindergarten] - Please help with class management! Throwaway account, because I'm paranoid of someone in my school finding me. Also posted in /r/ECEProfessionals \n\nI am a second-year teacher at a rural, 90% African American school in the southern United States. I'm having issues with classroom management. Last year, my assistant was very strong- she basically ran my whole classroom. Whenever the kids were being too loud, she'd sternly redirect them to pay attention. Sometimes she even yelled, but it worked. I am not a confrontational person and her methods worked, so I ran with it. She was African American, and told me that her ways were effective because the kids saw her as a mom/grandma figure and respected her. I believe this to be true. However, she has retired and I have a new assistant- an older white lady who is not as strong of a personality.\n\nIn this community, the norm is for children to be scolded/punished for doing wrong things. The ways that some of the other teachers talk to their students align to this method of child-rearing, because culturally they are similar to their students (again, the kids see the teacher as a mom/grandma). I should mention here that I am white. I have been told by the other kinder teacher (and several other friends within the school) that if I spoke to the kids the way the other teachers might, I would be in trouble because \"Black people don't want to see their kids yelled at by a white teacher\". That is a direct quote, please don't call me a racist or tell me that race doesn't matter.\n\nThe issue is that I cannot get the kids to stay quiet or pay attention, even if I raise my voice (which I hate to do). I also feel like they are goofing off when we are supposed to be working. My kids are turning in absolute crap- I know they are capable of better work. When I try to get them to be quiet, they still talk or play at their tables and do half-assed work. I would love to be able to allow them to whisper at their tables about what we are doing (and generally work together in teams), but it seems like the majority of them are always off-task. I try to plan active activities/group work/movement into our day. I also allow them to talk during breakfast and snack.\n\nWe have a school-wide management system using a 'green, yellow, red' behavior chart. If a kid misbehaves, I'll warn them. If they repeat, I'll change their color. I've thought about starting some kind of token-based economy, but at this point I'm not sure they'd be quiet or attentive long enough for me to tell them about it.\nI've tried all the positive behavior things we learn in college, like highlighting kids that are doing what is expected, etc. We made our class rules together. All the positive/reinforcing/'let's talk about your choices' stuff doesn't work. Changing their colors doesn't work. Having them practice walking in the hallway quietly (because we can't seem to do that correctly, either) doesn't work. None of it seems to work. I'm frustrated and upset and not sure what else to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "Starting my 2nd year teaching English at an alternative school. Very anxious. Any advice? At the end of the month I will begin my 2nd year teaching English at an alternative school. The students I teach all have behavioral issues and most are on IEPs. My first year was a bit of a mixed bag in terms of my performance. I felt for the first three quarters of the year I did a somewhat decent job with classroom management and felt very comfortable with the curriculum. The last quarter was incredibly difficult for me as the students began to take advantage of my cool, calm, collected approach and while I do place some blame on myself, the school was incredibly unhelpful as just about every time I needed to send a student out of my classroom no one was around to A) receive my call or B) receive the student that needed to be removed. Eventually I had two physical incidents between students in my classroom very late in the school year. As a result I was called in for a meeting with some of the higher ups in my school/ program during the final week of the school year and was told I would be placed on a 60 day classroom management program where my progress would be evaluated. The details of which were painfully vague. I was also told that if I felt that this position wasn't for me that it would be a good idea to \"see what else is out there.\" I thought this decision was completely unjustified and the comment about seeing what else might be out there was very insulting. In fact I did see what other jobs were out there, specifically something in a regular school district, but my search hasn't yielded results. You can see why I might be a little anxious heading into this 2nd year.\n\nSome things that I have been doing so far this summer include reading The First Days of School by Harry Wong and Never Work Harder Than Your Students by Robyn Jackson. I'm really trying to focus on having a clean year in terms of classroom management. My goal by the end of this year is to be completely confident in my management style and successfully implementing the curriculum in my classroom. I'm looking for some general advice from other teachers in terms of classroom management and lesson plan ideas/ resources. I'm not so much anxious about the start of the year as I am about later in the year when the number of students we have at our school starts to get very high usually after winter break. I should also mention that I teach grades 6-12, though our number of middle schoolers seems to increase greatly with each year. I ran into trouble last year trying to balance what material to teach to what grades considering having separate lesson plans for my middle school classes, grade 9, 10, 11, and 12 can be very daunting when I'm doing something different with each class.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to any advice you can give!",

    "text": "23 marketing grad, can't stand sales, thoughts on recommended new roles? Throwaway because current coworkers know my reddit username.\nI am one year removed from graduating from a state university with a major in Marketing and a minor in Computer science. Internship experience during school focused mainly on IT with some marketing mixed in.\n\nCurrently, I am in a sales role at a marketing technology company in Boston. I make good money for what I do ($50k base), but it's not enough to make up for the dread I experience every morning waking up to go to work. This is going to be a bit of a vent session, so bear with me, lol:\n\nI love the company I'm with. Everyone I work with is intelligent and helpful and the product we make, although nearly impossible to sell, is interesting and useful.\n\nThat being said, I fucking hate sales, so, so, much. I can't stand how mind numbing prospecting is. I can't stand how even if I'm so very fortunate to get on someone's calendar, I'm always just the \"sales guy\". My time is never valued externally. Our sales cycle is 6-12 months. This creates an environment with very little gratification and constant head-banging.\n\nI am a person who likes to create, I like to DO things. I like to be busy. This may be pompous but I genuinely believe I'm too skilled and smart to be drafting 50 emails a day to people who couldn't be bothered to read them. Or reciting the same damn sales pitch every time I do get a meeting.\n\nWhen I want to get something tangible done, like when I'm modifying my car, or writing an essay, or even just cleaning my house, I work with passion and typically have and end result I can look at and be proud of. I can't stand coming into work, sending a myriad of emails, maybe taking a meeting or two, and having nothing to show for it.\n\nI feel my brain isn't being worked and I'm not learning new things, so I've been looking into moving on. While the idea of moving on excites me greatly, I have found it more difficult than expected to answer the question of \"so you've just worked a job you hate for a year, what would be a job that you would LIKE?\".\n\nThis paragraph should be where I go into a bit about myself: I'm a tinkerer, a creator, a builder. I like to get dirty and do the irregular and solve problems. I wanted to be an engineer but was never good enough at the math. Then I wanted to be a computer scientist but programming just didn't come naturally to me. I fell into marketing and came to genuinely enjoy analyzing and solving business problems.\n\nWhen I graduated, a marketing position seemed natural. But in Boston with a state school degree in town of Harvard, MIT, and the like, I found it near-impossible to land a decent entry-level marketing/advertising gig, so I settled for sales.\n\nI've learned valuable things about marketing technology, but the field, and sales, are something I could never be passionate about. I enjoy, and am good at, talking to people, but I just don't solve problems like I did in school. My brain feels like it's turning to mush.\n\nI've looked at business analyst roles, although those are very competitive. The same can be said about the marketing coordinator roles I've applied for. I hold out hope but need other options. I am passionate about renewable energy, the outdoors, sports, anything with an engine, writing, and fixing things. I'm hoping you were a saint enough to read down to here and give me some advice on some roles I should be on the lookout for that will allow me to have a more gratifying and impactful career, all while managing to still pay my rent every month.\n\nBoston is booming right now, and I'm hopeful because the opportunities are boundless. But that is both a blessing and an overwhelming curse. Do you have any recommendations for things I should be typing in that LinkedIn/Indeed search bar?",

I'm getting ready to graduate with a degree in engineering, and I've been pretty unhappy with it, so I've been looking for something else. I finally found a common theme in some of my hobbies/childhood interests and thought I'd see if anyone could help connect the dots and suggest some related career paths:\n\n1. When I was younger, I really wanted to own and manage a horse racing stable. The two things I liked most about it were the horses (I love animals) and the \"operations\" side of it. I like the idea of managing the schedules of the horses, training plans, travelling, etc.\n\n2. I play this computer game called \"Football Manager\" pretty avidly. (Google it if you aren't familiar with it, but it's a fairly realistic soccer-managing game.) I enjoy the spreadsheets, the data, managing/tracking players throughout their careers, etc.\n\n3. In the sports I play now, I'm not the best player, but I'm good at leading and almost coaching my teammates. I like helping others succeed like that.\n\n4. I really like the idea of being a small (or large) business owner someday. Just haven't figured out the field.\n\n5. I'm a very active person. I can't sit at a desk all day, but I also don't want to be in a manual labor position all day everyday. I'd like a career where every day looks a little different and there's a decent balance of teamwork, independent work, hands on, paper work, etc.\n\n6. I fully recognize that jobs almost always require sacrificing some of our \"wants\" and I'm definitely willing to do that.\n\nYeah, I don't know how helpful that is. I can answer questions that might help. Thanks for reading!",

    "text": "I think my boss is a fucking idiot and I'm not sure what to do Throwaway because my friends know my real account.\n\nAnyway, I started working for this company 3 years ago, when I first started working there I had a really nice and intelligent boss who taught me a lot. He taught me that coding style matters and there is much more to programming than just having a working binary at the end of the day. For reference, I was mostly just doing embedded C, C++, and a bit of python. \n\nHowever after a while I got bored of doing the same thing everyday, so a few months ago I switched teams. The new team was doing cloud development and I thought it would be an interesting area to get into. Shortly after I joined, the manager of the team left to be a manager for a different department at my company. My company has extremely low employee turnover, they generally try their hardest to keep everyone (and they also pay incredibly).\n\nThe new manager was the senior developer on the team and basically started the project as a demo a year ago. He basically wrote about 80% of the code, my company hired a few other developers 5 months ago, and I switched teams 2 months ago. Here's the lowdown on the project:\n\n* The majority of the code is written in Java, which is good in my opinion.\n* About 20% of the code is written in bash, mostly all the configuration parsing and deployment logic, basically everything that is not Java is bash (less than  5% of the code is non-bash and non-java). \n* Almost every variable in bash is exported meaning basically every variable is global and the code cannot be made modular at all.\n* There is absolutely no coding style, almost every file is mixed between spaces and tabs. The bash scripts and yaml files tend to be 2 spaces, java tends to be 4 spaces and tabs mixed. The other files (perl, python, ruby) seem to be mostly 4 spaces, but depends on who wrote them.\n* I asked my boss about coding standards during our daily meetings and he said we're supposed to be 4 spaces, but he continually commits files with tabs.\n* We have a bunch of junit tests which we manually run for integration/regression testing (which is good in my opinion).\n* He refuses to set up automated testing using those junit tests because he thinks it will take too long to setup. As a result I have to spend a few hours everyday figuring out who broke the build.\n* The automated tests routinely fail for no apparent reason and I blame that entirely on his reluctance to actually fix anything. If he is able to run the tests several times and they all pass at least once each, then he considers that to be a good load, despite having various tests routinely fail.\n* The other developers routinely commit stuff without testing all the cases and which sometimes breaks my workflow, but I feel this could be fixed with automated testing and better infrastructure.\n* He merges stuff without testing it, which results in everything being broken all the time\n* He gets mad at me for not knowing stuff despite nobody having given me the knowledge beforehand. My other coworkers generally don't know enough to be of any use in most cases.\n* He has occasionally commit files after merging that are only partially merged (literally full of >>>>> ====== <<<<<), and therefore unusable.\n* He was surprised when one of the bash input parameters, that was input as \"var=$VARIABLE_NAME\" came out as \"var=\" (I'll give you a hint, he doesn't know how to escape in bash properly).\n* He doesn't know how to write generic code, which results in him copying and pasting the same function about 20 times with slight differences.\n* He uses tons of magic numbers, never uses final (which is the java equivalent of const), never comments and rarely documents, uses strings for things that could be enums, and uses way too many public functions (in my opinion)\n* He thinks I waste too much time reading documentation and constantly gets mad at me for it. (maybe I spend 15% of my time reading documentation despite being new)\n* He doesn't like it when we try to improve our internal tools, since we don't sell those tools to customers and therefore they aren't worth making very good\n* As a result, our internal tools suck and constantly break which results in large amounts of wasted time. They also aren't remotely helpful if you do something slightly wrong (such as forget or misspell a parameter) which occasionally means digging through log files to figure out what you did wrong.\n* None of the internal tools have sane defaults, and to work they generally require all of: setting environment variables, changing a configuration file, and passing command line arguments\n* Whenever he runs into any timing issue he can't solve within a few minutes, he adds a bunch of sleeps. This results in everything taking forever and occasionally still not working because he didn't  actually fix the underlying problem.\n* He easily works 80 hour weeks (because he works nights and weekends) and I feel he resents us for not working as \"hard\" as him\n* His variable and function names are mixed between snake case (function_that_does_work) and camel case (functionThatDoesWork), even in the same file.\n* He \"checks up on me\" multiple times a day (and probably my coworkers too) which results in me feeling anxious all the time because he low-key guilt trips me about not working as much as him.\n* He constantly rushes us, despite us being ahead of schedule as far as I'm aware\n* Everyone else on the team works from home several times a week, probably to get away from him.\n* He constantly says the phrase \"time to market\" as if it will summon the god of capitalism or something\n* He admits there are problems but says we can fix them later, which results in me thinking he just loves technical debt since there is absolutely no plan to fix any of the issues.\n\nI'm not sure what to do. Should I talk to his manager about how horrible he is, or just find a new job? Or am I just a big whiner?\n\nIt's worth mentioning I've only had great bosses before this guy, maybe that's spoiled my opinion of software development management.\n\nMore minor things:\n\n* He touches my screen all the time despite me asking him not to\n* He points at my screen and says \"SEE WHAT THIS DOES\" despite me not being able to see because his hand is in the way\n* He gets mad because I can't read the code since his hand is in the way (no I'm not kidding).\n\nI think he's way too tired and he doesn't realize other people have a different perspective than him (literally and figuratively).",

    "text": "My experience interning at a proprietary trading firm this summer This summer I interned at a pretty good (in my opinion) prop shop in the trading division. I'm a CS major at a decent school. Currently a rising junior. Won't say which firm for privacy reasons.\n\n**disclaimer: the thoughts below are based on my isolated experience at ONE trading firm this summer, and from talking to traders/upper management at the company **\n\n**Overall Experience**\n\nThe internship program at any good trading firm should have some mix of learning, trading, and side projects. We spent a few weeks sitting in a class room learning theory, products that the firm trades, mock trading, etc. As the teaching winded down, we got assigned projects for different desks to work on. Being a CS major I requested a more programming-focused project. Finally, we traded live on the market (CFTC, no Series 57 required).\n\n**Thoughts about the industry**\n\nTrading isn't for the feint of heart. The stuff I heard about high-pressure and getting fired if you fuck up are true based on my experience here. Even as interns we were constantly watched and assessed and criticized for getting things wrong. There was a day when one of the newer hires messed up and lost the firm quite a bit of money. It's an open office so you can hear across desks. I remember the head of the group that guy was in was going off on him. The next day he was gone. To be fair, the guy actually lost quite a bit of money. But to be chilling one day and then not have a job the next is pretty crazy - i don't think you see that much in the CS industry.\n\nIf you're good, you'll make lots of money. The firm I am at this summer pays very well. The first year comp is MUCH higher than the numbers posted on Glassdoor. The all-in comp for a first-year trader excluding performance bonuses is greater than the ones I've seen at any big-4 (except maybe the higher FB ones that the return interns get). If you are a high-performer, your all-in comp easily exceeds 200K+. What surprised me the most was how high the base salary was. I thought the base salary would be <100K but was surprised when I was told it  was well above that. (I didn't intern at jane street for those wondering)\n\nSome of the senior guys are making upwards of 500K to 1M per year. Keep in mind volatility has been extraordinarily low for the last year; apparently you make 2-3x more when the market goes to shit. Going to a trading firm during a recession is a gold mine because the firm makes so much more money.\n\nThe hours aren't bad either. As an intern I never worked more than 12 hours in a day, with the average being ~8.5 to 9 hours. Most traders also work pretty normal hours - you trade when the market is open, work on projects/chill after it closes, and leave. Some traders literally work 6 hours a day and fuck around the rest. If you're profitable no one cares how much you work, and you make a boatload of money with it.\n\n**thoughts about trading**\n\nYou might be wondering how you can get into this industry. To prepare for interviews I'd suggest getting really good at mental math, probability, pattern recognition, and brain teasers. Practice on arithmetic.zetamac.com and tradertest.org. I was surprised how much mental math you actually use on the job; if you get tested on that during the interview there's a good reason for it. Keep in mind this is for discretionary trading. Algorithmic and quant trading are different and require more programming and math skills.\n\nI'm happy to answer questions people might have - I know there's not a lot of information out there about prop trading.",

    "text": "Currently an SDET in training, getting paid extremely well. Worth it to quit and train to be an SDE? I've been working at a big software company for a few years now. PM type work, with a little QA mixed in. I'm getting paid ~150k after all is said and done.\n\nI've been interested in coding for a while and taught myself all the basics over the last 2 years or so. I expressed this interest to my manager, and since I already had background in our QA processes, he said I could take the open SDET position that recently became available. I took it, and maintained my current salary. I've been training/transitioning for the last month or so.\n\nFrom speaking to SDE friends at other companies, it seems like the SDET role, either in general or just at my company, kind of sucks in comparison. The training i've been getting is poor/non-existent. I've had to research everything myself, and it seems like SDET material is much more sparse than SDE material. I've been told that StackOverflow can answer almost any question I have, and if not it will be in some blog. Well I've been searching for questions related to the automation work i have to do, and there are often just no results. It's made it incredibly hard to learn.\n\nThe work itself also seems much less interesting. I really enjoy testing things, but the vast majority of work i've done is researching libraries/frameworks and setting them up. Coding the actual tests has been pretty straightforward and took much much less time than anything else. As an SDET, I hop around from project to project setting everything up. From what i've heard, in the SDE world this isn't the case until you get much higher up. My friends have said that for the first few years of work they spent the majority of their time coding, as the frameworks/libraries were chosen/setup by someone more senior, or just years ago before they started working on their project, since they tend to stick with a single project instead of hopping around.\n\nIf what i've heard is true, I think an SDE position is more interesting than an SDET role. The problem is, I have no idea how I would change. I could quit my job, take some classes/self study and find a new one, but i'd be going into it as a junior and would expect a 50% paycut. That's pretty steep. I could see about transferring internally, but the problems with that:\n\n* I just started transitioning to SDET. I think this would cause a lot of tension, since I already left my previous team to become an SDET which ruffled some feathers already. Trying to leave again would definitely cause some issues.\n* I have QA experience, but nothing relevant to an SDE role. I don't think I could pass the internal interview. I would need to spend time studying after work, but I don't have any time for that. I could push and find a little time, but it would take probably a year to learn enough to pass the interview (our SDE interviews are pretty tough, and they don't go much easier when doing so internally)\n\n\nI don't really know what advice i'm looking for specifically, but i'm hoping some people here have some for me. Are my assumptions about the differences between SDE and SDET correct? If so, what's the best way to transition to an SDE? Do I just need to suck it up and take a 50% pay cut?",

    "text": "How to compete to folks without kids? SFBA, 30+, senior software engineer. Salary ~180K\n\nI found that many folks who don't have kids have competitive advantage in Silicon Valley. They can afford to stay up to 8-9pm and come back to work next day by 8am. They don't have kids, and if you got one, you're screwed. You have to compete with those, who have no obligations, who are crazy enough in their 20-25 to stay and work for long hours.\n\nIt's totally unhealthy for them, but seems like managers like it (of course they do). They always compare you to them. For example, on one of company events one guy was mentioned because he was staying for long hours. Everyone applauded. I also noticed they also have promotions more often.\n\nShould I say f*ck the system, go to rural area, get myself half of my current salary, and ignore tech hub? Want to live healthy life, seems like rat race is not for me.\n\nI also feel like one day they can say \"good bye\" to me because they'll hire another no-kids with less experience for less money, s/he will be more motivated, because they can afford a room vs apartment, eat unhealthy food, staying at work late hours, and they don't need to pay for kindergarten and other stuff families pay for.\n\nI'm good for now, because I have something to put on the table (experience). But how folks without too much experience and kids survive?",

    "text": "At a big fork in my internship *Short background: I'm a paid intern at a cyber security company. I make $12/hr and work 20 hrs/wk, and I'm the only person in my department, which is a mix of marketing, graphic design, and web development (front and back end).*\n\n*I have a direct supervisor (in charge of all the interns, I'll call them B), an indirect supervisor (is an intern but gets paid more, works more, and has more responsibilities than the rest of us, I'll call them C), and the senior VP of the company (I'll call them A).*\n\nContinuing on that, I've just been assigned with redesigning the company website, strictly front end. After digging around the existing website, however, I managed to talk the company into getting a completely new website, front and back end (to be fair, the previous website was awful and I wasn't going to be able to make any changes to it). Shortly after this assignment, A left on business, and will be gone for two more weeks. Starting on this assignment, I've realized it's a lot more work than I thought. I wouldn't say I'm in over head, but it's far from $12/hr work.\n\nI have a couple of options at this point:\n\n* Ask for a raise. After speaking with C, he told me he asked for a raise when he took on more responsibilities, and was bumped to $15/hr, 30 hrs/wk. This is nice, and being a college intern I can't complain about $15/hr, but I feel it's not enough for the work I'm doing.\n    * I would have to wait until A gets back, meaning I would either do nothing for two weeks or do two weeks of underpaid work.\n    * If needed, I could probably bring an ultimatum to the table, but I enjoy working for the company and would rather not be a dick.\n    * Also, if needed, I could do the underpaid work and keep the site hostage, only offering to give them the work if I got the raise. Huge dick move though.\n* Ask for help. B is in charge of hiring new interns, and all it would take is my asking/recommendation to get more people in my department. Since this is an internship though, the coworkers I'd get would be college kids, and I think they may not be able to help as much as I'd like.\n* Reject the project? Not sure how happy people would be about that, but I'm an intern, and I think this is way above intern work.\n* Leave. Bad choice, not gonna happen, but it's an option, and there are other companies that are hiring that would hire me.\n\nOn top of all of that, C's put in their notice, and is in the process of leaving, moving to a different state. B has told me in secret that they're planning on leaving as well, moving to a different company if they get hired (A doesn't know about this). The company is small (maybe 10-12 people, and 4 of them were hired less than a month ago), and I feel like I might have a shot at B's job, but it's a cyber security company - not a web dev company, which is what I want to do. I'm not sure if I want to pursue a promotion at what I consider kind of a dead end job. One of the companies that I mentioned was hiring is a UX/UI company, hiring actual web developer interns. I think this would be a better job for me, but I don't want to screw over a company that I like and that has treated me well.\n\nSorry for ranting, I know it's a lot, but I'd appreciate any advice, on any part of it.",

    "text": "Need Career Advice - CPA & CFE With 8 Year of Experience Hi all,\n\nI’m looking for some career advice as to what I should do next. I’m a 29-year-old CPA and CFE (Just passed the CFE last week) with 8 years of experience. I was in public accounting for four years doing a mixture of tax and audit for two regional firms (Fuck the big 4). I was a senior accountant and analyst for a healthcare startup for 2 years. Currently, I’m a controller for a small private equity firm that specializes in commercial and residential real estate. It’s a property management company that oversees numerous properties that are held under 40 different taxable entities. Each entity has at least one bank account which means we perform about 75 bank reconciliations a month. Riveting, I know. Basically, I oversee and perform everything accounting and finance related. \n\nI was originally hired by the CFO but he quit in February 2017 to become a CEO for another company. I took over his role and had a coworker promoted to accounting manager. Now it’s me (Controller), an accounting manager, an AP clerk and an AR clerk with some other analysts and admin staff mixed in. \n\nThe CFO acted as a boss, a mentor and a friend. He was constantly teaching and training me. As a result, I learned a great deal of knowledge. However, since he has departed, my learning has flat lined and I’m essentially going through the motions and babysitting the company. I’m afraid that if I stay here much longer, I’ll get technically behind and never make that leap to be a CFO/COO/Executive somewhere else. I don’t know if I should try to get my MBA, CMA or another certification? \n\nThe primary issues are that it’s a family business that is never going to grow, they don’t treat or invest in their employees (everyone is disposable), taking days off is frowned upon and I’m essentially an adult baby sitter. Additionally, I don’t have much say in the decision-making process. I turn 30 in February and kinda freaking out ha ha.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "Reflections on ACN versus MBB About me: spent over 4 years in ACN strategy after undergrad and was highly rated throughout.  Left just after being promoted to Manager for an MBA in the Chicago area.  Turned down the ACN return offer and took a full-time offer with an MBB.  I've now been at my MBB here over a year and am about to be promoted back to manager level.  Really happy with my decision overall.\n\ntldr: MBB is better than ACN.  That said, I enjoyed my time at ACN (couldn't be where I am without them, they gave me my first shot after all), still have a lot of friends there, and still think of my career counselor as a mentor.  But, if you want to do consulting, there's no reason why you wouldn't want to do it at MBB.\n\n**What's the same**\n\n- The day-to-day work:  The gist of what you do is pretty much the same.  Solve problems, build models, deal with people.  For example, I built a model recently that was pretty much a duplicate of a model I built back at ACN.  I put together a deck on change management that is very similar to what ACN does and the Partner loved it.\n \n- The travel: Yeah, it still sucks.  Still flying economy, still staying at a Westin, still renting from Avis.  Per diem's a little more generous, but then again, I don't get to keep what I don't spend, so it balances out.\n\n- The starting pay is pretty much the same\n\n**What's better**\n\n- The projects: MBB has clients that at ACN we could only dream about.  Where we have the same clients, the MBB projects are with more senior clients, the projects themselves are more interesting, and the stakes are higher (on average, obviously).  The mix of projects is also more skewed towards interesting things like strategy, deals, marketing, etc.  More than at ACN, what you're doing is meaningful for the company and there is something major at risk based on your recommendations.  Best of all, there's ZERO IT implementation projects that some Partner is trying to disguise as MC.  I remember so many people being pissed off when they got bait and switch'd... one of my best friends at ACN quit when a \"Product Strategy\" gig turned into managing the error resolution log for some shitty tablet.  Also, I never had bench issues at ACN, but know that a lot of people did - this isn't an issue at MBB.  Also, never have I felt like I was rubber stamping something.  Never have I had a partner push us to try to change numbers so he could go sell some other project.\n\n- Client relationships:  I feel like at ACN, we were mercenaries and hired guns.  For a lot of clients, we would come in, do some work, leave and have no idea when we would come back (on the Strategy side, obviously on the tech side it's different).  Even on the diamond clients.  MBB really feels like partners with the client.  In a weird parasitic way.  I guess because the clients are often higher up, but we've been working with some people for years and years on different topics.  We really have a pulse on what's going on in a company, the problems they're going to face, and because of that, there's a level of trust that I never saw at ACN.\n\n- Grunt work: there's just no comparison.  You can tell that MBB has been doing this for decades.  At ACN I spent hours and hours of my day doing research, trying to find free excerpts of research reports because the team was too cheap to buy them, Googling images of charts that hopefully appeared in a newspaper or something.  Now?  there's a whole team that does the research for me.  If I see a report I need, I can just buy it.  And don't get me started on comparing ACN's garbage fire of a KX.  Or slide creation.  At ACN I spent so much time making slides, tweaking slides, making them client ready.  QPT or whatever they call it now is shit.  At my firm now, I just draw stuff out, send it to the slide people, and beautiful slides the next morning.  It's incredible - hours and hours of my day freed up just from these two things.\n\n- The pay scale: it's a lot steeper at my MBB than it would have been at ACN.\n\n- Exit opportunities: I can't think of any of my ACN friends leaving to jobs where I'm like, \"damn, I wish I got that.\"  That happens weekly here.  \n\n**What's worse**\n\n- Hours: I probably worked 50 hours at ACN, now I work 60 hours.  I guess 10 more hours doesn't sound like much, but you really feel it.  Plus, it's always gogogogo... at ACN you could easily just take a break here and there - now I feel like there's just no downtime.\n\n- The competition: At ACN, I felt like I could put in 70% effort and still do really well.  Now, I feel like putting in 100% is just average.  On average, the people at MBB are just smarter, or work harder, or worse, both.\n\n- The 'kool-aid': At ACN, I never did any extracurics and it didn't make any difference - still got high ratings.  Now, I feel like I *have* to do stuff like help plan the holiday party or do white papers, etc.  It's not work, but it's still work.  It's time I rather use for something else.",

    "text": "Going for shorter sexier projects or longer more stable projects EDIT: Thanks for your advice so far. Should have been more clear in the post, but I agree the best option would be a good mix of the two paths. However, my office is not big, and people tend to stick to one of those two types of projects here, hence I feel like once I start \"choosing\" one path or another, it will lead me to kind of specialize in one area. So i can either be a true strategic consultant in a way that business school students dream about but get incredibly stressed out in the process, not to mention higher chance of getting bad reviews and not making it to the next level, or find longer term projects that are significantly more boring but more confidence that i can be a consistent high performer. \n\nI know it all depends on my risk tolerance, how long i would like to stay in consulting and others, but would love to hear opinions based on personal experience, from people who have been at similar crossroads. Gracias!\n\n=================\n\nWould like advice on the crossroad i am at right now. \n\nBackground: Joined an mbb office (non-US) right after undergraduate program, and i have been working at this firm for more than two years now. I have worked with two types of projects since i joined... Shorter highly strategic projects which usually involve increasing revenue / sales, vs. longer projects that are very structured, functional, like transforming a supply chain system top to bottom. Senior managers and colleagues tend to \"specialize\" on one type of projects, and i am at a position where i know people from both aisles pretty well, and have some control over where i would like to take my career. The two options come with pros and cons:\n\nPath one - shorter strategic work\n\nPros: problems i am solving are cooler. C-level execs of my clients recognize my face. Experience is very diversified, i have lots of cool stories (and meaningful impact driven bits) to talk about with colleagues and interviewers. Would most likely lead to cooler exit options. \n\nCons: hours are bad and unpredictable. Higher ups on these projects tend to have little patience and regards for personal life. I get worse reviews on these projects than the ones i get from longer projects since expectation is higher. Work is a lot more stressful in general. People who sell these projects have tons of proposals going on, so being part of this group means i have to put in a ton of efforts on non billable work like proposals. Projects also feel high risk, as screwing one thing big can screw a career over. \n\nPath two - longer projects focused on functional expertise\n\nPros: hours are manageable. People smile more and are pleasant under each other more often due to lower level of stress. I get better reviews since expectation seems lower. I develop knowledge that is very tangible, something that i can talk about for hours. People in this group look to be open to staying in the firm longer, unlike Group A where a lot of burnt out people take exits all the time. This group seems to have more people who truly care about others' development vs. the other group which has more competitive gunners. \n\nCons: projects can sometimes be boring. May be a bit slow and uninteresting. Seems superstars of my firm are mostly aligned to the other group... Exit options out of this group seem worse. \n\nThank you for your advice.",

    "text": "Building out our startup's COO level planning, process and people architecture (process mapping, inventory of my people, pillar by pillar metrics, etc.) Hey y'all. \n\n**Quibbl is an early stage startup.** We are trying to make a big dent in the news aggregation space by borrowing from fantasy sports adn markets to create user-sourced aggregation system that uses a competitive game like dynamic where users compete to earn credibility by correctly predicting the outcomes to news events and trends, allowing us to use credibility as the basis for crowd sourcing. \n\nCheck it out. Quibbl.me - go make your bets on Game of Thrones, ACHA & sports stuff\n\n\n**Fair enough**\n\nWe were Y Combinator finalists this year, and though we have a long ways to go, we have been making great strides building out a top-notch tech team, going to our users and collecting massive product feedback & building out a media & content team that is beggining to produce some really cool stuff.\n\nThere's just one problem. We are growing too fast and our organizational infrastructure is a mess.\n\n**Personally, i would feel like we were in a good place if we had the following locked down:**\n\nVision:\nTeam formation & team context:\nProcesses / playbooks\nProcedures \nWorkflow management\nKnowledge library / file storage\nTalent library (who are our people, contact info, expectations, legal docs, individual expectations, training, key meetings they need to attend, etc. - also what our our current talent gaps, where are the bottlenecks and what roles do we have unfilled, etc.)\n\n**However this is the current state\"**\n\n\n**Vision:** we have a pretty clear verbal roadmap, some basic power points that convey it. I think for onboarding the team and keeping people in sync at the org levle, we are pretty okay. HOWEVER, for places where the devil is in the details (the specific tradeoffs we want to make for user acquisition strategy, detailed requirements for our analytics engine and detailed product feedback requirements, those exist in various documents, are subject to interpretation and the subject of a lot of unnecessary friciton and guessing. In won't come over night, but i'd like to have a clearer book of \"standards\" (could basically function as a 10 page appendix of 1 page memos covering our \"vision standards\" to a level of granularity that reflects what's needed to make our typical business decisions and ensure good integration across teams\n\n**Team formation & team context:** as we onboard new teammembers, we have a pretty good oral process, that gives a good overview of the teams, their book of work, how they fit together etc. But it's inefficient (relies on me to tell each person what's going on in the company, and subject to me being on and their recall). Starting to flesh out the core onboarding document to give a 2-3 page overview of each team's responsibilities, current context and book of work. Meantime, trying to develop a more granular and standard questionnaire so every month i meet with a team we use it as a forcing mechanism to get everyone in sync on what we are doing and how pieces fit together.\n\n**Processes / playbooks:**  one of the biggest problems with onboarding new people is people run into walls and don't know what to do. I am the key man / only one who knows how to do a ton of things in the company, from working analytical prototypes to how to manage our social media accounts. I don't have capacity or mental energy to hand these off in a good way, and i feel like if we just had a list of the top 10 most painful processes, and an organized dashboard to start storing them down, batch by batch, we could get out of the mess. \n\n**Procedures** - see above \n\n**Workflow management** - we are putting work into the workflow system asana and that seems to help. But things get put in a non-standardized way, assignments are often incomplete or misentered. If we could get the book of procedures tight, we could that automate the workflow for most types of deliverables, which would massively reduce confusion, bottlenecking and the overhead of having to retrain people because their is no standard body of knowledge \n \n**Knowledge library / file storage** - our files are totally fucked up. So much good work, spread over so many different files, some of which have brilliant gems, but across a chaois of brainstorming that represented the last year. We scrap our document library we lose a ton of good work and criticial thinking that was done to shape our product to date (prototypes that haven't landed in our core code), procedures that are mixed in with people's personal notebooks, etc. But i lack the bandwith to go organize it all myself. If i could get an nice clean inventory of all the documents, i could start tagging, sorting them and identifying like documents taht could be sorted, organized and archived, but i need the right tool / inventory design and that takes thinking.\n  \n**Talent library** (who are our people, contact info, expectations, legal docs, individual expectations, training, key meetings they need to attend, etc. - also what our our current talent gaps, where are the bottlenecks and what roles do we have unfilled, etc.) \n\nIf i could have a top down scan of my peoople, have quick and dirty weeekly metrics (who has their individual charters / responsibiilities setup, when was the last time their documents were audieted and kept to standard, are they in the right meetings, etc?) that would go such along way to get us from bad to good.\n\n**current focus:** buidling out some k level versions of these tools and populating them by end of week. That said, i can't help but think i'm not the first person to have to go build an organization from scratch. are their any good tools out there that are designed to prompt this work, capture it in an organized way, etc. etc.\n\nsome sort of template or tool that already exists in excel would be great. i know the answers, i just need a good enough tool that will put it all together and i don't want to reinvent the wheel on tired eyes\n\n\n**Any suggestions for easy templates / existing spreadsheets to build out my startup's COO level architecture (process mapping, inventory of my people, pillar by pillar metrics, etc.)**\n\nWe have about 3 core teams, about 2-3 groups of people per team, and about 25 project contributors. This seems too complex to manage via weekly memo, without the right structure underneath it. Or at least, i'm finding i need some more structure.\n\n**Any other ideas? How would you go about solving this wonderful mess?**",

My brother is this way. He's 32 years old and single and has really low self esteem so I feel bad for him in that way and race issues towards black men bother him a lot. But when I'm with him, he stares at non Black women *nonstop* like his entire body and head will turn so he can check out a woman walking by but a Black female walks by and it's almost like he tries to look away. He proudly tells his friends (none of them are Black) that he's \"pickier with Black girls\" and that she'd have to be a perfect 10 for him to notice... but he's not exactly the perfect 10 type of guy, and his standards for other races are so low. He will date very homely, overweight or just bland looking White, Latina and Asian women. Even then, he doesn't attract many women because he doesn't take care of himself much, physically & that adds to his low self esteem. He also stares at couples who are interracial with a Black man a lot. I tried to hook him up with my friend but I felt bad because she was the one who asked and she's black/brown skinned and I knew he'd not like that.  I'm a Black female, it just feels disrespectful in a way, like his mind is so twisted when it comes to race and I don't understand it other than deep insecurity. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe also says the \"I think she's mixed\" thing when he finds a Black girl he finds attractive, which makes me cringe. Our mother is dark skinned, our dad is multiracial and very light but loves dark skinned women like my mom. My brother is darker like my mom but myself and my other siblings are all lighter tones. He seems the most affected by his race in a negative way. We also grew up in a majority white city but this issue seems beyond that. Should I just continue to ignore this? A part of me just wants to pick his brain and ask him *why* he seems to hate Black women so much... I've been reading up more on Black female issues, especially colorism and they're annoying me, so to have a brother who so openly adds to them is driving me insane. But then I feel like I can't change him, he's allowed to have his thoughts... idk. Anybody experience similar? Any suggestions?",

Do these things being expressed by us seem ok to you somehow? Do you feel powerless to change it? Are all these men and women simply wrong about how the world works and what should be done to change it?\n\nI've been working for the past few years to finally do whatever it takes to overcome the abuse, addiction, trauma, depression and feelings of abandonment I've had to suffer these past 56 years.

The educational and academic crises boys and men are facing. Terrorizing men in the workplace, in social situations, hell, at the PARK ffs... I swear, I could go on forever with this list.\n\nAre you all afraid to address these things? Do you just not understand them and so feel you can't do anything about them? Are you all stupid, or just malicious and indifferent? Regardless of how you answer those questions, do you have any concern for what will happen if you DON'T address them? If your answer to THAT question is no, then I'll have to conclude that you are stupid... Because there are many, many more of us thrown away men EVERY DAY. We're giving up. We're killing ourselves (either quickly with guns, ropes and other forms of violence or slowly with drugs, alcohol or other self-destructive behaviors).\n\nThe hell of it is, society is telling us NOT to give up! I hate to be the one to bring this up, but what do you suppose will happen if we DO stop giving up and killing ourselves...? Do you honestly believe we will simply accept our lot in life and remain quietly on the garbage pile you've put us on? Again, that's just willful blindness and ignorance.\n\nAnd whom do you point us to in the social sphere...? Men like Jackson Katz, Michael Kimmel & Michael Messner? Women like Amanda Marcotte, Jessica Valenti and Clementine Ford? Jeezus, the most honest example of a woman even recognizing the humanity of ordinary men is Brene Brown.... She's a protege of Oprah Winfrey!! Sorry, but that's just not gonna cut it.\n\nDo you all in the public sector just not understand the forces you're playing with? Don't you get it?\n\nWhat the hell is going to happen when this all leaks out into the streets and you have open, violent unrest and conflict... Not between classes, or races or politics or religion, but among the genders? How the hell are you going to manage that? Really. I'd love to hear the contingency plan for open, violent conflict between men and women breaks out.\n\nLike I said, tens and hundreds of thousands of us now, and more every day. Just lately we either kill ourselves or just ghost to one degree or another.\n\nYou all do NOTHING about this other than more draconian laws, more anti-male policies for employers, educators and healthcare providers, the outright embarrassment that is social support for victimized men and boys and more and more aggressive, brutal and punitive law enforcement and courtroom policies aimed solely at MEN.\n\nHow long do suppose we're going to put up with this...?",

I'm suggesting that the majority of men and women would be happier in a traditionalist arrangement: the woman takes care of the kids and home and the man is respected and honored for his contributions in turn.   Nor would this prevent women from achieving status in the male sphere.   It would just be more unusual since women would be doing the more important work of raising children.\n\nA return to a traditional conservative lifestyle is impossible absent collapse.   Female liberation has [never](https://archive.org/details/b20442580) been internally reversed.   Unfortunately it is also incompatible with large inequalities due to female hypergamy.    The majority of men are left out in the cold, so have no impetus to work.  Therefore a combination of men's rights and socialism are required if civilization is to continue.   This will naturally lead to men and women embracing traditional gender roles.    The only other alternative is a return to patriarchy, however that is exceedingly unlikely for reasons JD Unwin explains in the above link.   \n\nI was recently watching a documentary about a financial depression in the late 19th century.   A (female) professor noted that \"many women were forced\" into the workplace.   It struck me as an odd turn of phrase, since feminists claim that women weren't \"allowed\" to work back then.   Turns out this is false.   Karen Straughan notes that there are records e.g. of female blacksmiths going back to the middle ages.   Women could work, they just didn't want to.   Why would they?   For 90 percent of the population working sucked.   It still does.  Also, it's hard to work when you're pregnant.   \n\nThe only way feminists can get away with characterizing the traditional female sphere as a prison is by lying about it.   In truth, women could own [property](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/continuity-and-change/article/favoured-or-oppressed-married-women-property-and-coverture-in-england-16601800/617F23DD2D64A036C58E0BF7D56F89BE), wife-beating was severely [punished](https://www.debunker.com/texts/ruleofthumb.html), and women were respected for their role in society.    Alexis de Tocqueville commented on the essential equality of the male and female spheres in Democracy in America (1840) :\n\n“Americans,” he said, did not think that men and women should perform the same tasks, “but they show an equal regard for both their perspective parts; and though their lot is different, they consider both of them as being of equal value.”\n\nWomen have ALWAYS been greatly respected by men for being mothers and nurturers.   What is a more important job than raising a child?   It was only a small number of envious man-haters that decided otherwise.   \n\nThe feminist movement appears to have arisen not do to \"oppression\" but boredom.   Rich women lived lives of luxury most men could only dream of, but they were envious of the social status of their doctor and lawyer male relatives.   They wanted the privileges of both the female and male spheres.  They wanted to \"have it all\".\n\nA number of intellectuals expressed concern, though not as many as you'd expect considering the enormity of what feminists were proposing.   The socialist Earnest Belford Bax claimed that women were already the [privileged sex](https://archive.org/details/fraudoffeminism00baxerich).    The socialist Mother Jones, who spent most of her time organizing male coal miners and fighting child labor, considered it absurd that women could be \"liberated\" by work.   And Nicola Tesla, one of the most brilliant men who ever lived, predicted that \"equality\" between men and women would quickly lead to female superiority and massive social dysfunction: \n\n\"This struggle of the human female toward sex equality will end in a new sex order, with the female as superior. The modern woman, who anticipates in merely superficial phenomena the advancement of her sex, is but a surface symptom of something deeper and more potent fermenting in the bosom of the race.\"\n\nThe Catholic GK Chesterton, who embraced socialist ideas about land reform, suggested that mixing the traditional male and female spheres would be a disaster for society.   \n\nThis [article](http://gkcdaily.blogspot.com/2015/03/chesterton-notorious-anti-feminist.html) provides a decent summary.   \n\n>Woman is wrong, he considers, to try to adapt herself to society by making a man of herself. The contrary should come about—Society should adapt itself to womanhood by becoming gentler. To Feminists, he acknowledges that women undergo a revolting tyranny in factories; but he wanted to destroy the factories, while they, he felt, were content with destroying womanhood.\n\n\"The virtues of the Family and Home, due to free choice and limitation, form the basic cell of the social organism. Banish the spirit of Home, and you suppress the very possibility of a sanely constituted society.\"\n\nChesterton advocated wealth redistribution to the poor so that women wouldn't have to work.   George Orwell, who despite popular belief was a socialist, recommended the same: \n\n\"Far more drastically than anyone has proposed hitherto, taxation will have to be graded so as to encourage child-bearing and to save women with young children from being obliged to work outside the home (CW 16, 223).\"\n\n\"This, of course, is a subject of great interest in India, and roughly what we want discussed is how far women benefit by escaping from home and whether in the long run it is desirable for them to undertake the same work as men” (CW 13, 474).\n\nFeminists set about to destroy the \"patriarchal\" family, but they had nothing to replace it with.   We are not living in hunter-gatherer societies; the idea that the \"whole tribe\" would raise children has amounted instead to children being stuck all day in daycares and classrooms.   Women aren't able to spend as much time with their children as they'd like: they're too busy working.   They have replaced loving husbands with asshole bosses.   In a tragic irony, the \"new American dream\" for women is to become a [housewife](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/09/12/is-opting-out-the-new-american-dream-for-working-women/#3c1b00ad623a).     \n\nThe single mother experiment has been a disaster.    Feminists assumed that men were only needed for their wallets, whereas it turns out that that males are [crucial](http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/family/experts-say-father-s-involvement-pivotal-proper-child-rearing) at every stage of child rearing.   The statistics for children raised by single mothers are nothing short of horrific.  \n\nWhat about men?   Men no longer feel like they have a role to fulfill, so are increasingly dropping out of society.   Suicides are at all time high.   Drug and alcohol addiction is rampant.    \n\nBy privileging girls in school and women in work, young women are now out-earning young men.   This leads to women being unable to find what they consider suitable partners due to hypergamy.  \n\nWomen have become ever more hateful and spiteful toward men.   Part of this is due to feminist lies, part of this is due to being forced to compete with the opposite sex.   The sexes aren't supposed to compete with one another; that's not how we were designed.   We're supposed to be complementary.  Since male leaders don't want to compete with women, they gave them ever more privileges at the expense of men.    So much for patriarchy theory.  \n\nAnd now we find the reason why being a housewife is the new American dream: Research has found that stay-at-home mothers are [happier](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3634473/The-job-makes-happiest-Housewife-Survey-finds-stay-home-mothers-satisfied-profession.html) than those who work (female unhappiness is actually at an all time high).   So the whole feminist experiment was a gigantic waste of time.   More than that, it was a potentially fatal social experiment.    \n\nWomen who don't have children are more likely to get [cancer](http://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health-specialist/childless-women-and-cancer.aspx).   The same applies to women who wait until their thirties to have children (the current trend).    Fewer and fewer women are giving birth.   Since population levels are unsustainable, more and more immigration is required.   This, in turn, leads to increased mistrust in communities.    The ruling class is able to play off workers against one another with ease, preventing solidarity.  \n\nMale creative genius is ignored and suppressed instead of being nurtured.    And for what?   So women can become unhappier?  \n\nIn The Red Pill, Warren Farrell emphasizes flexibility of roles.   But women don't seem to want flexibility for men.   They become resentful of stay at home dads.   They recoil at men expressing emotions.   They refuse to \"date down.\"   They demand all of their traditional privileges.  \n\nThe association between communism and feminism arose mostly from Marx's benefactor Friedrich Engels.   However it is interesting that many of the early socialists rejected his views on the subject and had no problem with traditional gender roles.    They didn't think women should be *forced* to be housewives, but as mentioned, only rich women were privileged enough to conceive of work as liberation.   \n\nFeminists have re-engineered society but it has not helped either men or women.   In the Israeli Kibbutz, which embraces an anarchic form of social organization, people were not given any gender roles but naturally became the most traditionalist society in the world.   This leads me to believe that the vast majority of both men and women prefer behaving like men and women.   We have created a society that ignores the happiness of the 99% and caters to outliers among both sexes -- in particular lesbians.    These outliers should not be oppressed, but they shouldn't dictate how the rest of us behave either.  \n\nIf it is respect and independence women are after, men's rights combined with traditional gender roles would allow them to have both.   They would be respected as mothers, would still be allowed to enter the male sphere if they wished (though only on equal terms -- no feminist bullshit), and wouldn't have to suffer being wage slaves.   They would not be able to simply divorce the man and take the kids and his money, so marriages would remain intact.   Men would likewise be able to act as men again, without being demonized; they would be respected and honored for the work they do to maintain civilization, and would have all the rights that women currently have.   \n\nEgalitarian economics would ensure that the majority of men not be excluded from romance due to hypergamy.   \n\nBonus: Christopher Hitchens: Women shouldn't have to work.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQas34criFo",

    "text": "Minor issue I had in person with a feminist. (Not anti-feminism) First off, apologies if this is not the right kind of subreddit for this post, I am just wanting to have a little vent so feel free to delete or whatever if it doesn't fit.\n\nA little background; I am an Assistant Manager at a pub in a large town in England, and have worked there nearly 4 years now. We are just outside of the centre so rarely get any crazy customers, however last Saturday was an exception.\n\nTo set the scene, I was barely 20 minutes into my shift when I had to call down the landlord to deal with some customers (a couple, male and female) who were complaining. He told them basically exactly what I did, they were not happy about it and ended up getting arrested for assault on him and another member of staff.\n\nWhilst the landlord and other member of staff were at the police station giving their statements, a fairly drunk customer tripped outside and had a gash on his nose. Being the designated first-aider I dealt with that and he was a great sport and his friends were taking the mick out of him.\n\nNo sooner had I dealt with that then I was told of a customer who was harassing some other customers. So I went to see what was going on, got the guy away from the people he was harassing and was chatting to him to ask what happened. The jist of it was that he is a bigoted anti-feminist who was spewing a bunch of insults at a group of customers, specifically at the two women in that group. He was taken away by his more sober and reasonable friend and I went to go talk to the group he harassed to get their side and smooth things over.\n\nThis is where the actual reason for this post lies. The rest was just showing that it has been a hectic night and by this point I haven't been behind the bar to serve people for the past 2 hours as I have been dealing with these incidents.\n\nSo I am letting these women rant about this guy and it was obvious that he was the instigator and the issue. Part of which was him accidentally knocking over one of their £19 bottles of beer they had barely had any of. Once they have finished with their story I feel like the best way to smooth this over is to apologise for his behaviour and offer them a replacement bottle and a round on the house. \n\nSo I say something along the lines of \"... so I would like to get you guys another bottle and a round on us.\" And before I could say anything further the larger of the two women puts her hand outstretched towards me and said:\n\n\"I've got to stop you there, I don't like the way you referred to us as 'guys', we are ladies and would like to be referred to as such. Maybe in future think of using something like 'folks' when referring to people as that is a non-gendered word.\"\n\nI was just so taken aback by this statement, these customers have been present since before the aforementioned arresting incident and must have some idea of how stressful and hectic this shift has been. I am here offering them a lot of free drinks and this woman has the audacity to tell me off for using what I think of as a fairly generic term for a group of people. I do understand that 'guys' is a gendered term, however in the context there was no gender attachment required.\n\nOut of all the things that happened that night (as that was not the last incident either, must have been a full moon or something...), this one snippet has bothered me the most over the past few days. And that statement by her was followed during my stunned silence by her asking if I was okay to authorise giving away so much beer, asking me where the manager was.\n\nNow the structure of staff at the pub is; Landlord/Owner and his wife, then myself and another Assisstant Manager, then the rest of the bar staff. Meaning that whilst the Landlord was away giving a police statement, such decisions to give away beer by way of apology is well within my right.\n\nI am a white male at a fairly average height with a slimish build, and I am 21. So I can kind of see where she is coming from as usually you would expect someone older to be managing a pub, but to voice it as condescendingly as she did, right after telling me off for saying 'guys' is in my eyes, very insulting and extremely hypocritical. I was tempted to just tell her to sod off and walk away, but unfortunately I decided keeping some semblance of professionalism was the easier route.\n\nSorry for the rant, this went on longer than I expected. And sorry if this is not the right content for this subreddit.\n\ntl;dr - feminist tells me off for referring to their mixed gender group as 'guys' whilst I was offering them free stuff, and then proceeds to assume I didn't have the authority to give stuff away anyway.",

    "text": "Hooked on bell hooks, part 3: \"Consciousness-raising: a constant change of heart\" (from \"Feminism is for everybody\", 2000) Enjoy this bite-sized excerpt from bell hooks' book \"Feminism is for Everybody\"\n\n[Author page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks)\n\n[Amazon - book reviews](https://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Everybody-bell-hooks/dp/0745317332#customerReviews)\n\nPlease post below your thoughts and comments on this text!\n\n***\n\n\"**Consciousness-raising: A Constant Change of Heart**\n\nFeminists are made, not born. One does not become an advocate of feminist politics simply by having the privilege of having been born female. Like all political positions one becomes a believer in feminist politics through choice and action. When women first organized in groups to talk together about the issue of sexism and male domination, they were clear that females were as socialized to believe sexist thinking and values as males, the difference being simply that males benefited from sexism more than females and were as a consequence less likely to want to surrender patriarchal privilege. Before women could change patriarchy we had to change ourselves; we had to raise our consciousness.\n\nRevolutionary feminist consciousness-raising emphasized the importance of learning about patriarchy as a system of domination, how it became institutionalized and how it is perpetuated and maintained. Understanding the way male domination and sexism was expressed in everyday life created awareness in women of the ways we were victimized, exploited, and, in worse case scenarios, oppressed. Early on in contemporary feminist movement, consciousness-raising groups often became settings where women simply unleashed pent-up hostility and rage about being victimized, with little or no focus on strategies of intervention and transformation. On a basic level many hurt and exploited women used the consciousness-raising group therapeutically. It was the site where they uncovered and openly revealed the depths of their intimate wounds. This confessional aspect served as a healing ritual. Through consciousness-raising women gained the strength to challenge patriarchal forces at work and at home.\n\nImportantly though, the foundation of this work began with women examining sexist thinking and creating strategies where we would change our attitudes and belief via a conversion to feminist thinking and a commitment to feminist politics. Fundamentally, the consciousness-raising (CR) group was a site for conversion. To build a mass-based feminist movement women needed to organize. The consciousness-raising session, which usually took place in someone’s home (rather than public space that had to be rented or donated), was the meeting place. It was the place where seasoned feminist thinkers and activists could recruit new converts. Importantly, communication and dialogue was a central agenda at the consciousness-raising sessions. In many groups a policy was in place which honored everyone’s voice. Women took turns speaking to make sure everyone would be heard. This attempt to create a non-hierarchal model for discussion positively gave every woman a chance to speak but often did not create a context for engaged dialogue. However, in most instances discussion and debate occurred, usually after everyone had spoken at least once.\n\nArgumentative discussion was common in CR groups as it was the way we sought to clarify our collective understanding of the nature of male domination. Only through discussion and disagreement could we begin to find a realistic standpoint on gender exploitation and oppression.\n\nAs feminist thinking, which emerged first in the context of small groups where individuals often knew each other (they may have worked together and/ or were friends), began to be theorized in printed matter so as to reach a wider audience, groups dismantled. The creation of women’s studies as an academic discipline provided another setting where women could be informed about feminist thinking and feminist theory. Many of the women who spearheaded the introduction of women’s studies classes into colleges and universities had been radical activists in civil rights struggles, gay rights, and early feminist movement. Many of them did not have doctorates, which meant that they entered academic institutions receiving lower pay and working longer hours than their colleagues in other disciplines. By the time younger graduate students joined the effort to legitimize feminist scholarship in the academy we knew that it was important to gain higher degrees. Most of us saw our commitment to women’s studies as political action; we were prepared to sacrifice in order to create an academic base for feminist movement.\n\nBy the late ‘70s women’s studies was on its way to becoming an accepted academic discipline. This triumph overshadowed the fact that many of the women who had paved the way for the institutionalization of women’s studies were fired because they had master’s degrees and not doctorates. While some of us returned to graduate school to get PhDs, some of the best and brightest among us did not because they were utterly disillusioned with the university and burnt out from overwork as well as disappointed and enraged that the radical politics undergirding women’s studies was being replaced by liberal reformism. Before too long the women’s studies classroom had replaced the free-for-all consciousness-raising group.\n\nWhereas women from various backgrounds, those who worked solely as housewives or in service jobs, and big-time professional women, could be found in diverse consciousness-raising groups, the academy was and remains a site of class privilege. Privileged white middle-class women who were a numeric majority though not necessarily the radical leaders of contemporary feminist movement often gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle. Women with revolutionary feminist consciousness, many of them lesbian and from working-class backgrounds, often lost visibility as the movement received mainstream attention. Their displacement became complete once women’s studies became entrenched in colleges and universities which are conservative corporate structures. Once the women’s studies classroom replaced the consciousness-raising group as the primary site for the transmission of feminist thinking and strategies for social change the movement lost its mass-based potential.\n\nSuddenly more and more women began to either call themselves “feminists” or use the rhetoric of gender discrimination to change their economic status. The institutionalization of feminist studies created a body of jobs both in the world of the academy and in the world of publishing. These careerbased changes led to forms of career opportunism wherein women who had never been politically committed to mass-based feminist struggle adopted the stance and jargon of feminism when it enhanced their class mobility. The dismantling of consciousness-raising groups all but erased the notion that one had to learn about feminism and make an informed choice about embracing feminist politics to become a feminist advocate.\n\nWithout the consciousness-raising group as a site where women confronted their own sexism towards other women, the direction of feminist movement could shift to a focus on equality in the workforce and confronting male domination. With heightened focus on the construction of woman as a “victim” of gender equality deserving of reparations (whether through changes in discriminatory laws or affirmative action policies) the idea that women needed to first confront their internalized sexism as part of becoming feminist lost currency. Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING 11ten gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle.

Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make one a “feminist.” Without confronting internalized sexism women who picked up the feminist banner often betrayed the cause in their interactions with other women.\n\nBy the early ‘80s the evocation of a politicized sisterhood, so crucial at the onset of the feminist movement, lost meaning as the terrain of radical feminist politics was overshadowed by a lifestyle based feminism which suggested any woman could be a feminist no matter what her political beliefs. Needless to say such thinking has undermined feminist theory and practice, feminist politics. When feminist movement renews itself, reinforcing again and again the strategies that will enable a mass movement to end sexism and sexist exploitation and oppression for everyone, consciousness-raising will once again attain its original importance. Effectively imitating the model of AA meetings, feminist consciousness-raising groups will take place in communities, offering the message of feminist thinking to everyone irrespective of class, race, or gender. While specific groups based on shared identities might emerge, at the end of every month individuals would be in mixed groups.\n\nFeminist consciousness-raising for males is as essential to revolutionary movement as female groups. Had there been an emphasis on groups for males that taught boys and men about what sexism is and how it can be transformed, it would have been impossible for mass media to portray the movement as anti-male. It would also have preempted the formation of an anti-feminist men’s movement. Often men’s groups were formed in the wake of contemporary feminism that in no way addressed the issues of sexism and male domination. Like the lifestyle-based feminism aimed at women these groups often became therapeutic settings for men to confront their wounds without a critique of patriarchy or a platform of resistance to male domination. Future feminist movement will not make this mistake. Males of all ages need settings where their resistance to sexism is affirmed and valued. Without males as allies in struggle feminist movement will not progress. As it is we have to do so much work to correct the assumption deeply embedded in the cultural psyche that feminism is anti-male. Feminism is anti-sexism. A male who has divested of male privilege, who has embraced feminist politics, is a worthy comrade in struggle, in no way a threat to feminism, whereas a female who remains wedded to sexist thinking and behavior infiltrating feminist movement is a dangerous threat. Significantly, the most powerful intervention made by consciousness-raising groups was the demand that all females confront their internalized sexism, their allegiance to patriarchal thinking and action, and their commitment to feminist conversion. That intervention is still needed. It remains the necessary step for anyone choosing feminist politics. The enemy within must be transformed before we can confront the enemy outside. The threat, the enemy, is sexist thought and behavior. **As long as females take up the banner of feminist politics without addressing and transforming their own sexism, ultimately the movement will be undermined**.\"",

    "text": "\"Feminism: A Very Short Introduction\", by Margaret Walters - The religious roots of feminism Excerpt from \"Feminism: A Very Short Introduction\", by Margaret Walters \n\n[Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Short-Introduction-Margaret-Walters/dp/019280510X)\n\n\n***\n\nSome of the first European women to speak out for themselves, and for their sex, did so within a religious framework, and in religious terms. It is perhaps not always easy, in our secular society, to bring them back to life: to recognize fully their courage, or to understand the implications, or the extent, of their challenge to the status quo.\n\nFor centuries, and all over Europe, there were families who disposed of ‘unnecessary’ or unmarriageable daughters by shutting them away in convents. For some, this must have felt like life imprisonment; but for others, conventual quiet seems to have facilitated genuine fulfilment: it allowed some women to develop a talent for organization, and some were able to read and think, and discover their own distinctive voices. Hildegard of Bingen, who was born at the end of the 11th century and became a nun, and later the abbess, of a small Rhineland convent, has long been known as a remarkable and impressive writer; recently, her great musical talent has been rediscovered and celebrated. But she was sometimes plagued with doubts about her ‘unfeminine’ activities, and wrote to one of the leading churchmen of the time, Bernard of Clairvaux, asking if she – an uneducated woman – should continue with her writing and with composing. He encouraged her, and within a few years she was known and honoured all over Europe. When she was 60 years old, she embarked upon preaching tours all through the German empire, even though at that time only priests were allowed to preach.\n\nLike other medieval women, when seeking to imagine the almost unimaginable, and to communicate her understanding of God’s love, she turned to womanly, and specifically maternal, experience, and wrote of the ‘motherhood’ of God. ‘God showed me his grace again’, she writes, ‘as . . . when a mother offers her weeping child milk.’ Some religious women imagine, with maternal tenderness, the infant Jesus. A Flemish Beguine meditates on what the mother of God must have felt:\n\n>for three or more days [she] held Him close to her so that He nestled between her breasts like a baby . . . sometimes she kissed him as though he were a little child and sometimes she held Him on her lap as if He were a gentle lamb.\n\n‘Just because I am a woman, must I therefore believe that I must not tell you about the goodness of God . . . ?’ asked the Englishwoman Julian of Norwich in the early 15th century. She marveled that ‘he who was her Maker chose to be born of the creature that is made’. Moreover, she argued:\n\n>our Saviour is our true mother in whom we are eternally born and by whom we shall always be enclosed . . . We are redeemed by the motherhood of mercy and grace . . . to the nature of motherhood belong tender love, wisdom and knowledge, and it is good, for although the birth of our body is only low, humble and modest compared with the birth of our soul, yet it is he who does it in the beings by women it was done.\n\nWhereas other women had made the analogy briefly, Julian of Norwich goes on to spell out the comparison very directly. Christ is like\n\n>the kind, loving mother who knows and recognizes the need of her child, and carefully watches over it. The mother can give her child milk to suck, but our dear mother Jesus can feed us with himself, and he does so most generously and most tenderly . . .\n\nMargery Kempe, a contemporary of Julian’s who travelled from her Essex home to visit her, produced an account of her own life – probably dictated to a scribe – that has been described as the first autobiography in English. Her life story reveals, only too clearly, why her self-preoccupation and her melodramatic acting out of her own miseries infuriated so many people who came into contact with her. But her story is also, unexpectedly, a deeply touching one; and more than that, it is impressive simply because she insists on taking herself and her experiences seriously. Margery came up against the painful and terrible aspect of the motherhood that had inspired the celibate Julian. She was miserably ill all through her first pregnancy, and after a prolonged and very painful birth, was left exhausted and depressed: ‘what with the labour she had in childbirthing and the sicknesse going before, she despaired of her life’. At times, she came near to killing herself. She was comforted, she recalls, by a vision of Christ, in the form of a handsome young man sitting at her bedside; he informed her that ‘you may boldly, when you are in bed, take me to you as your wedded husband’. But it was only years later, and after 14 pregnancies, that Margery finally managed to negotiate a deal with her demanding mortal husband: if he stopped insisting on sex, she would pay off his debts, and forgo her strict Friday fast to eat and drink with him. He agreed, though with a hint of sarcasm that echoes nastily across the centuries: ‘May your body be as freely available to God as it has been to me.’\n\nWith remarkable energy and determination, Margery then set out across Europe on a pilgrimage, and though her constant weeping and wailing so infuriated her fellow pilgrims that they abandoned her en route, her courage – and obsessive determination – enabled her to reach Jerusalem, and eventually to get as far as Constantinople.\n\nBy the late 16th century, increasing numbers of women were beginning to argue their case more consistently and more aggressively, though still within a religious framework. The Reformation enabled more women to receive an education. In\n\n1589, in what one historian has called ‘the earliest piece of English feminist polemic’, Jane Anger took up a challenging position by insisting that Eve was superior to Adam: a second, and hence improved, model. Whereas Adam was fashioned from ‘dross and filthy clay’, God made Eve from Adam’s flesh, ‘that she might be purer than he’, which ‘doth evidently show how far we women are more excellent than men . . . From woman sprang man’s salvation. A woman was the first that believed, and a woman likewise the first that repented of sin.’ Anger then descends crossly, and comically, to everyday domestic life. It is women, she reminds us, who make sure that men are fed, clothed, and cleaned: ‘without our care they lie in their beds as dogs in litter, and go like lousy mackerel swimming in the heat of summer’.\n\nBut any woman wanting to defend her sex had to tackle powerfully negative scriptural images of women: Delilah was treacherous, Jezebel murderous, while Eve was directly responsible for the Fall of the human race: ‘the woman tempted him and he did eat’. Saint Paul was regularly invoked against any woman who spoke out, or asked awkward questions about the Church’s attitude to women: ‘Let your women keep silence in the churches, for it is not permitted to them to speak’, he instructed the Corinthians. And again, in the epistle to Timothy, ‘if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home: for it is shame for women to speak in the church’.\n\nGradually, a few women found the confidence to defy these scriptural prohibitions. Some offered dissenting interpretations of Genesis, arguing that Adam was, after all, as much to blame for the Fall as Eve. So, in 1611, Aemilia Lanyer reminded her readers that Christ\n\n>was begotten of a woman, born of a woman, nourished of a woman, obedient to a woman . . . he healed women, pardoned women, comforted women . . . after his resurrection, appeared first to a woman.\n\nAnd Rachel Speght sardonically remarked in 1617:\n\n>If Adam had not approved that deed which Eve had done, and been willing to tread the steps which she had gone, he being her head would have reproved her, have made the commandment a bit to restrain him from breaking his master’s position.\n\nOthers insisted that God had signalled his forgiveness by making Mary, a descendant of Eve, the mother of Christ.\n\nIn the course of the troubled 17th century, particularly among the sects, the many and various small groups that rejected the established Church in favour of purer forms of worship, women found more freedom. Some, at least, felt inspired to preach or to prophesy. Modern historians have pointed out the important role of women among the religious separatists who fled persecution in late Elizabethan England by emigrating to America or to Holland, as well as their activity as preachers. Women were active, too, among the small dissenting groups that managed to survive underground in England, until, during the Civil War and\n\nInterregnum, they emerged dramatically and vocally. Keith Thomas lists some of these independent congregations: Brownists, Independents, Baptists, Millenarians, Familists, Quakers, Seekers, Ranters. Whatever their theological differences, they all believed the necessity for spiritual regeneration in every individual. The experiencing of what Quakers called the ‘Inner Light’ was more important than external observance – and that light knows no sexual distinction. As one contemporary writer claimed, ‘one faithful man, yea, or woman either, may as truly and effectually loose and bind, both in heaven and earth, as all the ministers in the world’.\n\nVarious independent congregations had, for some time, been allowing women to debate publicly and to vote on matters of  Church business; by the 1640s some, particularly among the Quakers, were going further. In 1659, the Quaker Fox argued that ‘Christ is in the male as in the female, who redeems from under the Law . . . Christ in the male and female, who are in the spirit of God, are not under the Law.’\n\n‘Might not the spirit of Christ, that is begotten of God in the female as well as the male . . . speak?’ asked Katherine Evans and Sarah Chevers. Increasingly often, women felt moved, divinely inspired, to speak in meetings and even at service, though they were often greeted with bitter opposition. They were criticized for being ‘puffed up with pride’ and ‘vainglorious arrogance’, and even worse, for ‘usurping authority over men’. In 1646, for example, John Vicars complained bitterly about ‘bold impudent housewives . . . without all womanly modesty who take upon them . . . to prate . . . most directly contrary to the apostle’s inhibition’.\n\nJohn Bunyan was totally opposed to this active participation by women, arguing that Satan, inevitably, tempts the weaker Eve, rather than Adam: ‘the man was made the head in worship, and the keeper of the garden of God’. He referred to women as ‘that simple and weak sex’. Citing the first epistle to the Corinthians, he argued that women are ‘not the image and glory of God as the men are. They are placed beneath.’ He disapproved of separate women’s meetings, which did nothing but encourage ‘unruliness’. ‘I do not believe they [women] should minister to God in prayer before the whole church,’ he insisted, adding sarcastically, ‘for then I should be a Ranter or a Quaker.’ In any public gathering, ‘her part is to hold her tongue, to learn in silence’\n\nEven in the 1670s, that courageous Quaker Margaret Fell still felt the need to defend women’s independence of conscience, and their right to play an active part in worship. In a tract called Women’s Speaking Justified, she argued emphatically: ‘Those that speak against . . . the spirit of the Lord speaking in a woman, simply by reason of her sex . . . speak against Christ and his Church, and are of the Seed of the Serpent.’\n\nThe prophet Joel was sometimes cited as an answer to Saint Paul’s prohibition spirit upon all flesh:\n\n> . . . and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood and fire, and pillars of smoke.\n\nJoel’s ecstatic vision seemed, to many, particularly relevant during the great upheavals caused by the Civil War and the Interregnum; there was a widespread feeling that apocalypse was, indeed, imminent. The sect who styled themselves Fifth Monarchists, for example, believed that the world’s four great secular empires – Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome – having passed away, the fifth – Christ’s Kingdom and the rule of the saints – was close at hand. In this feverish and volatile climate, prophets, many with revolutionary ideas, flourished.\n\nIn this area, a woman’s supposed passivity, her receptivity to outside influence, could, ironically, be claimed as an advantage: she might prove more receptive, more open, to becoming a channel for the voice of God. The Belgian prophet Antonia Bourigue, who was widely read in England, produced a disconcerting and double-edged justification: ‘they ought to let God speak by a woman, if it be His Pleasure, since he spoke in former times to a Prophet by a Beast’.\n\nBut the line between prophetic inspiration and lunacy, between possession by God and by the devil, was a narrow one. In 17th-century England, women were still being tried for witchcraft. Moreover, female prophets could easily be dismissed as merely crazy. Lady Eleanor Davis, for example, had been claiming divine inspiration for years; early one morning in 1625, she heard ‘a Voice from Heaven, speaking as through a trumpet these words, There is nineteen years and a half to the Judgement Day’. She went on to publish tracts that were interpreted as predicting, amongst other things, the death of Charles I. Her husband burned her books; and she was often the butt of jokes. An anagram of her name – Dame Eleanor Davis: Never so mad a ladie – was gleefully circulated. But her visionary fervour put her at real risk; even her rank could not protect her from charges of treachery. In 1633, after being charged before the High Commission that ‘she took upon her (which much unbeseemed her sex) not only to interpret the Scriptures . . . but also to be a prophetess’, she was fined and imprisoned in Bedlam. But she came into her own during the Interregnum, when many of her prophecies seemed to have been realized. She went on to publish at least 37 tracts between 1641 and her death 11 years later.\n\nAnother prophetess, Anna Trapnel, experienced some kind of revelation at a Baptist church in London. By 1652, she had joined the Fifth Monarchists, and in 1654, she accompanied a male preacher to Whitehall, where she fell into a trance that lasted for 12 days. Crowds gathered to hear her prophecies – and her harsh criticisms of Oliver Cromwell and his government – which were recorded in Strange and Wonderful News from Whitehall and The Cry of a Stone. She insisted – in verse – that God’s message was addressed to women as well as men:\n\n>John though wilt not offended beThat handmaids here should sing, That they should meddle to declare The matters of the King . . . .\n\nThe authorities labelled her as mad, but still brought her to trial. ‘The report was that I would discover myself to be a witch when I came before the justices, by having never a word to answer for myself’, she said. But her sheer volubility defeated the court, and she continued, undeterred, with her prophecies. Cromwell’s government undoubtedly took this kind of prediction seriously; several times, he and his council were interrupted by, and seriously listened to, prophets, several of whom were women.\n\nThe appeal to divine inspiration was probably of limited value as a means of female emancipation; the feminism of the future would depend less on the assertion of women’s spiritual equality and more on natural rights, and a denial that there is any intellectual difference between the sexes.\n\nBut there were political implications to this outburst of religious fervour. In the 16th century, the Anabaptists had recognized women as equal to men, and allowed them to pray and speak in meetings. Women from the congregations who styled themselves Levellers seem to have been particularly active on a larger stage, and showed considerable political shrewdness. The sect encouraged women’s activity, believing in the equality of all ‘made in the image of God’. In the 1640s and early 1650s, when many of their husbands were in prison, Leveller women repeatedly turned up en masse at\n\nWestminster – staging what sounds very like contemporary ‘demonstrations’ – to demand freedom for their husbands, but also to complain bitterly about their own, consequent hardships. They were usually treated harshly, and rebuked for meddling in things beyond their understanding. The crowds of women who petitioned for peace in 1642 and 1643 were dismissed contemptuously as ‘Whores, Bawds, Oyster women, Kitchen maids’. Three hundred women, who presented another petition to the House of Lords, were rejected out of hand by the Duke of Lennox. ‘Away with these women,’ he exclaimed, adding, with a jeer, ‘we were best have a Parliament of women.’ In May 1649 yet another petition for the release of the Leveller prisoners was turned away sarcastically: ‘It was not for women to Petition, they might stay at home and wash the dishes.’ To which the women, unabashed, retorted, ‘we have scarcely any dishes left us to wash’.\n\nLater in that year, they tried again. As many as ten thousand women signed yet another petition, asking:\n\n>We cannot but wonder and grieve that we should appear so despicable in your eyes as to be thought unworthy to petition to represent our grievances to this honourable House. Have we not an equal interest with the men of this nation in those liberties and securities contained in the Petition of Right, and other good laws of the land? Are any of our lives, limbs, liberties or goods to be taken from us, no more than from men, but by due process of law . . .\n\nA thousand women carried it to the House with sea-green ribbons pinned to their breasts. Once again, they were dismissed scornfully.\n\nBut among the Quakers, particularly, women found the chance to develop their skills as administrators. Regular women’s meetings were set up alongside the men’s meetings in the 1650s; and though, from the beginning, women seem to have concentrated on traditionally feminine areas, such as welfare and moral problems, they had the chance to develop their own, very effective organization, which in fact handled considerable sums of money. However, historians have suggested that there was a gradual reduction in the scope of their concerns; by the 1680s, they were confining themselves to ‘womanly’ matters. In these later years, they concentrated on ‘such things as are proper to us, as the poor more especially and the destitute amongst us’. These included helping young men to find apprenticeships or work, and instructing younger women ‘to all wholesome things’, which included looking after their husbands, children, and homes, and always behaving in a manner that was ‘discreet, chaste, and sober’.\n\n***\n\nImage from the chapter: http://i.imgur.com/16cTngI.png\n\n*\"The scene is viewed with a hint of satire – though is it directed at the earnest speaker or at the inattentive audience?
