    "text": "Manager Wins Big in Office Raffle Hey Reddit, just had to share this interesting story from our office Christmas party. So, our company was on a tight budget for the event, and they decided to fund the event with a lottery ticket sale – 50% funding the party and the other 50% going into a raffle draw with one winner taking it all. \n\nNow, we've got a diverse team with varying income levels. I would say about 70% of us make a little above minimum wage (18+ dollars an hour), while the remaining 30% are licensed healthcare professionals pulling in 50+ bucks an hour.\n\nHere's where it gets a bit tricky – our manager, who makes the most money out of all of us (maybe 60-70+ and hour), dropped a solid $100 on tickets  (20 dollars for 5 tickets), most likely a gesture to help fund the party. Fast forward to the end of the party, and guess who won the raffle prize of 500+ dollars? Yep, our manager.\n\nCue mixed reactions among the employees. Some thought it was a bit unfair given the income disparities within the team. We were hoping for a grand gesture like treating the whole staff to pizza or maybe paying it forward to another colleague in need. Instead, the manager decided to keep the money for themselves.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this situation? Is it just luck of the draw, or should there be a more equitable way to handle such scenarios within a team?",

    "text": "Why you should not refer a friend to work at the same company as you. I have a friend whom I helped get hired by the company I work for. I helped her with her resume, and I gave her resume to one of the bosses with great references. She previously worked unloading trucks at a grocery store for 5 years, so her new position as a receptionist, to me, seemed like a great opportunity for her to start a career in a much better environment.  The only fact that I found to be strange, was that she was not applying to different jobs, but she was mostly obsessed with the open positions available at the company I work for. As I know her for 15 years and I consider her my very good friend, I helped her without expecting anything in return.\n\nNow, fast forward 6 months since she was hired, and I am having the following issues:\n\n\\- She uses me as her therapist during work time. She has problems with her ex and comes to my desk to talk about her problems for quite a while. The company has a laid-back culture, and no one would get into trouble because of it but I am tired of hearing about someone else’s problems on demand. There is a difference between listening to her once a week and every day at any time of the day.\n\n\\- She keeps complaining about her job already, even though she is a less physically demanding job at a higher pay rate than in her previous position. Now, she wants to know how much money people in my department are compensated, and she told me she wanted to apply to work there too.\n\n\\-  I feel better at work when she is not there. When she is there, I feel like I need to be in friendship mode with her all the time. If I do not show up to work for some reason, she calls me to see if everything is OK. It feels like she knows too close about different aspects of my life. Work and my personal life got mixed up and I am not knowing how to handle it.\n\nIt seems like her life has always been drama and now everything related to her at work is drama too. I am so tired of her. I already found a new job and I knew I would not stay in this company for too long, so this situation is transitory. I am writing this just to warn anyone out there who wants to help a friend in need, DO NOT refer a friend to the same company you work for. Your friendship will probably change, not to mention all the risks you face if your friend turns out to be a subpar employee.\n\n  POST EDIT:\n\nThank you for all that replied to my post.\n\nFor those who said that I am the problem because I have low boundaries, that is true. I am a people pleaser, and my first impulse is to help and understand the other side. I need to learn how to work on that.\n\nWhat bothers me the most about her is that she has had issues with a lot of people at work. She is always saying something about someone or talking about what this or that person did to her.  This is a situation that I do not understand because, before she started in this company, what she mentioned about employees had never bothered me. She talks about the lady who works from home and has more privileges than the others, she got her heart pumping fast and was all infuriated when a coworker made a joke she did not like, she went to HR and told them that they made a mistake AND it was their fault. There is more to the history, but I will stop here. The bottom line is, I liked working for this company way more when she was not there because I was not involved in any drama.\n\nI do not regret referring her to the hiring manager, but I feel that it is time for me to follow my path and wish her the best.",

    "text": "If I get asked why I am leaving my current company, is \"mismanagement\" an acceptable reason? I am looking for a new job, because I have been assuming the mistakes of poor communication and time management from my superiors, despite my best efforts to work with their management styles and performing my own due diligence, I still get myself into trouble. It's gotten me on the PIP, and the only way I can pass is if I can please a recent PM who was just promoted this year and new to the role, alongside another PM with poor time management skills. At this point, I have exhausted all my efforts. \n\nI have been with my company for 8 months, and I don't think that looks good on my resume. Sure it's more than a typical onboarding period, but I hate it when people accuse me of being a job hopper. I have a few gaps in my resume with a total of about 3 years of experience in my field. One of the gaps is because I couldn't find a job when I got out of college in 2020, I could just say COVID and long-haul for that one; the other was because I was diagnosed with cancer, and it took 8 months to complete treatment. I have heard mixed advice on whether or not I should disclose my history. I still see doctors regularly to make sure the cancer has not returned as well as other conditions it caused. \n\nBack to the question: \n\nIf a potential employer at an interview asks me why I am leaving my current company, can I tell them it's because of poor management? Does this answer make me look bad? \n\nI have done everything in my power to communicate, look through my work thoroughly to check for mistakes, and yet my PMs get upset with me because I ran out of work before 5 or there's a serious problem in a design, and I don't feel like I am experienced enough to have the authority to address it alone, otherwise doing it myself will just cause more problems/work for the PMs. \n\nI admire teamwork and coordination, which I have felt has been lacking at my current company.",

    "text": "Job offer rescinded for interviewing with another position at the same company I'm a new grad in the process of job hunting and recently had an offer rescinded, and I want some outside opinions on it because I'm getting mixed opinions on whether what I or the manager did was justifiable or not.\n\nTo start, I originally received a LinkedIn DM from manager A for a position on their team. I had gotten through both interviews and was in the reference check stage when I received a DM from another manager (manager B) at the same company, also reaching out for an interview. The positions were the exact same, except they were on different teams and involved with different products. \n\nI was already fairly confident that I would get the offer from A, but I thought there was no harm in doing the interview anyway, so I accepted. During the interview, I briefly mention to manager B that I had talked with manager A about their team, and B doesn't ask me any further questions about my involvement with A. When B asked if I'm considering any offers at the moment, I say no because I hadn't yet received an offer from A. That's all I really divulged about my status with position A. This was partially because I didn't think it would be important to mention as the teams seemed segregated, and also I was taking the advice that people usually give which is to be vague in interviews about competing interviews/positions. \n\nThe same day after that interview, I receive an informal offer from manager A. After a few days of us working out the details, manager A asks to call me. On the call, they tell me that they will be rescinding the offer because they discovered that I had interviewed with manager B, and that I didn't properly communicate to B about how far in the process I was with them. They also mentioned it was a company policy that a candidate could not be involved with multiple positions. I apologized, saying that I honestly had no idea it would be a problem and that I was not asked about it so I assumed it was fine, to which they responded that it was \"common sense\". They explained to me that they have access to all applications and they can see, for example, if someone says in interview that they are only interested in one position but also applies to multiple positions at the same company. I was quite shocked and upset after the call, as it seemed to me that I was being accused of being dishonest at worst and stupid at best.\n\nAt this point I'm not really looking for advice for getting the offer back as A was quite firm, but as I am new to all of this I'm wondering how normal this is and what/whether I should have done something differently. I'm also wondering if this should be considered a red flag, as some people have mentioned to me that companies should have a centralized HR system to avoid miscommunications like this in the first place.

    "text": "Am I stupid to still be pissed about the job I was fired from in July? To make an extremely long story short, I was fired in July for recording a video of me doing something at work that wasn't work related. I played one of our display pianos. I got fired for that. I'm still pissed off about it. Full story below. TLDR at the end.\n\nFor context, I'd been working at this job for 4, almost 5 years. I was great at it. I loved my job. I centered a lot of my life around this job because it was in my career path (music education). My new manager, after my old manager left, was a good friend of mine. We got along great. We played games when it wasn't busy, like Minecraft and her Nintendo Switch, we joked and when we had everything completed we chilled.\n\nThat is, until she started to become a corporate suck up and began metaphorically sucking our district manager's dick and randomly became super strict out of nowhere, like not using our phones during work. Even though she frequently still played games and stuff. Then, one day, she fired me. There's a lot of lead up in between, but that's how it ended. \n\nI'm not pissed because I got fired. I wasn't planning on staying at that job forever and I have a MUCH better paying job now, with a lot more freedom, and I don't have to work with customers. \n\nI'm pissed because the shit she fired me for (\"doing non work related things in the clock\") IS THE SAME SHIT SHE WAS DOING. She's a huge fucking hypocrite for talking to me like she literally didn't bring her Nintendo Switch to work to play the Legend of Zelda. All I did was record a 15 second video of me playing one of our display pianos. Which I used to do on my \"break\" all the time (spoiler alert, I frequently ran the store by myself, so yeah, I didn't get a break). She was friends with me on Snapchat and never had a problem with it, until I guess during one of her BJ sessions with our DM he must have brought it up somehow???? Idk it was totally out of the blue.\n\nApologies for the long rant, I've been bottling up my anger and frustration for months now. Why did I get fired, and not her???? She also fired my coworker who provided a PDF of the employee handbook to me after I was fired, because my family wanted to take it to court. (It never happened.)\n\nTo top it all off, the white employee (yes I'm bringing up race, both me and that coworker who was fired are black) who stayed 2 hours after we closed to fuck around on guitars WHILE ON THE CLOCK was given a temp position instead so he could \"have time to find another job.\" But we were fired randomly. No write ups. The only two black employees in the district. \n\nWhere I live, you don't need a write up or anything to get fired, but it still sucks.\n\nTLDR: I'm pissed because I got fired for the same exact shit my manager was doing.",

    "text": "It’s clear I’m the backup candidate. Withdraw or ignore? **Thank you for all the helpful responses!!**\n\nI've found myself in a situation where a prospective employer has repeatedly given me mixed signals. They're aware of my strong interest in the position, yet they seem to treat me as a backup candidate.\n\nFor instance, after my final round interview a month ago, they initially mentioned that they would provide an update within a week, as there was only one other candidate in consideration. However, when I followed up three weeks later, I was told that they're now interviewing more qualified candidates and they 'hope' to reach a decision by the end of November.\n\nI initiated the interview process in late September and had my last interview during the first week of October. \n\nIt's a challenging situation, and I'm leaning towards accepting an offer with relocation assistance I’ve received during the last week of October. It just isn’t as prestigious but it’s something. As of now, I'm two student loan payments behind.\n\n——-\n\nOn another note, it's worth mentioning that this role has the potential to be a significant launchpad for my career. Interestingly, the hiring manager for this position achieved it after completing her MBA. While I don't have an MBA, we both attended the same state school and shared a similar major. Perhaps, she initially interviewed me as a courtesy.\n\nI understand that the parent company is presently in the midst of significant shifts within its management team. I'm striving to maintain a positive outlook and believe that these changes could be indicative of a more favorable transformation, particularly given the company's prior association with nepotism.\n\nMy instincts lead me to believe they might be contemplating interviews for these 'nephew' candidates. Although this can all be wishful thinking as I lack concrete proof and it’s just a basis based off their history.",

    "text": "I think I'm spiraling into job-hunting depression I have applied to over 300 positions. In the coming days I will be applying to more. Out of everything, I only had 1 initial interview, 2 hiring managers who ghosted me, and 1 who changed their mind the last minute and canceled the initial interview with me the day before, 100+ rejections, and the rest don't even have updates so it's all basically up in the air. I'm mentally and emotionally exhausted and I try to keep going but it gets so frustrating. \n\nBack story : I moved to the US just recently from Asia, have been unemployed since last year while I waited for my work authorization. I spent almost 11 years at my last job so the hiring practices the last time I was looking for a job was different. I had a decent job back home at a very big company doing B2B sales, and had no problem getting sought out by recruiters because of my experience. \n\nNow I'm wondering if I would ever get hired here in America. I know what I am capable of but some days I end up second guessing myself. I feel like the longer I am unemployed, the more I'm losing my sharpness. Some days I barely recognize myself. I also feel so bad that my husband has to work to support me because I haven't found a job yet, and I have drained all my savings. He is a very good guy and doesn't really mind, but we're limited to doing a lot of things because we're single income and budget is tight. Sometimes I feel so useless. I'm really trying my best to take it one day at a time, but I feel like I'm slowly falling into depression and it's hard to shake off.\n\nI don't know if it's me. If I'm doing something wrong. If it's my race, my gender. My degree that's not from an American institution? Is it because I don't have an MBA? Or that I stuck too long at my old job? I don't know where I'm heading, it's just really exhausting. \n\nFor those of you who are in the same boat as I am, how do you hang on? What do you do when applying for jobs? \n\nFor those who are in the same situation but already found a job after hundreds of applications, how did you do it? Any tips to share? \n\nI don't mean to make it this long but I just had to get this off my chest.",

    "text": "A nude video of me was shown around school when I was thirteen and it still haunts me at 25. I do not know what to do. (Mention of suicide in a movie: I should mention that I talk about a movie where a character commits suicide. )\n\nI am currently in therapy and I have been open about being bullied, but I still feel so much shame, and it is, at the moment, not possible for me to bring this up.\n\nI had a pretty nice time in elementary school, but then \\*boom\\* on the first day of 5th grade and it all went downhill.\n\nI  heard so many unkind words I can not even count them. I suspect that I developed an eating disorder because of this because it was my only way of coping with anything.   I never talked to anyone about this and just let the literal years pass me by never being able to say anything back to bullies or talk to anyone about it.\n\nI still have so many social issues I can't even begin to describe them, but mainly social anxiety and a general sense of avoiding everything I can and a constant feeling of anxiety basically all the time with a good mix of worrying about literally anything I could worry about.\n\nThis was not \\*just\\* a nude video, it was a pretty embarrassing one where I put on a bunch of crazy makeup and moved around fully nude lol. I guess that is what being a teenager does to you sometimes.\n\nThe most annoying part is that it was my fault that the video was shown around. It was not leaked or anything. I had such severe social anxiety that I could not say no. Logically, I knew not saying no would be worse but my brain and body would not let me say no I was so scared. So two girls asked if they could see my iPod on a weeklong school trip. The absolute first thing they did was check my photos. I could tell because of the way they looked at each other.  Fast forward to a girl from my class coming to the room I was staying in and, now I know, pretending to be \"sick\" and if she could play with my iPod. Again, at this point I could have deleted the video, please, please do not ask why I did not because I just can not explain the anxiety I had. The rest is history. Probably most of the two classes comprising around 18 people must have seen the video.\n\nThis would haunt me for years in school. So now it was not just being bullied for being chubby, or wearing ugly boots (that I actually loved lol), now there is this.\n\nA few months later, the same girl received so much comfort from a teacher and the class because a friend showed around pics of her in underwear, I set next to her and could not believe this. Of course, no one ever deserves anything like that, but it was a crazy almost surreal situation for me because I was still getting bullied for it.\n\nAround the same time, I saw a film that is pretty much how things were for me, in a strange way it helped me because I did not receive any kind of comfort for the seriousness of the situation. The character has this happen to him, but the film is leaked I believe. He finally changes schools and seems to be happier, but on the first day realizes a boy smirking at him, clearly having seen the video. In the end, the character kills himself.\n\nI recently rewatched the film and had a complete breakdown, and that is actually why I finally went to a therapist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI honestly just pray that this video is not on anyone's phone. I don't think we had internet access there and a lot of people did not have smartphones, but iPods like mine were popular. So the only possibility is that someone filmed it or something like that, or also had an Apple device.\n\nI just pray that is not the case. And if it is I can kind of comfort myself with the thought that it would be illegal because I was literally a child.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy biggest issue: This keeps haunting me. I keep scanning every public area (I live in a relatively large city but you do run into people) for people from school. I always had to be on guard for someone to say \"nice video\" with a little disgusting smirk. It has gone so far that I completely panic when I see a picture of a bully, or even an actor who looks like him (he also literally played the bully part in the movie).\n\nI have this dreaded feeling that this will always haunt me. I tried moving, but I was not better off mentally, on the contrary probably. And besides all, I actually like my city and my best friend, and I love my family and do not want to live away from them.\n\nBut whenever I get this feeling it's horrible. I cry and feel so hopeless. I did see 2 guys from school around a couple of weeks ago and even if I'm pretty sure they do not know all that I panicked. I'm severally fucked up socially because of this and any kind of rejection (I do not mean romantically) makes me spiral for days. Made a mistake? end of the world, let's feel horrible for a week straight. Small talk? Too much lets constantly fantasize about being at home. And I have an annoying fear of what other people might think of me: They think I am dumb, annoying, etc. Overanalyzing someone's facial expressions, etc.\n\nSorry for the rant. My biggest issue is that this will in fact always haunt me. I have read a study where it basically says a lot of bullies stay being assholes. I am sure some people have forgotten, but for others, this is the first thing they think about when they would see me. I know I could not physically endure even seeing someone work in the same place as me because I would always be on edge, even if they just make a little \"joke\".  I do not think my friend, who was around at the time, barely understood the gravity of this. She did not, for example, understand why I did not want to come to her birthday when she invited someone who used to call me \\*insert chubby-related nickname\\*. To be fair, I really do believe she did not understand it, and she had serious stuff going on herself.\n\nThis feeling of always being prepared is so draining. I am currently in Grad school and will soon be doing an exchange semester in the U.S. while I am scared of my mental illness worsening when being alone, I am also excited \"to get out\" for a few months.\n\nI can not find any resources on this specific topic. It's like the movie is the only one, and it is not healing in any kind of way. I hate always being stressed out. Everything stresses me out I do not know I managed to get a degree, yet I find myself comparing myself to other students in my program who are 23 while I am \"already\" 25. There is so much going on I feel so overwhelmed.\n\nI wish I could turn back time and never make that video then I would still have issues, but I could deal with having been bullied for being chubby. But, at the moment, I can not deal with the other stuff. Anywhere, I could run into someone saying something or knowing this. I want to live. And I hate that feeling of dread because when it comes it is like the most hopeless pit of despair. I still find myself emotionally eating from time to time, and when it is really bad I have the big urge to do something \"damaging\" like drinking a bunch of alcohol which I luckily never did and hope I won't do. The only thing I do is spend money in not the healthiest ways, but it has gotten so much better, and I do not go into debt anymore for a quick rush of endorphins, but I still need to work on my budgeting skills. I avoid so many necessary things, like going to the dentist or gynecologist because I am generally in a state of embarrassment after all these years, still.\n\nSorry, this is such a rant. I would be very grateful for any resource on this or any words about the whole \"on guard\" thing or \"this will be part of my life forever\".\n\nEDIT: There are probably a bunch of mistakes sorry English is not my first language\n\nEDIT 2: I have been a bit scared to look at the responses which is why I have been putting it off for a while... I'm currently experiencing a lot of shame that has resurfaced and I just can't find the strength to respond at the moment. But I am reading all of your lovely responses and I am so so grateful for all these kind words. Thank you so so much. I am currently crying because I have never heard kind words about this.",

    "text": "PSA: Don’t let the narrative fool you: men are absolutely gold-diggers, too. My husband’s a certified financial planner for our small town community. He has hundreds of clients, and prefers to work with hard-working, down-to-Earth, millionaire-next-door types: union workers, frugal pink-and-blue-collar workers, mid-level managers, etc. The kind of person who’s lived in the three bedroom, one bath house they raised their kids in for forty years, who buys a ten year old Taurus when they need a “new” car, and spends well under their income to “save for a rainy day.”\n\nYesterday he came home just devastated. One of his clients, a lady in her mid-fifties, was moving to another planner. Generally not a problem, but she was moving to her new boyfriend’s finance guy (who had no industry licenses that require him to be a fiduciary, like my husband). In the past six months, she had cashed out more than 10% of her accounts. The last time they spoke, my husband warned her that with the markets down (they were at the time), her investments couldn’t handle continuing on the same trajectory. Also, there were going to be taxes and penalties activated if she keeps keeping on.\n\nShe’s not yet retired; she’s a nurse, and currently working reduced hours because her boyfriend doesn’t like her “being away from him for so long.” \n\nShe *was* a millionaire. All on her own. She had never married, though she had been in a long-term relationship for quite some time that ended in the last five years. She doesn’t have any kids of her own, though her ex had two she was close with. My husband remembers her coming down to the office every month with a check for her accounts, so proud of herself for scrimping and saving and making it work. He bought her a bottle of champagne when she created over the “millionaire” threshold, and he and his mentor took her out for dinner. She had dreams of snow-birding in Florida.\n\nHe’s pissed. Not at her, really. Maybe a little, because she dropped a decade-plus long, trustworthy relationship with him because of a guy she’s been seeing for less than a year. But even he admits that’s mostly ego talking, and he’ll get over it once the sting fades. No, he’s mostly angry at her boyfriend and at the situation. \n\nHe’s frustrated because there isn’t the language to talk about what’s happening here. *He* knows what’s happening, but how does he convey it to her, when we don’t talk about men as gold-diggers? (Especially to that Boomer generation?) Maybe if her boyfriend was significantly younger, or maybe if she was significantly older, or if she came from generational Wealth with a capital W, or maybe if it were her kids’ taking advantage, or maybe if she was more infirm or mentally fragile there would be *some* kind of social blueprint for him to talk about this *and for her to hear him.* He did try! He cares deeply for his clients. But then he gets an email that she’s moving her accounts to someone else.\n\nBut, he says it happens about as frequently as it does to the men, when you control for the wealth and marital status. The reason why you don’t hear about more women getting scammed is because women, as a population, are poorer than men. We’ll get moochers, layabouts, and deadbeats who are happy to live off of us for free, but we don’t call those guys “gold-diggers” because we generally don’t have any gold to dig. And when we do, we’re often already married to someone. He has very few single women as clients (and most that he does have built wealth in a marriage and then divorced, or are “recently” widowed). But, when he thought back on his twenty or so odd years in the business at all the “gold-diggers” that have preyed on his clients, there’s a roughly equal proportion.\n\nHe said her leaving is a mixed blessing. Because he can’t be around to help advise her to protect herself, but he also won’t have to watch this guy bleed her dry ten years before she retires.\n\nAnyway, PSA not to buy your new boyfriend a Harley so he can live his dreams of riding coast to coast on the back of his hog. And also, talk to your girlfriends about gold-diggers. IMO, we should be calling all the out-of-work, can’t-lift-a-dish, spent-the-water-bill-money-on-weed-while-you-pull-a-double dudes “gold-diggers” just to normalize the term among women. Maybe if we can gender-neutral the phrase, then when *our* generation starts to hit the place where we can retire comfortably we will have the language to warn against the men who think they struck it rich.\n\nAnd three pieces of housekeeping:\n\nOne: I am not a finance person, and I also changed some info to protect myself, my husband, and the lady involved. So any inconsistencies in the money talk are either on purpose, or on accident cuz I don’t frickin’ know and I’m running off memory.\n\nTwo: yes, I know that this is a story coming from privilege and about privileged people. Boomers got a real sweetheart of a deal and a nurse retiring a millionaire is awesome and enviable. But, I do feel the story is important because part of our generation’s women’s narrative is of taking control of our own power and sovereignty. Language matters. Tropes matter. Shared understanding of what is and isn’t possible matters.\n\nThird: no point in sending me a Reddit Cares, lurkers, I turned that off ages ago. Scream into the void. ✌️",

Of course this was super painful, and all I had in terms of “pain management” was a high dose of Advil and Xanax to relax my anxiety. After the procedure was finished and I was lying on the exam table with my feet still in the stirrups, my (new) doctor informed me that what she had pulled out of me was the Mirena, and not in fact the Liletta that I thought I had for all these years. At the time, I had requested a 3 year IUD and the liletta was what my doctor carried. All of my health records say that I received it as well. Ultimately it got approved for longer usage, so I decided to keep it in. \n\nI pretty immediately started crying, and have been feeling really freaked out since. I know that ultimately it didn’t impact my health, but I can’t stop thinking about how I didn’t know what was in my body for nearly a decade. Regardless of whether it was a simple mix up or not, I can’t shake the feeling of not being in control of my own reproductive health. I keep crying a bunch, and it doesn’t help that I’m still cramping/spotting from my iud procedure, reminding me of that really vulnerable moment. \n\nHas this happened to anyone else here? I’m sort of at a loss for who to talk to.",

    "text": "Women’s Healthcare and Lack of Anesthesia So I had a three step procedure done today - removal of several large cervical polyps, removal of my IUD (it’s strings were somehow tangled up with one of the polyps that needed to be biopsied), and then insertion of a new IUD. All without any anesthetic or pain killer of any kind.\n\nNow, I have had IUDs removed and new ones inserted before, and while not pleasant, I have been able to deal with it. But this, what I went through today, was a whole other level of pain.\n\nI had multiple polyps. One of of which was very large and had to be removed in pieces. And that one was tangled with the IUD because when they removed the first half of the large polyp, the IUD came out too (which they told me ahead of time was going to have to removed). The cramping and pain I felt was unreal. Like at that point, I was writhing on the table and trying to breath through the pain. And then they went back in for the rest of the large polyp.\n\nAnd then because I have known clotting issues, I began to bleed pretty significantly and they had to insert several things into me to get the bleeding under control. And then, they had to to insert the new IUD.\n\nThe pain was so bad and the cramping was so painful, that I was close to tears and I have never had any medical procedure make me cry before. And when they finished and told me to sit up, I got lightheaded and had to lay down for awhile.\n\nAnd what was really overwhelmingly upsetting to me after the fact was the complete lack of pain management. Like my husband has had skin moles cut off for biopsy and he gets a nice little numbing spray before hand. But here, they were removing multiple polyps from my cervix and there was nothing for the pain.\n\nAnd even if they didn’t anticipate that this would be painful, why the hell didn’t they stop and offer pain relief once it was clear that I was in significant pain? When you are at the dentist getting a cavity filled, they always tell you to let them know if you are in pain and they will give you more Novocain.\n\nBut here, for something far more invasive than having a cavity filled, there was no concern for my well-being or attempt to make me more comfortable. And I did verbally tell the doctor that I was having severe cramping and in significant pain and she just blew me off and kept going with the procedure. (In fact, she said that she was “pretty sure” that she didn’t perforate my uterus so I was fine. Like those are all the options - either your uterus is perforated or you’re completely fine, no in-between.)\n\nThe whole thing made me feel so powerless while it was going on and afterwards I feel this mix of sadness and absolute rage. What the fuck is the wrong with the state of women’s healthcare that I can’t have access to basic pain relief? It’s so fucking inhumane and dehumanizing.",

    "text": "Donating eggs - my perspective. TLDR: I anonymously donated eggs in 2021. Yesterday I met my donor daughter for the first time. She will be 1yo this month. She is beautiful. She looks like me and my youngest child. Her parents are wonderful. I am incredibly happy for them. My donor recipient had a hard time and went through a lot to get her daughter. My youngest child has been begging me for a sister so he sort of got his wish haha.  \n\n\nLong version:   \nI live in Australia so you can't sell your blood, plasma, sperm or eggs. If you donate, you do it altruistically. I've always donated blood and plasma - I hit 75 donations before my doctor told me to give it a rest for a year. In 2021, I watched a doco on Netflix called One More Shot about infertility. I've always wanted to be a mum. I met my husband at uni. After three and a half years, we got married the day after I turned 23yo (husband was 24yo). I had my first son a year anda bit later when I was 24yo and had my second son when I was 27yo. I'm 32yo now. I fell pregnant easily - especially with my second. I fell pregnant the week my Implanon (contraceptive) was taken out. My GP didn't believe it until he checked the dates - he was the one who took the Implanon out. My point is that I am very fertile, I am done having kids and I have plenty of eggs that I don't plan on using so why not donate?  \n\n\nDonating in Australia had a lot of prerequisites: you had to be of a certain age, be relatively healthy, had finished your own family or sign a waiver saying you wouldn't blame the clinic if your fertility was affected by your egg donation(s), etc. You also had to go through a few other hoops like sessions a few months apart with a psychologist. If you were married like me, you need permission from your partner and they too would have to do some psych sessions. Then came the blood work. The forms. Vaginal scans. Medication. Lots of needles. Lots and lots of appointments. As an egg donor, you basically went through the IVF process and stop short of the implantation part. That was all fine with me. Inconvenient but I'm a SAHP so I had a lot of free time. The clinic paid for everything for my donation - apparently some clinics in Australia want you to donate (for free) but also expect you to pay for it too (medications, hospital stay, doctor fees, psych fees, etc.) so I'm guessing that's when you know who your donor will be and the recipient parents would cover that. I'm an anonymous donor so I didn't know who would get my eggs. I could put stipulations and pick recipients who were of a certain age, race, religion, nationality, etc. but I didn't. When I woke up from the egg retrieval surgery, I was handed a gift bag with a note basically saying thank you and that even if my donation did not result in a baby, that at least I gave them a little more hope anyway. I've kept that note and filed it away.  \n\n\nA year later I heard there wasn't many donors, even less than the exisiting dwindling pool of donors, due to covid. So I made another egg donation in 2022 at the same clinic. My ovaries were overstimulated again but this time was much worse than last time. I was sick for longer and had gained a lot of weight and decided not to continue - legally you could donate up to five families. During this second donation, the clinic let slip that my first donation recipient was pregnant. I was glad for them but didn't seek out anymore information at the time.  \n\n\nOne day I got an email telling me our donor database was being moved over to a government one and I had to fill out new forms. During this process I found out I had a match, that one of my egg recipients were successful and had a baby girl in 2022 (clinic can release the gender and year of birth of donor children to egg donors). I was so glad for them and didn't want to pry so didn't send that email to the clinic. So I filled out the new forms. I had the choice to not put down any identifying or contact information until the child was 16yo but I put down all my details incase they needed it for whatever reason. Maybe they didn't need my details today but might need it in the future before the kid turns 16yo. When the kid turns 16yo, they could find me whether I liked it or not. I was also fine with never hearing from them ever as well.\n\nWithin a week of filling out those new forms, I got an email from my donor recipient. The first embryo implanted worked and she had given birth to a beautiful baby girl. The mum sent me a photo of her and her daughter that day (10mo), plus another photo of her daughter as a newborn. I literally screamed that my kids ran to me. I was so excited and happy for her! I quickly showed my sons and my husband the photos. My youngest who is 4yo has been bugging my husband and I for a sister. My 4yo celebrated and screamed \"yay, I have a sister!\"\n\nThe next few weeks were a mixed bag of feelings. My kids who were extremely happy and excited came home one day saying they don't want to talk about their donor sister and wanted to keep it all a secret. It turned out no one believed them at school and had called them liars. I talked to the teachers and we sorted everything - my kids are fine now. My husband and I had years to talk and process different outcomes of my donations but I forgot that my kids are so young that they would need much more time to sort it all out for themselves. My mum and siblings were excited and a little heart broken but mostly happy. It took almost a year to donated eggs from when I first made an inquiry to the egg retrieval and last blood test. My dad passed away a couple of months before the egg retrieval surgery. He was proud of me, excited, and fascinated by the egg donation. I'm sure my mum would've wanted to talk to him about it.\n\nThe day came when I would meet my donor recipient, her partner and her daughter. I was very, very nervous. Mostly thinking that they wouldn't like me. I was worried that my skin would be darker than they expected it to be or that my personality wasn't what they'd imagined. I didn't want to be a disappointment. When we got to their driveway, we saw their amazing vegetable garden - much like ours. I was so, so nervous but I had my two kids, who are also very keen gardeners, running around the garden finding veggies they could identify. We never even got to knock on the door because my husband and I were chasing after our boys. I looked up and there they were -  they just appeared out of thin air haha. My donor recipient was holding her daughter who looked very much like my youngest. Her daughter had just woken from a nap and was a little groggy but was excited to see my boys playing in her garden. My boys wanted to give her a hug immediately but my eldest changed his mind said that they both should wait and not scare the baby so they crouched on over and said hello. I noticed that she has my eyes, my eyebrows and the same hair as my boys. She definitely has her father's nose and a few of his features too. Time will tell how much more she will take after me or her father (also biological father) through our shared DNA. I'm sure she'll take after her mother's mannerisms and such too. I'm happy that my donor recipient could carry her child through pregnancy, labour and delivery - I know how much she wanted that. I know my pregnancies made me a little closer to my boys and is genuinely a unique experience.\n\nWe eventually went inside. I found out my donor recipient's husband/donor child's biological father is also a long distance runner like myself. My recipient loves gardening like I do. It turns out they are very much my sort of people and I was just so happy for them. I was also relieved that they liked us too. My donor child is so very loved. Her parents had gone through so much. Again, I had my children so easily and young that I never thought about miscarriages, IVF or anything to do with infertility at all. It just never came up in conversations. It was only after I donated that a lot of my friends and family told me about their stories of loss and infertility. My donor recipient had a few miscarriages with some after IVF. I can't imagine the heart break she and her husband endured throughout the years.\n\nI feel a bit goofy typing this but there was this weird amazing feeling when I held my donor child. It was sort of a \"hey there you, did you know that your mum went to the moon and back to get you? You magical little thing. I'm so happy you're here\" She is the sweetest baby girl. She didn't cry at all throughout our visit. Loved being held by my husband but more so me - I kept bouncing her to make her laugh so that's probably why. Her parents said that she doesn't usually like being held by men at all and that she usually takes a little to warm up to people in general but she came right along with my husband and I. She followed my boys everywhere with her tiny legs - she only learnt how to walk a couple of weeks ago. We talked for a couple hours until my children got overtired and probably overwhelmed. We took some photos to show our both our families (hers overseas and mine out of state). They kept mentioning how grateful they are but I don't really know what to say to that. I'm just really, really happy for them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust a couple of notes I want to add in:\n\n1. There hasn't been enough time for my second donation (2022) to result in a child but I've been told the (19 successfully frozen) eggs have been allocated to a family so I hope they get their little one(s) too even if I don't get to meet them ever.\n2. My husband probably would've donated sperm but because we didn't want to have anymore children, he had a vasectomy in 2019. I watched that documentary in 2021 so it was just too late for him to donate sperm in the typical and inexpensive way.",

    "text": "My experience with the medical abortion pills I just want to put something here because I've barely been able to talk about this experience with anyone apart from my partner and I'm just so happy to be back feeling like my normal self. \n\nSo about 3 weeks ago I (25f) noticed I was late, as someone with pretty regular periods I started to worry but my partner (27m) of 6 years knows I tend to stress out about things a bit too much, told me to hold off for a bit to see if it comes because we've had this once before where I stress out a lot but then eventually come on my period anyway.\n\nSo after being 2 weeks late I couldn't stand it anymore and bought a clear blue pregnancy test, to my surprise (or should I say horror) it said \"pregnant\" \nInstantly I freaked out and called my partner who was in the office at the time while I was WFH. He immediately took the role of the calm sturdy, clear headed man that I know and love. Told me not to worry, we can sort this out and it's going to be okay. We both know as people who can barely look after ourselves that having kids isn't an option, he told me to call our GP and see what they say, then call him back and let him know. My GP referred me to Marie Stopes an abortion service in England, I called them set everything up and they set a phone consultation date up for the next Thursday (it was Friday at this point.)\n\nLeading up to the consultation I felt awful, I was naesous constantly, I would vomit daily 5/6 times, had no appetite and just felt so bloated and disgusting. My boobs (which are already too big for my 5\"2 frame) grew even bigger and I was spiraling into a further  depression (I already take setraline so this was really stressing me out.)\n\nAfter the consultation I had another one the next week and then the pills came the day after the second phone call. \n\nI took the first pill just after dinner and then 24 hours later I did the other 4 pills vaginally. As an anxious person I made the mistake of reading everyone else's experiences and was just so worried the whole time. \n\nAfter 30 minutes of laying in bed the cramping started, not too bad at first but eventually it grew to unbearable pain, I was naesous, had diarrhea (sorry gross I know but it's important to be honest) and was sweating. I went to the bathroom as my partner followed me in, I kept crying saying \"I can't do this\" etc my partner was holding my hand being amazingly supportive. I had to vomit into a bowl cause I couldn't make it off the toilet for long enough to vomit into the toilet. My partner made me some lemon water to drink and refilled my hot water bottle about 3/4 times cause I needed it to be scalding hot to hold on my stomach. I had some coedine but couldn't keep it down so I had no pain meds. \n\nFinally after about 2 hours of intense horror, I felt a release and it all came out in a bunch of different clots mixed with regular bleeding. Literally the second that happened, I went from crying and screaming/groaning on the toilet to \"oh.. it's stopped I feel fine now\" just a complete 180. \n\nI cleaned up, went to my bed, had a coedine and actually managed to fall asleep. When I woke up this morning I felt elated. Waking up to no nausea, nothing felt amazing. I changed my pad and just went about my day. Thankfully both me and my partner WFH Thursday and Friday (typically) so we are both home for the rest of the week. \n\nI cannot recommend medical abortion at home enough for anyone in the same predicament, 2 hours of extreme discomfort but followed by the most amazing feeling of your life. And the luxury to be able to do it in your own home is unmatched. \n\nI just feel like I have a new lease on life, I was functioning at 20% for the last 3 weeks and now I feel amazing. I'm at 110% (minus the bleeding but as someone with periods regularly it's completely fine.)\n\nI had to write something here because I've been unable to confide in my family due to my sister currently struggling with fertility issues for the past 2 years, I am lucky to have the most amazing partner to support me through this but it has been weighing on me not being able to talk to anyone else about this. \n\nThat's it anyway, that's my experience! Interested to hear other people's experiences ..? Thanks for reading if you made it this far!",

    "text": "Putting in effort for patients who aren't fully invested in their own well-being or don't respect my time I thought I could do it, you guys, but it's kind of wearing me down. Recently got a string of frustrating patient encounters. I'm an outpatient psychiatrist (2 years out of residency) and I do a mix of medication management and therapy. \n\nI feel ashamed about it because I feel I shouldn't let these things bother me, but it's been tough. I'm pretty worried I might be getting burned out because of these things and that makes me feel resentful because I have a full panel of other patients. \n\nI try to set boundaries but each time I'm putting in effort and thought into it because I want to be professional and healing and this is extra draining. It'd be easier in the moment if I can just say what I think without all the empathy and the compassion but I also know it's not helpful and obviously unprofessional. \n\nI think maybe I feel resentful for all the effort I put into patients who aren't fully invested in their own well-being or don't respect my time. \n\nExamples:\n\n1. A young woman who decided she wanted to go \"natural\" and stop her mood stabilizer, but then later emails me and asks about getting a prescription for Adderall because she took one of her boyfriend's and felt better. And when I tell her we need to meet and discuss, she says, \"why? We just met. What else do you need to know?\"\n\n2. A young tech guy who literally told me \"I haven't had vacation in like 6 months and it's really hard for me to ask for it because I'm so junior on the team. Can I get a medical leave? I've called out of work and I feel less anxious when I do that.\" We ended up negotiating starting a medication and he'll consider therapy while he gets on leave but this also makes me feel frustrated because on the one hand I feel I should meet patients where they are and I do believe this will net help him, but on the other hand I feel my goodwill is being taken advantage of.\n\n3. An elderly guy who keeps making sexist comments and downplays his drug use. He is a recent transfer from a colleague moving away and he's only on Vyvanse (low dose). I feel maybe it's worth the not ideal stimulant use to work on the therapeutic rapport and explore his substance use without alienating him now, but I also feel he's not that invested in getting better and I don't feel good about this.\n\n4. A young man (very wealthy) who recently got into a fight with a server because they had a bad attitude. This led to verbal confrontations and ultimately a physical fight. The one that made first physical contact, according to patient, is the server; police were called. This patient expresses a lot of frustration over being disrespected, and uses his usual coping mechanisms of buying things, but tells me he went and bought a luxury car but still feels way too angry. He's decided the only way to feel better is to hire the best lawyer and \"ruin them financially\". He says he doesn't care about the money but he bets this server and this restaurant would because apparently it's a small business. I'm trying to talk him down / see this as an opportunity to work on emotional regulation in ways that will benefit him, but like, it's so gross and sad. I'm trying to remember I'm this guy's psychiatrist and not like a judge, and life is unfair, but it's hard for me to keep the empathy. \n\nI think about taking some personal time off but there's so many patients and needs... and I also feel I shouldn't be struggling with this because I should be better somehow.\n\nOh, and in addition I feel like 150% Mom guilt so in addition to all of this I feel I'm abandoning my own family for this job.",

    "text": "With chatGPT in medical news recently, I decided to test it on a case once presented to r/medicine: So I recently saw the article [A boy saw 17 doctors over 3 yeas for chronic pain. ChatGPT found the diagnosis.](https://www.today.com/health/mom-chatgpt-diagnosis-pain-rcna101843) which matched my own experiences - I've had chatGPT identify a rare diagnosis in a patient which I assume was due to its strength of dataset. \n\nI remember however a user called [u/drag99](https://www.reddit.com/u/drag99) who posted some fun cases which I enjoyed working through as an MS4, so thought I would throw [one of them](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/jwimjn/interesting_case_presentation_30_something_year/) to chatgpt word for word and see how it did. You can read my full conversation [here](https://chat.openai.com/share/683a24a2-50a5-466c-916d-ac88e8f56034)  but I apologise as I did some quick mental exercises with it first for a different reddit post I was making - just scroll past them if you're only here for the medical stuff.\n\nFor those who can't or don't want to view the above link, I will paste the relevant bits below: (scroll to the end to skip the AI conversation)\n\n\n**Me**: I am a doctor and id like to test you on a recent medical scenario:\n\nI walk into the room as they are wheeling in a minimally responsive 30 something yo Hispanic male who is pale and breathing 45x a minute. His LLS score is positive. The report I got from the nurse that found him was that he was dropped off by some \"friends\" who didn't know his name or any of his medical problems. They said something about there being a lot of blood and then took off.\n\nThe patient is confused, agitated, intermittently responsive, but unable to answer any questions. His shirt is already off, there is a small amount of dried blood on his abdomen, and some more on his jeans.\n\nOutside of obtaining vitals, what is the first couple assessments you should be making in this patient?\n\n**ChatGPT:** Certainly. Based on the scenario, the patient presents with signs of potential trauma and instability. Here's a prioritized approach:\n\n1. **Airway**: With a respiratory rate of 45x a minute, there's a concern for respiratory distress. First, ensure the airway is patent. Assess for any obstructions or injuries that might compromise the airway.\n\n2. **Breathing**: Given his rapid breathing, listen to his lung sounds bilaterally to assess for any signs of pneumothorax, hemothorax, or other pulmonary issues. Check for symmetrical chest rise and fall. Supplemental oxygen might be indicated based on his oxygen saturation and clinical appearance.\n\n3. **Circulation**: Examine for any signs of active bleeding. The dried blood on his abdomen and jeans could indicate potential injuries. Palpate for distended or tender abdomen suggesting internal bleeding. Check pulses, capillary refill, and blood pressure. Start IV access, preferably two large-bore IVs, and consider drawing blood for lab work (including type and crossmatch). \n\n4. **Disability (Neurological Assessment)**: Evaluate his level of consciousness using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Pupillary response and any focal neurological deficits should be assessed. \n\n5. **Exposure**: Fully expose the patient (while maintaining warmth) to check for any other injuries or signs of trauma. The blood on his jeans might indicate a lower extremity injury.\n\n6. **FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma)**: Given the potential for abdominal trauma indicated by the dried blood, perform a FAST exam to quickly assess for free fluid in the abdomen, which could indicate internal bleeding.\n\nGiven that the patient's LLS score is positive, there's a concern for potential life-threatening injuries. The LLS (Life-threatening Lesions) score is a prehospital tool used to predict the need for a life-saving intervention in trauma patients. \n\nThe patient's condition warrants immediate and thorough evaluation, likely in a trauma bay setting, with appropriate imaging and potential surgical consultation based on the findings.\n\n**Me**: There are a couple answers for this, but the best answer is the ABC's of resuscitation, or airway, breathing, circulation, and importantly, exposing the patient. All we know is that the patient was dropped off, he is pale, looks like shit and likely on the verge of death, and there was reportedly \"a lot of blood\", so we should be considering trauma. His airway was patent as he intermittently screamed, he was severely tachypneic but breath sounds are normal and symmetrical, and he has faint pulses in all extremities w/ an absence of cap refill. We then cut his jeans and underwear off and quickly looked for any wounds including looking at his back and perineum. There was no evidence of any trauma to his body. Of note, his upper abdomen did appear to be distended.\n\nHis initial VS were HR 111, BP 70/33, RR 45, O2 sat 99% on RA, T 35.6C.\n\nWhat are you thinking as the likely diagnosis? What are the initial tests you want to order? And how are you going to immediately treat this patient?\n\n**ChatGPT**: The patient presents with signs of shock (hypotension, tachycardia, altered mental status, cool extremities with poor capillary refill, and tachypnea). Given the absence of external trauma and the distended abdomen, internal bleeding is a major concern.\n\nThe likely diagnosis to consider based on the presentation is **hemorrhagic shock** secondary to an internal bleed, possibly an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture or another source of intra-abdominal hemorrhage.\n\n**Initial Tests**:\n1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To assess for anemia and provide a baseline hemoglobin.\n2. **Type and Crossmatch**: For potential blood transfusion.\n3. **Chemistry Panel**: To evaluate renal function, electrolytes, and lactate (a marker for tissue hypoperfusion).\n4. **Coagulation Profile**: PT, PTT, INR to check for any coagulopathy.\n5. **Bedside Ultrasound (FAST exam)**: To evaluate for free fluid in the abdomen.\n6. **CT Scan of the Abdomen/Pelvis**: If the patient's condition allows, to identify the source of the bleeding.\n7. **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG)**: To assess the patient's acid-base status and adequacy of ventilation.\n\n**Immediate Treatment**:\n1. **Fluid Resuscitation**: Start with crystalloids (e.g., normal saline or lactated Ringer's) while preparing for potential blood transfusion.\n2. **Blood Transfusion**: Given the suspected hemorrhagic shock, initiate a massive transfusion protocol with packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelets as indicated.\n3. **Vasopressors**: If fluids alone don't stabilize the blood pressure, consider starting vasopressors like norepinephrine.\n4. **Warm the Patient**: He's hypothermic, so use warming blankets and administer warmed fluids.\n5. **Surgery Consultation**: If an intra-abdominal source of bleeding is identified or highly suspected, a surgical or interventional radiology consultation is crucial for potential definitive management.\n\nThe priority is to stabilize the patient's hemodynamics, identify the source of the bleed, and address it promptly.\n\n**Me:**: So I knew the diagnosis, immediately, but still wanted to cast a broad net in case I was wrong. I ordered a CBC, BMP, Liver profile, VBG, Type and cross for 8 units, lactic acid, coags, CXR, blood cultures. I also had our charge nurse run down to obtain 4 units of emergency release blood. The nurses caring for the patient immediately placed 2 18g IVs in bilateral arms. The blood that returned from the IV was like nothing I had ever seen before. It had the appearance and consistency of watered down red cool-aid.\n\nI had a nurse call the charge to tell her we are changing the emergency release order to a massive transfusion protocol. I also asked that we not bother with the blood cultures, as this individual was going to need every single RBC possible. I had my medical student do a quick FAST exam to make sure we were not missing a spontaneous splenic rupture. His FAST exam was negative for obvious intra-abdominal free fluid. There was a large amount of fluid in the patients stomach. What is the most likely diagnosis at this point?\n\n**chatGPT**: Given the clinical presentation and the unusual appearance of the blood drawn from the IV (resembling \"watered-down red Kool-Aid\"), the most likely diagnosis to consider is **esophageal variceal bleeding**.\n\nThe following clues support this diagnosis:\n1. The patient's distended abdomen, which could be due to portal hypertension and ascites.\n2. The absence of visible trauma or other sources of massive bleeding.\n3. The \"watered-down\" appearance of the blood, which is characteristic of upper GI bleeding, especially from esophageal varices. Blood from upper GI sources can mix with stomach contents, diluting its consistency.\n4. The large amount of fluid in the stomach on the FAST exam, which could be blood.\n\nEsophageal varices develop in the setting of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. When they rupture, they can cause massive, life-threatening upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Immediate management and stabilization are crucial.\n\n**Me:** Great answer. So ignoring the severity of this case how do we typically medically manage undifferentiated acute upper GI bleeds in the ER?\n\n**chatGPT**: Managing acute upper GI bleeds in the emergency department involves a combination of resuscitation, stabilization, and specific interventions to control bleeding. Here's a general approach:\n\n1. **Resuscitation**:\n   - **Airway**: Protect the airway, especially if the patient is vomiting large amounts of blood. Intubation might be necessary in severe cases.\n   - **IV Access**: Secure at least two large-bore IVs for fluid and blood product administration.\n   - **Fluid Resuscitation**: Begin with crystalloid solutions and consider blood transfusion based on the patient's hemodynamic status and hemoglobin level.\n   - **Blood Products**: Initiate a massive transfusion protocol in severe cases. Otherwise, transfuse based on hemoglobin levels and clinical stability.\n\n2. **Specific Medical Interventions**:\n   - **Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)**: Administer a bolus dose (e.g., pantoprazole or omeprazole) followed by a continuous infusion. PPIs reduce gastric acid secretion, stabilizing clot formation on any ulcerated areas.\n   - **Octreotide**: For suspected variceal bleeding, an octreotide infusion can be initiated. Octreotide reduces portal venous pressures, which can help control variceal bleeding.\n   - **Antibiotics**: For patients with suspected variceal bleeding and liver cirrhosis, prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the risk of bacterial infections, which are common in these patients.\n   - **Erythromycin**: A one-time dose can be given before endoscopy to clear stomach contents and improve visualization during the procedure.\n\n3. **Diagnostic**:\n   - **Nasogastric (NG) Tube**: Inserting an NG tube and performing a lavage can help differentiate between upper and lower GI bleeding. Bright red blood or \"coffee grounds\" appearance suggests an upper GI source.\n   - **Lab Work**: Complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), coagulation profile, liver function tests, and type and crossmatch.\n   - **Endoscopy**: An emergent or urgent upper GI endoscopy is the gold standard for both diagnosing and treating the source of an upper GI bleed.\n\n4. **Consultations**:\n   - **Gastroenterology**: For endoscopic evaluation and potential intervention.\n   - **Surgery**: If endoscopic management fails or if the patient has other indications for surgical intervention.\n   - **Interventional Radiology**: For potential embolization of bleeding vessels if endoscopic measures fail.\n\n5. **Risk Stratification**: Tools like the Glasgow-Blatchford score or the Rockall score can be used to assess the severity of the bleed and guide management decisions.\n\nPatients with acute upper GI bleeds require close monitoring, frequent reassessments, and often admission to a critical care setting, especially if the bleeding is severe or the patient has multiple comorbidities.\n\n----- *anyway I'll leave it there, this is already too much of a wall of text. But considering the wildly misinformed/inaccurate takes I have seen on chatGPT in this sub, I hope this provides some alternative information to at least think about.*",

    "text": "Cocky new ICU nurse orientee I just started orienting a newer nurse in a mixed ICU and he is terrible. He has about 3 years of nursing home experience and 6 months of step down/DOU experience in my hospital. We started off on the wrong foot immediately when he was asking about the possibility of going on rapid responses and taking complicated devices like impella and ballon pumps- to which I shut him down and explained how new he is and it was only his first day we would be going over basic patient care and he wouldn’t see patients like that for a long time. He makes little  mistakes throughout the day and does not take constructive criticism well. He will most likely make big mistakes soon. Today was my third day with him and even after days of talking to him about providing safe care versus being over confident he is so cocky and obnoxious. I had to have a sit down with myself, the orientee and the critical care manager to talk about his attitude and “know-it-all” behavior. He complained that I treat him like a student- he IS my student!!!! My manager was so pissed at him and said this is his last chance and added another week onto his orientation time. STILL moments after that meeting he’s an arrogant inexperienced nurse continuing to be argumentative with anything I say.  He is a recipe for disaster. He asks no questions through the day and attempts to give meds he knows nothing about. Any policy or protocol I explain- he has a rebuttals for. Any education topic I discuss-he seemingly already knows everything about it-talks over me and gives me examples of his experiences (which are based on the TWO times he has been floated to ICU VS My six years experience and MSN in education)I have tried to be nice and quite frankly I’m one of the nicer preceptors on my unit. I almost want to throw him to the wolves and let the older crankier nurses chew him up and spit him out  but that’s not really fair. Today I had to be more stern when he tried to talk over me or dismiss any info. He had the balls to go behind my back request another preceptor after having a meeting about our goals, what he expects from this orientation and if he could offer any feedback. Manager said no way- I was chosen for a reason and no other preceptors are willing…I’m stuck with him again on Sunday. Any advice?",

Ideally a nurse should have no more than 4 patients who are stable but VERY FREQUENTLY nurses will have 6 to 8 patients and in that mix there are very ill individuals. We URGE you to read r/nursing frequently to get a true flavor of the atrocious dangers you are ALL in if you are a patient in the hospital. The medical establishment is gaslighting you with the nice websites, music in the lobby, smiling calm staff but behind the curtain we are all scrambling to make sure we don’t make errors but with all the stress, long shifts ….people are most likely dying from nursing and doctor errors. Most are avoidable if we weren’t stretched so thin. The industry will say there aren’t enough nurses and that is partly true but we’ve been in many many situations where there can be safer staffing numbers. Coworkers calling the hospital offering to work and they are declined. \nUnfortunately, the medical system is all too focused on financials to pay BIG CEO and upper management salaries and they answer to their shareholders interests and NOT you the patients. It is a dangerous time to be a patient. \nAgain, I beg you all….in mass….educate yourselves buy reading the nurse’s comment on how scared they are. Anything marked “vent” is most likely a good read on a stressful and dangerous shift for a nurse.\n\nEdited to add: PLEASE….if you want to be heard go to r/askreddit and add your comments there.

    "text": "My hospital is potentially unionizing and I don’t know where to begin… I’m currently working at a hospital in an employment-at-will and right-to-work state. In general, union membership is not commonplace here. The hospital I work at is part of a bigger corporation. Last year, one of the campuses voted to join NNU, a California-based nursing union.\n\nEmployees at my hospital have very recently received letters warning us about signing anything that may indicate our interest in joining a union. The letter warns that our rights may be infringed upon and the promises from the union are not necessarily true. I’m not dumb, I realize that big companies don’t like unions, and the letter makes that clear.\n\nBut here’s the thing; the management team at my job seems to be against it too. My charge nurses don’t seem to like the idea of it either. The general population of nurses here have mixed opinions. Leadership keeps telling us to “do our research” but I don’t even know where to begin. I feel like everything I’m reading or hearing is biased.\n\nSo, looking at facts, what are the pros and cons of voting for or joining the union? If you do have an opinion about nurses unionizing and want to share it, what is your reasoning for your thoughts? Does anyone have firsthand experience with being in a union/working at a unionized hospital, and if so, what did you like/not like about it? I just want to make an informed choice, so I’m all ears!\n\n***** UPDATE 4/5/23: Thank you all for your replies! I’ve read every one of them and have learned a lot from this post. So far I haven’t seen any union reps at the hospital, but we are still receiving letters from management. I don’t know if or when there will be a vote, but I feel confident that I can make an informed decision now. Thank you all!",

    "text": "Failed transition to the ICU and out of a job. Feedback please. Hi y’all,\n\nI would like to get feedback from other RN’s about my attempt to transition from med-surg/telemetry to the ICU, and if anyone else has struggled with it. \n\nTLDR; I failed. The learning curve was steep. My preceptors would get frustrated because I would often forget things and need things explained multiple times. I was slow at completing tasks and felt pressure to move faster, but also told not to move too fast that I was unsafe.\n\nIn my probationary period as a new RN hire, I was terminated after making a grave error—after replacing a right IJ dressing on a patient, I forgot to re-secure his trach.\n\nHere’s what my preceptor emailed my supervisor:\n“J***** is still very slow at performing tasks…but I let him perform the central line dressing change unassisted. I stayed within close proximity to monitor our patient out of concern. After I saw J***** leave our patient's room, I went in to check on the central line dressing. Upon walking into the room I saw that my patient's trach tie was unsecured, and my airway was not secured. The trach itself was about 75% out of the stoma. Thankfully, the trach itself had not fully left the trachea and I was able to resecure it. J***** then entered the room and saw what had happened.            \n     \nI took J***** aside and educated him again on airway safety and the immediate and life-threatening danger of an unsecured airway. At this point I made it clear to J***** that I was no longer comfortable with him in the room without me.\n\nFor these reasons, I can not recommend that J***** to continue to provide care in our ICU. The pattern of errors and unwillingness to stop and ask for help when out of his depth concerns me greatly. I fear that our patients would be in jeopardy if he were to provide care independently. I do not see additional time in the burn unit benefiting J*****, due to his inability or unwillingness to follow our agreed upon plans. The basic fundamental knowledge of nursing safety is missing, despite attempts at education.”\n\nI have been a med-surg nurse for 5 years, working in trauma for 2 years then renal/telemetry for 3 years. I feel like I have been a safe nurse up to this point in a lower-acuity setting. I clearly bit off more than I could chew moving to a new facility and a new role in the ICU.\n\nI have my MSN; I did well in my program but always had to put more time and effort to learn things compared to my peers, probably due to my undiagnosed Bipolar II and ADHD at the time. The chronic irritability from Bipolar II and inattention from ADHD (i.e., forgetfulness, difficulty task-switching) have contributed to losing two jobs now. I’m on medication now per my psychiatrist, and we’re trialing different stimulants for the persistent inattention symptoms.\n\nI feel like shit. I want to be a safe nurse. I want to be a good nurse. I have poured so much time and effort to become an RN, I feel like it’s a core part of me. But I endangered my patient. And now my family’s livelihood is in question because dad can’t hold a job.\n\nEDIT:\nI’m very grateful for everyone’s feedback, emotional support and constructive criticism. \n\nMultiple people have pointed this out: I failed at ABC’s, at maintaining an airway. It’s so basic, and I fucked up. I rushed this skill, and I should have asked for help. I have done trach care multiple times with another nurse assisting and without issue, this was the first time I made a major mistake like that. But one can’t afford to make a mistake like that even once, I understand that. I can’t tell you how shitty I feel knowing I could’ve killed a person. Any confidence I had as a nurse is shattered. The only reason I’m looking for work is because I’m the sole source of income for our family.\n\nI agree with a lot of you that I should stick to med-surg/low acuity units, or avoid inpatient work altogether until I have the right cocktail of meds to manage my symptoms. My Bipolar II hypomania and irritability symptoms are well-controlled on Lamictal and Depakote, it’s the ADHD inattention symptoms (issues with memory, task-shifting, completing tasks in a timely manner) that persist. I’m trialing different stimulants.\n\nI need to find work quickly though, we have no income flowing in and we will eat through our savings quickly. If anyone knows where to find RN jobs fast, I’d love to hear it.\n\nI was in orientation for 4 weeks before I was let go. I would meet with my supervisors at the end of the week for a performance review and set goals for the next week. My performance was mixed.\n\nWhy did I apply for this Burn ICU job? Because it popped up. And it was at a university hospital I’ve dreamed of working in (they also have pensions and a union). In retrospect, I put myself in a weak position—I should not have tried to take on a new role in a new facility. I should’ve applied for a job I know how to do well (med-surg) to ensure I lasted the 6 month probation period. At that point, the nurse union agreements would protect me from immediate dismissal.\n\nI need to accept that I’m a slow learner. Some people can go straight to the ICU after nursing school and handle it fine, but that’s not me. If I decide to try critical care again, I will take baby steps to get there. Study for the CCRN and get certified. Take classes through the university hospital on ventilators, CRRT, and other critical care stuff I’m unfamiliar with.\n\nFor those asking about the job previous to the ICU one, it was a med-surg/telemetry job on nights. It was great. But I was having chronic irritability that was killing my marriage and family life. My wife suggested moving to days to see if a normalized sleep schedule would help my mood, but that’s when write-ups started racking up. The irritability bled into my work life, and I got several write-ups for unprofessional behavior. I took a medical leave of absence, found a psychiatrist and was admitted into an outpatient behavioral health program. I got diagnosed with Bipolar II and ADHD and was trialing meds per my psychiatrist. When I returned to work, I made one more mistake that was the nail in the coffin—I gave IV push Dilaudid but forgot to scan it for 3 hours. Of course it looked like I was diverting narcotics. I tried to be transparent about my mistake and emailed my supervisor and narc quality department, but they fired me in the end.",

    "text": "I still don't have that \"thick skin\" nurses are supposed to have This will probably be long because I always feel better after ranting lol. But after 11 years of ICU nursing I still can't stand up for myself when it comes to angry families or patients. If someone gets angry or is rude to me and being a bitch I just freeze and can't think, my heart starts racing. And then I think about it forever and can't let it go. I know I take things too personal but I don't know how to let it roll off me like everyone else seems too.\n\nIt's a different story when it comes to a doctor being mad. I've worked in some high acuity CVICUs and those cardiac surgeons can be the biggest assholes. But when it comes to my patient I have no problem speaking up and advocating for them.\n\nFamily or visitors are something else though, or sometimes the patient themselves. I don't want anyone to be mad at me, to feel like I'm stupid or incompetent at caring for their loved one. When they are abrasive and confrontational and crass I become so nervous that I can't give an explanation or stand my ground. I'm also scared they'll go to management and make a complaint about me and I'll get talked to about my atittude if I talk back to them.  \n\nFor example I had a homeless patient in the ICU because he was in heart failure and on drips, went to the ER because he knew his heart was bad and he felt bad. He could still get up on his own and move around with the IV pole. I was working nights and the day nurse told me he basically cleaned out the patient kitchen. He continued asking for drinks and food for me, and was also on a fluid restriction that he went way passed. I mean like 3 apple juices and 2 ginger ales at a time, then 2 mac and cheese frozen dinners at once. Aaalll the graham crackers and pb. He ate so much he made himself vomit, which he also did during the day. At one point I said bud I don't think you should have any more if it's making you sick like this. He asked for more and I said no, you need to get some rest tonight, you've already gone over your fluid restriction, you haven't slept all night. Well he flipped and started yelling that he was signing out AMA and didn't care about his heart. I said I'll speak to the doctor but if you really feel that way then you just have to sign a paper. This set him off even more and he got out of bed saying he doesn't have to sign anything, I can't make him do anything or keep him there, was cursing at me. I said I'm not trying to, it's just an AMA form that everyone signs saying they know they're leaving against medical advice. He started getting his clothes and putting them on so I went to the charge who was also the assistant manager. I said my guy is trying to leave but he's screaming he won't sign anything. She was so nonchalant about it and said well we can't keep him if he wants to go, we can't block him from going. So I asked if I'm just supposed to let him walk out even if the doctor isn't aware yet and she said basically. I went back to my pod and he was still yelling at me to get in his room and take his IV out or he'll rip it out himself. The unit was pretty open because there were only curtains on the rooms, not doors, so all my neighbor nurses were witnessing everything. So I looked at another nurse and I think she could tell I was panicking because she just looked at him and said \"wouldn't recommend it but go ahead if that's what you want.\" I said I'd speak to the doctor to see if I could get his fluid restriction changed. He kind of calmed down then so I went to my computer to text page because that's how the hospital worked, and he didn't know that so started screaming that I better pick up the phone. That pissed me off so I said we send a page online not on the phone in a firm and irritated voice.\n\nSo anyway the doc comes and is basically begging him to stay, \"what can I do to get you to stay, please don't go.\" And that turned into the patient saying \"if you give me oxycodone to help me sleep then I'll stay.\" The resident ordered it and said just give it which blew all of our minds. The fact that I got screamed at and threatened and the doctor gave in and gave him oxy is absurd.\n\nBut that whole incident shook me. I didn't want to go back in his room, I couldn't stand up for myself in the moment and say don't yell at me, or I'm calling security, or anything like that. I just stared and said \"ok.\" \n\nDoes anyone else feel like they're just too sensitive? Or how can I get my thick skin 😭\n\nAs a side note I've recently come to realize that some of it may be a trauma response because my parents yelled a lot during my childhood. Like crying, screaming fights that made me cover my head with my pillow. I've always been afraid of getting in trouble or rustling anyone's feathers",

I’ve now been with Davita 7 months and I’m already job hunting now and ready to put in my 2 weeks. \n\nI just want to vent my frustrations. Acute dialysis is great in many ways, a lot less stress and the job itself isn’t hard. But DaVita is so scummy that I can’t take it anymore. \n\n•First of all, the pay isn’t great, I still am making decent money in general since I moved to California but it’s a lot less than other nurses her. I know for sure I should be making more. And the on call pay is a slap in the face, $75 for weekday and $100 for weekends. Not even an hourly rate increase or any pay while waiting all day and night just to be called, you can only clock in and get paid once you’re called. And no weekend differential yet weekends are required. \n•this brings me to being on-call. I wasn’t a fan but didn’t think it’d be that bad when I was hired. It is! So I work 3 days a week in the day time, go in at 0600. To be considered full time you must work 3 days with an additional on-call shift once a week! And I’m usually called so I work 4 days🙃 Our on call is overnight, 1800-0600 and can get called at any time, and on top of that, to be full for a day you need 2 patients, you can refuse or take a 3rd but thats optional since it typically puts you over 12 hours in a day. I’m currently at work and was on call earlier in the afternoon (I got called at 1500 which happens sometimes because they are inconsistent and don’t always wait until 1800), and I left around 11pm because I had no other patients. Tried to sleep but got called at 2am and I said I was so tired I didn’t think I could do it, and they said since I only had 1 patient this day that im required to take this one or I’m considered “abandoning the patient”. Mind you I already spent the whole day yesterday awake because I’m not used to working nights anymore and can’t nap in the day time so I was up all day anxiously awaiting to be called in and now I’m just exhausted. And the pay is a joke. \n•inconsistent and unfair treatment. Some nurses here have arrangements where they work 1 shift coming every afternoon time so they don’t have to be on-call. If you work Night Shift every shift, there is no on call, but the two nurses who are on the schedule for 1800 NEVER come at that time, they come in at 0600 and just never work on call or nights. And one nurse who was hired before me said when she interviewed that she was told on call was every other week, not weekly like me. I just am newer but I will definitely be better about what kind of questions I ask in my next job interviews. I don’t want to be take advantage of. \n•I’m not sure what the schedule is like for nurses at other Davita regions but in south LA, it sucks. They don’t have a proper system and we just email someone our days and I rarely even get the days I ask. On top of that, they LOVE to give me one day off or two days and it’s rare if I have 3 or more days off in a row despite me asking. I am feeling so saddened by this. And we have to work rotating weekends but I keep getting more Saturday/Sundays than other people and I mentioned it before but the excuse was “lots of other nurses are on PtO and we are short, sorry”\n•I asked about opportunities for raises and did the extra training and education to qualify. I kept getting told we get raises quarterly, june is supposed to be it. I asked my manager multiple times in June and when she finally got to me, she said she will need to verify the rate still with upper management and that it will take effect some time in July. I barely get replies from her and I text and email about this multiple times. It’s July and even if I get my raise I am so over it already. \n•my final biggest complaint is my manager sucks. Some hours were missed from my paycheck TWICE and I’ve only been there 6 months. First time I accepted the accident because it was my first week and ended up getting the pay on the next paycheck. Recently I mentioned to my manager multiple times that I forgot to punch out and wanted it fixed before the pay period ended and she kept saying she would but of course it was forgotten and then she apologized and said she would add it to my next pay check. My manager consistently forgets things I ask and I don’t feel supported. \n\nI am ready to jump into the world of travel nursing and go back to bedside. I need more freedom and even though I know it will be tough, I just can’t imagine being more stressed than I am feeling now. I don’t know if I can handle ICU again though I know I doubt myself too much and know I did a good job, but I’m hoping to try med surg, tele, step down travel. Local contracts hopefully. I am feeling so discouraged about this career. I want to cry. \n\nI know this is long as hell but I needed this off my chest and if you read, thank you. If you made it this far, one quick question. If you smoke weed, do you take breaks before applying for jobs to pass the drug test or do you do any other methods lol? Asking for a friend on this last one…",

    "text": "Saying \"Catch a Bubble\" is now racist... At least according to my school's admin. A bunch of Kindergarten and first grade teachers were told that in a meeting. The teachers were completely confused because they've been saying it for years and asked for an explanation, but of course admin was not able to explain any of their reasoning behind it. One teacher (white woman) was specifically told that she \"doesn't understand the culture of the children (title one school, mostly African American)\" to which she reminded them that she is engaged to a black man and has a mixed race child. They didn't respond to that either and basically the teachers were told if they are ever heard saying it again, they would be fired. \n\nI tried searching this claim and found something about how it's equivalent to telling kids to \"shut up\", but even that seems like a stretch. Nothing about how it's racist. \n\nAnyone else ever heard this?\n\nEDIT:\nTo clarify: I don't think it's racist. I'm just curious if anyone has dealt with something similar with that phrase or another management skill with their admins trying to be \"white saviors\". Also can't believe that of all the issues my school should be dealing with, this seems to be the focus right now. We literally had a child bring bullets into the building last week and that's being completely covered up.",

    "text": "I was dress coded. Please advise. I, 19f, am a first year student teacher at a middle school. I was wearing a black high-neck body suit with black slacks from old navy. During planning, my mentor teacher told me that a male AP said that I was dressed “inappropriately” and that I need to wear looser clothes. My mentor teacher pointed out that she didn’t find anything wrong with my outfit but she just wanted to let me know. I immediately felt so embarrassed and uncomfortable because I put effort into dressing professionally and I felt like I was being singled out because many of the female teachers wear the same outfit and even more form fitting clothes than what I wore. My personal thought is the AP said something because my butt is big. I cannot control that. Even when I wear my baggy cargos to this school, my butt still pokes out. I just feel weird & targeted honestly. Please tell me if I’m wrong. Thanks.\n\nEdits for clarification:\n\n1. The high-neck bodysuit also has sleeves so no shoulders were out. The bodysuit just looks like a tucked in shirt, honestly. The reason I stated that I believe the AP made the comment specifically about my booty was bc I have a very small chest & my chest has never been a point of attention for me. However, my small waist & large butt combo has always been a point of attention no matter what I wear. \n\n2. I am able to student teach at 19 bc I earned high school credits in middle school due to being on the accelerated track + I dual enrolled during the pandemic, earning most of my freshman & sophomore credits for college before I even graduated hs. Lastly, I graduated hs a semester early. \n\n3. Yes I am in the USA.\n\n4. I am mixed race: Black, White, & Native American.",

    "text": "Parent teacher meeting ended in me getting terminated I had a meeting with the parents of the “Extremely violent, perpetually angry student.” For context, he has been placed in my intellectual disability unit even though he only has a diagnosis of autism, and wrecks the whole classroom and attacks everyone all day, every time he shows up to school, which isn’t often. \n\nThey were toxic. They came in 5 minutes late and hadn’t even sat down when they began to yell “You are NOT expelling our son, we’ve already tried every school within an hour from home and this was our last option.” Um, no you haven’t, you just refuse to get him transferred to alternative school. (Administration was supposed to supervise but didn’t show up.)\n\nWe went straight into talking about his extremely violent behavior, and they accused us of “racially profiling” their son because he’s a black latino adoptee from the Dominican Republic. Literally nobody brought race into it except them. (Note that these parents are white people.) I also brought up how he seems to be coming to school unwashed, and that he alone makes the whole classroom smell bad. Again, I was told “That’s racist!” \n\nI told them about how restraint is considered inhumane and how we can’t give him his prescribed sedatives, and I got told “You need to have better classroom management!” I have no idea why they blamed me when they already said that he acts like this at home too. \n\nLastly, I asked them to explain how I’m meant to do that when no strategy works and they just complain about it, and they cut me off and told me “If you continue to be so reckless, we ***WILL*** be suing.” They then walked out. We had an hour booked for the meeting, and they came in 5 minutes late and were only there for 10 minutes. They remained in the building for a while after though.\n\nSchool administration backed the parents and told me that I need to do my job better, and that they will be replacing me due to my “inability to manage violence”. Um, no, I was the one who asked both school *and district* administration for help and got ignored by both. I did show them the documentation I had on him, and they didn’t even read it. Instead, it turns out that I’m going to be terminated after this semester.  Administration didn’t even tell me what happened but I bet the parents ran with the false accusations of racism they pulled out of their asses.",

    "text": "Dismissed from a charter school. Here is my rant. I am one of the permanent subs that is filling open positions left by the nationwide teacher shortage.\nOn one hand, I feel like a scab. On the other hand, I make $30/hr and bill hourly to avoid the perpetual wage theft committed against certified and Masters level teachers.\nI'm sure my pro-union leanings and frequent reminders of \"this is why there's a teacher shortage\" whenever an unreasonable request was made didn't endear me to administration. Still, students suffer when they don't have qualified teachers and if that is ever going to change we have to address the reasons teachers are leaving.\n\nI do not tolerate bullying or disrespect in my classroom. I have ensured parents that my classroom is a safe place for their kids to learn. So, when I had a student constantly telling others they are poor, broke, ugly, stupid, smelly, etc., I called the office to have him removed. I did the same for one other student whose entire body language exuded contempt and disrespect.\n\nThe administrator who showed up at my door yesterday in response to the disruptive student proceeded to disrespect me further, blame my poor classroom management (I do not have a problem with my class, thank you, I have a problem with 1-2 students), complain that \"Level 1 behaviors\" were not worth his time, and then walked away from me while I was talking to him. What a dick. And clearly not the right man for the job.\n\nThere's more, but this post is long enough. I have mixed feelings about it all. Looking forward to something new. Sad I won't see my students again. Worried that all we've built and worked on will go down the drain with a new teacher. Disappointed that something I used to have a passion for has become so...this.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading my rant. Take care of yourselves out there.\n\nEdit to add: Of course I went through all the steps of redirecting, changing seating arrangements, having conversations about the behaviors and their impacts, contacting parents, etc. before involving administration.",

    "text": "Student cussed and yelled at me today after telling them to put the phone away \nI am a ELL instructional specialist/IC and I am helping a teacher with classroom management (not ESL but they still assigned her to me because we're understaffed). I was in her classroom and saw a student on the phone. Our principal has been very strict about the no-phone policy, students are supposed to put their phone in a bin as they walk into the classroom and only take it out at the end of the block. The principal has been reprimanding this teacher because of phone usage in her classroom, and since I am trying to help her and I don't want her to get in trouble, when I saw a student on her phone I told her to either give it to me to put it in the bin, or do so herself, like I always do in this kind of situation. She kept it in her hand so I stood there waiting and hell broke loose...\n\nShe started yelling at me, telling me to leave her alone, she called me a b*tch multiple times, told me to go f*ck myself multiple times. 2 of her friends intervened and doubled down, yelled all kinds of profanities, and also called me a racist (these students were black but so is 80% of the class and the other 20% are Hispanic students, she was just the only one I saw on her phone).\n\nIn the end she put the phone in the bin and I walked away. At the end of class, I talked to her 1:1 explaining that I am trying to help, telling her that the school is strict on the policy (which she already knows) and I don't want the teacher to get in trouble. She was much calmer, she said she understood, and she even smiled. Even so, I am very ashamed to admit that I have been shaking and my heart has been racing since that happened and once the bell rang I hid in the bathroom to cry. I feel so stupid for reacting like this but unfortunately I am autistic and this kind of direct confrontation really takes a toll on me.\n \nEven though I really enjoy my job, I feel like I have no business working in education because I am weak and not assertive enough and I constantly get disrespected and walked over not just by students but colleagues as well. I feel stupid because I think I handled this very poorly but at the same time I don't know what I could have done differently besides minding my own business. I just want to help this teacher because if she doesn't get this under control, she will keep being reprimanded by the principal and might get written up.",

EDIT TO ADD, Tell me why on EARTH this mom called the front office to ask if I’m having a Christmas party (I am) and if she could bring any supplies or treats???? A) everything’s been bought and paid for already..  and B) her daughter has already destroyed a picture a classmate made as a present for a friend, and pushed two other kids to the ground, and it’s only lunch. So yes mom, I’m having a Christmas party, but your kid will be having a conversation in the counselors office instead during that time. \n\nOriginal post— \n\nPlease convince me not to say anything to this mom, because I really want to.\n\nMore info in post history, I teach first grade, and today we squeezed in an IEP eligibility meeting before we go on break tomorrow. I’ve been pushing for this since week 4 of the school year, researching, documenting, trying different things to help this kid while still in my room, but her behavior is like nothing I’ve ever seen. She will smile in your face, tell you what you want to hear, and as soon as you’ve turned your back, stab her neighbor in the hand with her pencil. While you separate, attend to the victim, reprimand/ redirect, she’s laughing and saying “whaaaaaaaaat?”. There’s a lot more but that’s the tldr of her behavior. Mom went off on me in Week 6 of the school year, saying because of my race, I can’t teach her daughter. I knew the meeting today was going to suck, but I didn’t expect her to say so many times “her teacher won’t help her” “her teacher can’t hold her attention” “I’m blaming the teacher” “it’s the teachers fault”. So blatantly. \n\nIt just broke my heart. I’ve lost so much sleep over this kid. I plan lessons for her to do with a classroom aid every fucking day. I tried so many behavior management techniques, so many chances, candy, toys, special breaks, her favorite play doh, kinetic sand, walk breaks, lunch in the classroom with me, lunch with other teachers. And I’ve been documenting the whole way. But okay, it’s my fault. After the meeting, other staff members came to ask me if I was okay/ let me know this mom is crazy and they know it. It helped a little, I’m just so frustrated that I didn’t defend myself in the meeting. I knew I couldn’t without crying. It’s been a really, really, really rough year. Break day after tomorrow 👍",

I had taken some precautions before leaving by putting ALL of my personal belongings away inside lockers and filing cabinets behind my desk so students wouldn't get to them. I have this student, let's call him \"B,\" he has a history of stealing from me and other students. I'm not sure if he's stolen from other teachers but I'm sure I'm not the only one. \nI had left several boxes of cereal bars inside my fridge that's also behind my desk against a wall and B somehow managed to get to them and take them ALL. (Other students they had seen him with at least one box)  This is so frustrating because he has had consequences for his behavior before, the admin knows about him and he's been sent to an alternative education program school and when he came back it's like nothing even happened. The same week he came back I caught him taking a dollar from my desk and when confronted he lied to my face saying it wasn't him until I said \"B, stop lying to my face and give me back my dollar\" that he decided to give it back. \nI know, it was just a dollar and this time it was just three boxes of cereal bars, but I buy these things with my own money for students who go home hungry or don't get to have breakfast in the morning. If he wanted something to eat he could've asked me for some but he took EVERYTHING, there was also fruit roll ups and other fruit snacks in the mix. It's just so frustrating... I'm going to call his guardian later today and see if anything changes but I don't know what more else I can do. I heard from other students that said things like \"I'm going to take her coffee mug next\" he's turned this into a challenge for himself and I don't know what else to do anymore ...",

    "text": "Is this violence normal? First year 6th grade history teacher needs advice This is my first year teaching. I'm 6th grade US History. It's been just over a month. I'm at a rural, low income, high risk, predominantly black school (the last part shouldn't matter, but I'll explain.) I was warned by hr when I was hired that the kids have behavioral issues and to reach out if I wasn't being supported. \n\nIn my first week, there were multiple fights in my class. One student threw a chair at my screen board. The students actively told me they were trying to get me fired, would lie to the admin, and were misbehaving to get me to quit. Of course, I told them that wasn't going to leave and to cut it out so we can learn. \n\nOver the month, most of the students have calmed down. Some enjoy my class and are actually learning. About a third are still being rambunctious. They curse in class, bully other students, don't do their work, refuse to sit in their assigned seat, still throw things. There's been multiple fights in my class too. Another teacher asked one of those students why they only act this way in my class and not for any other teacher. He responded \"because you're black\". (I'm the only white teacher in the grade).\n\nI'm also having issues with their IEPs. The SPED teacher hasn't been following their accommodations so most of those kids are failing. Yet I'm suppssed to provide read aloud accomodations to a student who doesn't have an iep. I have referred this student for evaluation twice and have been ignored. I also had to restrain a student with a 504 because she was charging at another student to fight them. I reported my use of restraint, but the administration didn't report it to the state as required. \n\nI've told admin all of this as it has happened. I've asked for disciplinary policies and procedures for when kids are being violent multiple times. The admin hasn't been able to provide any direction besides call the parents. Well I do that and it does nothing. The parents say they'll discipline, but they come right back doing the same stuff the next day. (BTW, our class phones don't have outbound call access. I have to use my personal phone...).\n\nThe admin scheduled a meeting with me this week saying I need to learn how to manage my classroom because writing 10 referrals a week is bad. I explained everything above again and asked again for assistance in doing that by receiving written policies and procedures. They claimed this was there first time hearing about it (lie) and provided nothing.\n\nThey said I need to have better lesson plans that engage the students every minute. I offered to pull up my lesson plans to show them that is done. I also explained that we haven't been able to complete the activities I do plan because of the behavioral issues. \n\nThey proceeded to tell me that they didn't have these issues before I got here, basically saying these kids are violent because of me. I reminded them that the kids have said they don't respect me because of my race and are trying to get me fired. The conversation continued to revolve around how poorly I'm doing. I reminded them that I am an emergency provisional, untrained, uncertified teacher and that I need support. \n\nEverything I suggested was given a no. We don't have security to call. I can't call the police. I can't send disruptive kids to the hall. I can't give them worksheets to keep them occupied. They refuse to suspend kids and if they do it's not for more than a day. ISS is usually only used for that class period and they return for the next. \n\nIs this normal? Admin tried to tell me this is how it is at every school and I need to just get used to it. \n\nI truthfully don't know what to do. I enjoy my job. The \"good\" students enjoy my class. The other teachers tell me I'm doing a great job. \n\nI can't stop thinking about how they are blaming me for the violence. These are long standing behavioral issues that are happening in every grade at the school. If the worst were to happen, a school shooting imo, I have no way to get help. I wouldn't be able to live with the fact that the adults blame me for the violence. \n\nI'm not sure what to do and I need advice. I can reach out to HR, but that will strain my relationship with admin more. I'm planning on sending a recap email of the meeting with my questions about procedures in writing. I make good money, but the districts closer to my family are paying more...\n\nShould I look elsewhere? Should I try to make this work? Should I escalate to HR? I truly don't know how to handle this.",

My support teacher was out that day due to a family emergency and I am running around with like a chicken with its head cut off. \n\nAt my performance review I get so much... constructive criticism. No \"you're doing great\", \"congrats on trying to teach and doing it decently without anyone dying\", \"good job.\"\n\nJust comments on how students were on their phones (we have no cell phone policy in our school and no support from admin on discipline in any way), one student just copied the notes from the online answer key, you let the students go to the bathroom too often, you should have done x, y, z. \n\nAm I saying that I don't want constructive feedback from an admin that has been a teacher for 15 years up until last year? No. I know I am new to this and I am not the bestest teacher in the world with everyone being a perfect angel. I need support and to hear what can be improved. My problem stems from never being told I'm doing a good job or that despite all the bs that happened I still managed to teach and not have any crazy problems. \n\nI am so exhausted and tired of being treated like crap from students, having no admin support for discipline and being expected to implement all these \"amazing, new PD things.\"\n\nAdmin always gives more work and overloads us with more PD and more students activities we have to attend (forced to attend).\n\nI also don't have a window in my classroom (like numerous other teachers in my school) so I'm also just depressed living in a cave.\n\nJust tired of this job and ready to move on.

    "text": "Am I a piece of shit for considering crossing a picket line? I'm 33 and living with family and need to be paying rent soon. For the past 3 years I have managed to avoid all of the heinous inflation by living in a shithole part of Texas making \"good money\" for the area. After a nervous breakdown I was going back to school and looking for work while living with family.\n\nI finally managed to find a job in Seattle making 20 an hour and its just not possible to budget rent into the mix with all of my other finances (Car, insurance, groceries, medical insurance/doctors visits etc.) because at the end of the month I have 60 bucks leftover for \"savings\". Even after trying to tighten the belt and adjust spending, and I'm talking rice and beans and cheap protein style food budget, I still only come up with 300 a month in savings.\n\nNow the schooling I got was in healthcare and there is a strike in San Diego that I can go and make 75 an hour plus overtime for a few weeks and make 6-8k in that time which will give me a nice safety net of six months to look for a higher paying job (Which I've been doing for the last 6 months). But that idea GREATLY compromises my values and belief systems, as I believe unionized workers are the strongest force and should be supported. On the OTHER hand I don't want to be homeless and living on the street. No parental home to go to, just my one sister I'm living with at the moment and she has pulled the trigger on having to pay a grand in rent each month or be given a notice.\n\nSo what's the play, what do I do. Would I be a ginormous flaming piece of shit for crossing a picket line, or is it justified for my survival?\n\nEDIT: To say that crossing the picket would be temporary, as would the contract. I would not be crossing to take the job over entirely, and would not be permanently relocating. The company would pay for me to show up and work and leave after 2 weeks or if the strike ends early and will be paid for any missed work just not at the same rate. I also currently live in Seattle, which is where my family lives and I am living with them. \n\nAnd final request to all of the white knighters and those calling me a piece of shit, what would you do to come up with the rent and utilities to not be homeless?",

    "text": "9 hour work days, barely scraping by, im going to become homeless. I'm exhausted. Ive been working 9 hours every day for quite some time now and I just can't do it anymore. My job is fairly physically demanding and very mentally demanding. When I get home, I'm so tired I literally fall asleep for 2-3 hours. I get up early, get home late afternoon and I'm too tired to do anything. The days are just merging into each other as when I'm not working I'm either asleep or barely awake. I'm becoming fucking miserable.\n\nNow if this was the only issue, then I could manage. I'm not opposed to working hard for decent stretches of time, but it has to be worth it. But it's just not. I don't even earn enough per month to support myself. If it weren't for the fact that I'm fortunate enough to have a family that let's me live at home for cheap, then I'd probably be homeless. \n\nIt's not like I'm bad with money or am looking at apartments out of my range. I frequently go on hitchhiking trips for months on end where I wildcamp and pretty much only spend money on food, if I'm not dumpsterdiving. I live out of only a 30-40L backpack for ages and I'm perfectly happy. I don't need many things or comforts to be happy in life and I'm very frugal. However I enjoy the comforts of modern life occasionally and don't want to live like a bum all year round. So I return home, work for some time, save up money and head back out on the road again. \n\nBut I think I've finally had it this time. I'm working so goddamn much and getting so little it's not even enough to support a half-decent quality of life. If I weren't content being a dirty hippy half the time, then I don't know what I would do. I will never be able to afford to move out on my own or fully support myself.\n\nI'm in an impossible situation. I can do a course that will up my salary, but if I do that, then I'll likely get the boot because then they'll have to pay me a proper wage, and my employer is strapped for cash. Happened to one of my previous coworkers. They gave her the boot because she was too highly educated, so they couldn't pay her. They love me however, I work shittons, have plenty of experience, I'm good at my job, and they can get away with paying me fuck all. It's not even like I need the course, Ive learnt everything it teaches through experience already. If I do the course, then my work won't change, I'll still be doing the same stuff. So basically I'm being played less for the same work, just because I don't have this silly formality. And if I were to actually go get it, then I'd likely get the boot as they could no longer afford me. I'll just be \"educating\" myself out of a job. I just can't win.\n\nI'm just so done. It's unbelievable to me that I can work this much, with such high phycial and mental toll and not even be able to independently support myself. Thank god that I have a good family that lets me live at home for almost nothing. If not for that I'd literally be working 9 hours a day and living on the streets.\n\nSo fuck it. I can work 9 hours everyday, almost all year and not have enough to support myself and get miserable and depressed and not have enough energy to enjoy my free time and feel like I'm wasting my life, or i can I can be homeless and work seasonal jobs and small gigs every now and then and be free and have time to do what I want to do and be happy. I know how to live cheapy on the road without many possessions. I don't need much money. I'm learning an instrument, so I can probably get by with busking for a few pennies and dumpster diving. The comforts of modern life just aren't worth it. I'm working my arse off and aging 10x faster just to be miserable and barely afford a decent standard of living. Sleeping in the dirt might get old eventually, but at least I will be happy. Living like a homeless person is much more enjoyable than spending my time grinding away at the rat race to spend a few hours in the evenings half asleep at my PC trying to enjoy some videogames. A little gaming, a kitchen, toilet and a proper bed just isn't worth it. I'll take a night by a campfire any day, over a proper bed that I had to bust my arse to afford. Crazy thing is that after an entire day hitchhiking from dawn till dusk, walking 8-10KM everyday, I am not nearly as tired as I am after work. So fuck this shit. When my next paycheque comes in, I'm hitting the road again and this time I'm not coming back.",

    "text": "If things don't change soon this country might not survive the next decade. America is centuries behind the rest of the world when it comes to workers rights. We have put up with this nonsense time and time again. we continue on and on with this neo-slavery model of the rat race. Humans are no longer longer seen as humans with emotions, differences, aspirations, character, families and community's but rather a tool for corporations to exploit. America is designed to make you go crazy. It may not be now, it may not be 20 years from now. But if you continue to put up with the 80 hour week model a lot of us endure you will go crazy at some point.\n\nThe most minuscule medical diagnosis could set you back thousands of dollars. It is at this stage you realize the hospital is not your friend. At your weakest moment you will be given a bill which will mean you will have to put extra hours in at the office. So you finally graduate school, and you think your position in life will finally change but again...you are handed a bill which of course means you will have to put in extra hours at the office.\n\nSo decades pass and you think you finally see the light at the end of the tunnel but suddenly your rent goes up by a few hundred dollars. You must yet again...put more hours...in...the....office.\n\nNo matter how much you work no matter how hard you try the slightest inconvenience or mistake can set you back years if not decades. The American dream of vast acres of land to be explored and tamed to your liking is over. If you are lucky you will be able to sign up for a 30 year loan with 5% interest rates on a 500,000 dollar home somewhere moderately safe. But most of us will have to settle with room mates and the unlucky ones might have to sleep in their car or a motel. We have an entire generation of men, woman, and children with almost zero stability from month to month. Our future is uncertain and we are at the mercy of those with more power, more resources and more connections. \n\nIt is the equivalent of joining a game of monopoly at the tail end of the game and being told \"Pull yourself up by the bootstraps! You can win if you just put your mind to it!\" Those that are very lucky might be able to buy a plot or two but the vast majority of us will go completely bankrupt with nothing to show for it...just as the game intended. \n\nAnother thing that people forget is that as we dedicate more and more of our lives to our jobs the less social, family and community ties we will have. Hanging out with friends becomes increasingly more difficult. setting aside time for a family event becomes impossible. Having time to meet your neighbors or spending a few minutes to chat with people in your community becomes a chore. A lot of us are simply hanging by a thread if hanging by anything at all. Every second counts in todays world of hustle culture. You spend 8 hours sleeping in preparation for work in the morning. Then you spend a further hour in the morning preparing yourself for work. Then you spend another hour driving to work. Then you spend a further 8 or more hours at work. then another hour driving home in high stress rush hour traffic. If you are lucky you might get a couple of hours at the end of your day to do as you please. But in the end you will never really enjoy it because in the back of your mind you know you are going to have to go through the same anxiety riddled scenario the very next day. \n\nIn an ideal world people wouldn't fear waking up in the morning. People would look up to their boss as a leader and the worker would be comfortable traveling from point A to point B without fearing death. Commuting to work should be paid by the company you are working for. If they cannot afford to transport workers to their job then they should be paying enough taxes to build the appropriate public transportation.  America has become Disney Land for the rich and an open air prison for the poor. You have to pay 2000 dollars or more for a drivable car just to get to work when that money could go to a stable non stress inducing transportation system. Nearly 70 percent of drivers have driving anxiety. Why is so much of our life dedicated to something that makes us scared and fearful? Humans weren't meant to drive 2 ton vehicles going 70 miles per hour. For those of us that do not feel comfortable doing so there should be alternate options. People that are incapable of driving shouldn't be cut off from the rest of their community and forced to walk hours at a time to get needed jobs/services. If you live in Michigan you would know it is a city built for cars, not people and it is a nerve wrecking nightmare. The only construction that is taking place here is for cars never for humans. The roads are also undrivable filled with massive potholes that can disintegrate your car in an instant, and you will have to spend thousands on maintenance. so yeah...fun right?\n\nI do not know how much longer the American worker will continue to take these unfair conditions. Most people do not have anyone to talk to because we have dedicated our lives to work instead of each other. There should be a 25 dollar minimum wage to compensate for all the things I just mentioned. Workers should not be spending half their income on housing and the other half on transportation. We need to start demanding those in charge start designing a livable society that doesn't require being in the top 1 percent to enjoy. How has our standard of living fallen so far since the 50's...I'll tell you why. Mismanagement, inequality, bad planning and corporate greed. Why should the people in charge care about the roads when they can just use their 2 million dollar helicopter to  take them to their 8th mega mansion? Meanwhile the ones that work under them are walking tens of miles to work because unfortunately owning a car is becoming increasingly unaffordable to many.\n\nThe commoners have had enough. Mental wellbeing is at an all time low. You can not have a functioning society with this many problems being swept under the rug. This is the first time in American history the new generation will grow up poorer than the old generation. Wealth is usually passed on but this time there just isn't anything left to pass on... The only positive thing I can say about what is happening here is that it may be a lesson for future generations to prevent this from ever happening again. People are just starting to wise up to the absolute chaos that is this so called \"economy\" that slowly sucks the life out of you day by day and you are expected to sell a piece of your soul every time you head in to work. So enjoy your freedom. The freedom to be at the mercy of your boss. The freedom to be at the mercy of your landlord. The freedom to go bankrupt at the slightest medical inconvenience. The freedom to drive a 2 ton vehicle on highly convoluted and overcrowded roads. The freedom to lease your labor to a corporation and never own your own creations. The freedom to be paid an unlivable wage that guarantees poverty. The freedom to give up family, friendships and community in favor of meeting deadlines. The freedom to pay exorbitant bills to multi billion dollar companies that see you as a resource. The freedom to delay retirement a few decades because you have been working your whole life and still own nothing. The freedom to \"buy\" a house by signing a 30 year loan. The freedom to go to school and be buried in student loan debt. The freedom to work your entire life for a company expecting a promotion just for them to replace you with a robot at the drop of a hat. The American dream is just that a dream. It's time to enter the real world and address the problems we have been ignoring since the 60's\n\n1. Provided food and housing for all that work full time (No one should be working and homeless)\n2. Safe, accessible, and low cost public transportation for morning commutes. (People should not be forced to drive just to go to their local grocery store)\n3. Equal distribution of corporate resources/profits amongst the workers.  (Workers should each be given a percentage of the profits made by a corporation. Workers should not be doing all the work and be given a tiny percentile of profits)\n4. Public healthcare system that is affordable (Anyone who is working should be able to be healthy while they work. No one should be working while unable to afford care for their bodies)\n5. A realistic and fair way to achieve the American dream (Start family/House/College)\n6. Give all workers a voice in their company's. (Democratize work force. Everyone gets to vote, disagree, or agree to workforce policies)\n7. Minimum wage of 25 dollars an hour adjusted each year for inflation ( Every year workers will be paid a livable wage no one should be working 10 dollars an hour while their CEO is making 10 million)\n8. Better safety protocols in the workplace (People shouldn't put their health/safety at risk just to meet insane quotas)\n9. Guaranteed vacation for at least 1 month out of the year. (We should be working to live not living to work)\n10. Transparent hiring practices (The current method of hiring is shameful and disgraceful to the worker. No one should have to show up to 5 interviews and take 2 hour long test just to not even land the job. Hiring should be transparent for the applicant. If you are denied for \"Having too much experience\" or \"Not having enough experience\" The employer must compensate you for wasted time. This will give more of an incentive for companies to actually hire applicants rather than just waste 100 applicants time just to hire no one. The requirements for the position should be listed beforehand and if the applicant meets all those requirements and still isn't hired the employer should give reasons why. If they can't give a valid reason they should compensate you for wasted time. The current job market has completely alienated job seekers. it's time to put an end to companies lying about high wages to applicants on the job flyer just for them to show up to an interview and being told they would only be paid 8 dollars an hour. In a fair market this would be seen as fraud and false advertising. But because we care so little about workers companies are allowed to get away with this unbelievable behavior. And they wonder why no one wants to work?)\n\nThat is it. I hope that some of you took in what I have said. After years of suffering on dirt poor wages and living in the rat race I am finally starting to see it for what is really is. A scam. Everything is designed to funnel money out of the workers pockets, pull the roof from over the workers head, and take food out of the workers mouth. If you think working will make you happy you haven't been paying attention for the last 50 years. The worker is being hit from all sides and it is up to us to stand up as a class and say enough is enough. The alternative is to keep living as indentured servants to your chosen bank or corporation. Is that truly a life you'd like to live? To die of old age knowing you wasted so much on so little? At your final moments you look back on all the years wasted trying to keep up with the never ending expectations and demands put on you by our unequal economy. Having the rug pulled right from under you before your last breath. You realize it was all a scam. The American dream is just a dream. All the real world experiences you missed out on to chase the imaginary label of \"success\" but at the cost of your fulfillment, wellbeing and mental stability. Your boss doesn't show up to your funeral. Neither does your land lord, manager, banker, insurance agent, CEO, bill collector, etc. The only ones that show up is your friends and family that you've been ignoring all your life, chasing a lie. You are buried shortly after and the company that you worked for, for 50 years quickly replaces you with no mention of your disappearance. Ready to start the process all over again with the next sucker. The exploiters laugh knowing that you died owning nothing all while their wealth expanded exponentially. This is a fair system... but only to those at the top of the scheme. And you let them do it.",

    "text": "I just got let go, and I'm scared out of my mind To keep a long story short, this Monday I was employed at Mcwane Ductile in Provo, Utah. I was a union member, and unabashedly fought for my fellow factory workers rights (expressing dissatisfaction to management, teaching working rights to coworkers, etc). I loved being part of the union, as it was my first union, and supported everything they could get us (Utah laws basically strip unions of any teeth). They did their best, and it was awesome\n\nBack to Monday, my manager comes up and says I need to stop working, I'm not an employee anymore, and that he doesn't even know what's going on. We head over to HR, and as we are walking, he tells me that they had terminated my file instead of the girl who quit last week, and that they might just let me go because I had already put in my end date for the first week of October (health issues had come up since we switched from 4 10's to 4 13+'s)\n\nWhen we get to HR, they immediately are trying to convince me that I can voluntarily quit, and me and manager shut that down. My manager asks if they can just include me in the layoffs we had a couple weeks ago, so I can get unemployment, and the head HR lady, obviously upset that I'm not just quiting, says they can make that work, and that was it. I was escorted out and jobless\n\nI immediately was like hey this is great, instead of quitting and not getting unemployment, now I can survive of the government for a while before my next step in life (going on an LDS mission, I Don't want comments on my religion or my choice, this is a worker issue, not religion), but after it's been a couple days, I feel pretty scared. I leave first week of Nov, and I won't have any insurance, any protection, and I'm going to have to lie to get unemployment (Utah requires you actively look for 4 jobs per week). If I can't properly lie, or have a medical emergency, or if the government shuts down, I'm screwed. I will lose everything I've been working for for two years\n\nTo add to that, I'm scared for when I get back from my mission (again, no religion comments). I don't want to work in a factory anymore, but I still want a union. I want to do UX design, and a lot of those jobs don't currently have unions, and I don't know if I can fight to install one. I'm 20, and I'm already tired. I feel like it's different with the current big unions (UAW, Sag Afta, railroad), where there's already huge powerhouses that can support you if you fail. I just don't know if I can justify jeopardizing my future education, family, house, and retirement, for other workers even if I desperately want to. But I know I'll be screwed over by future companies, I mean I was screwed over by a unionized employer!\n\nIdk why I'm writing this. I already know you all hate this stupid rat race too\n\nTL;DR got layed off due to company accident, feel scared and lost about future un-unionized employers and how I'm going to survive until then",

I’m not sure if it’s a mix of my ADD, some underlying depression and anxiety that I have, or I’m just quick to pick up on the BS of a company. Could be all 3. I leave my job reviews on job boards clear as well for anyone thinking of joining a company.\n\nThis particular new job I’m in is hospitality at a park, stockholders want all profits so our park can’t even hire a full time employee, only seasonal and part timers. Usually 3 days a week, not that it matters to me since I’m a student. Problem with this is that greedy stockholders make workers overworked and understaffed, therefore taking those 3 days available and stuffing it with long hours (10-14 hours) which just sounds miserable to make up the hours covered based off of my eavesdropping on other workers my first day on the job. I’m usually an advocate for 10x4 and 3x12 schedules but not for workers who are having to clock in at 3 AM and finishing their day off at 2-3PM to do it again or get an unstable 5-6 hour shift the next day because you are capped out on hours. Also what’s shady is that my manager schedules me a certain shift but wants me to leave an hour or two earlier than what’s on my original schedule. My hours on paper looks fine but getting Paid less as an illusion?",

    "text": "Was I the victim of quiet firing, or was I just a bad worker? I'll preface by saying this is an alt account in the event future or previous employers decide to look into me on social media.\n\nIn October of 2021 I was hired at a health food/supplement store, the manager and assistant manager were very friendly and I loved the assistant manager even up until I quit and I still view her as a good friend, like a work grandma almost. The manager was a very chill (usually) guy, with occasional freak-outs in his office over what I assumed were phone calls. Let's call him Bill and the assistant manager Eden. About a week into my time at the store, Bill and Eden had found out I am a transgender man (male to female, pre top surgery at the time), due to my banking information being the same one I had before I transitioned and having my birth name on it. They didn't seem to have a problem with it, and I typically kept to myself about it anyway, only mentioning it to people once I felt comfortable enough with them, and eventually all my coworkers (all women) knew about it.  \n\n\nI wanna say it was November 2021 when Bill got fired, and nobody ever told us why. This is when the vitamin manager, let's call her Anne, stepped up as store manager. I'd never had any issues with Anne, I figured she liked me. The only two things I can think of for possible cause to believe she discriminated against me was the fact she was catholic, and she took down a pride flag Bill had placed in the window due to sun bleaching. When I asked Anne if she wanted me to bring a new one (I worked at a pride shop before, I could easily get one just down the street), she told me she \"didn't want people to feel like we were forcing it down their throats\". I thought it was odd since nobody had a problem with it before, but whatever.\n\nFast forward to around November 2022, we hire a new girl to \"replace\" someone in vitamins who was about to go on maternity leave. This entire question was sparked by finding my old schedule from this month, in which the new girl, let's call Julie, had a little more than 3 TIMES my amount of hours. Now maybe it's just how that worked, new people get new hours, but even the other woman with the second least amount of hours still had double my hours. I had 27 hours in the entire month of November. This went on for months.\n\nJulie never even got trained for vitamins, she just kept the same title I did, grocery assistant, but continued to get more hours. I should mention in October of 2022, I had gotten a second job which I still currently have, and I adore the work and the people. I'm always told I do a great job, that I'm one of their best workers.\n\nAnne had the opposite view. At least once a month I was pulled into her office to talk about my performance issues. At one point, I was given a warning because a customer complained about me not helping them. I was busy at the till with 2 other customers in line, I have no idea where my other two coworkers were, probably busy as well. I broke down sobbing in her office because I genuinely had no idea what I'd been doing wrong the entire time, especially with my other job praising my work, it felt like I was being directly bullied. \n\nThe job was mind-numbingly boring most days, and consisted of a lot of date checking. Pick up product, look at date, put it back, repeat. For 4, 6, sometimes 8 hours a day. Good news is I am now super good at naming months by numbers so, take that for what you will. This mind-numbing work did not help my mental state either, as around February to March was when the warning was given to me, and during this time I had just been in a car accident, broken up with my fiancé and my mom was newly diagnosed with breast cancer. Anne never really seemed to care, saying basically \"everyone has stuff going on, you need to not bring it here\". And while I know you aren't supposed to mix work with home, it's extremely difficult when the only thing you do for hours a day is look at dates and listen to your own thoughts to drown out the repetitive oldies playlist playing over the speakers.\n\nMy final straw was when I came into work on one Sunday, I believe in May, and found an \"approval for second job\" in my box. Anne was asking me for approval for a second job I'd had for 6 months, which did not directly interfere with my hours at this job, and was not a competitor. The only reason I had even told her about my second job in the first place was because I had a set schedule on weekends, which was flexible to suit Anne's need for me to be there. The way Anne put it, \"we are your first priority\". I don't know if that's true, but I had to listen to her or I wouldn't have any other shifts, which were already dwindling as it was. I showed the form to another coworker who said Anne had no right to do that, and she had never even seen the form before despite her working there for roughly 10 years. \n\nI didn't give my two weeks, I was done. I wrote that day was my final day, said I quit, and left it on Anne's desk. I finished my final day with my coworker and haven't stepped foot in the place since.\n\nIt always had me wondering if the constant evaluations and chats about performance were genuinely from me not trying, or if it was something else. I'd been doing exactly what she'd told me to do, and it was never enough. I'd never heard a \"good job\" from her, while at my other and current job I'm constantly told \"thank you\" and \"you did awesome\". A few of my other friends have mentioned it may be discrimination due to me being transgender, or possibly just LGBT in general, but I don't have a lot of evidence to back that up.\n\nI'm not really sure what I want out of this post, maybe an answer to what was happening? Why it happened? What I could've done better? Maybe just to explain what happened. I dunno, but either way, thanks for reading.\n\n\\*\\*\\*  \nTLDR;  \nMy old boss was replaced by a new one who cut my hours and was subtly not for LGBT (I am FTM transgender). Hours were given to a new person, I've been told my performance was low several times, and I was asked to fill out a form for permission to have a job I'd already had for 6 months.",

    "text": "Liking what you do x Better compensation \nTL/DR: I'm expecting a job offer in a couple of days that potentially can give me good salary bump but for a role more boring that I have today. \n\nI've been in my company for about 5 years and it is getting harder to have meaningful compensation reviews. I applied for a new job to focus on better comp but I believe I will get bored really easy. How to define if I should focus on money or liking what I do?\n\nHere are some aspects to help with the comparison:\n\nTotal comp: I am expecting a 20% raise in the new role and even though I didn't get the offer it looks like they will match that. The new offer will be sent next week but my current comp is about to be reviewed this or next month. I already mentioned to my manager that I'm expecting a salary review since I'm having great impact in the team and had a lot of good feedback but I expect something around 5-10%. Also bonuses are better defined in the new role.\n\nBenefits: I'm not sure yet about the new offer but the ones I have today are quite average and I might have room to negotiate better ones in the new role. \n\nRole: My current role is a mix of sales, customer success and strategic product development. I like what I do but I find the customer support/training part quite tedious. The new role will focus more on the parts I think are boring and also I won't have as much impact in the strategy of the team as I do today. \n\nCareer progression: I currently report to the CEO of my company and my career path is a bit unclear. However, the product we are building is growing and we are seeing a lot of interest in the market and from potential buyers/investors. I have some stock options and eventhough we are not actively looking for investors it looks like in an year or two we will have some investing opportunities which might lead to salary bumps and more important roles. The new role is in an older company that have more stablished processes and it has a more standard career progression, less start-up-y. \n\nHybrid work: My current company has a hybrid situation that I quite like and the new role will allow for even more flexibility. However, I plan to move to a situation where I would work 3mo abroad per year and the new role already let me know it would be possible. Haven't discussed this with my current manager but I know they won't like it eventhough it is a possibility as other people have similar arrangements. This is a big thing for me as it has some personal aspects involved. \n\nInternational trips: I currently do a couple of international trips per year that are quite interesting but of intense work. It's a good way to visit new places without paying and I won't have that in the new role.\n\nEmotional: I love the product we are creating and I want to see it grow and be a part of it. I fear the FOMO I might have if I leave now, since we are in a steady grow stage. It has a potential to disrupt the industry we are in and we already reached some interesting benchmarks of SaaS products, proving the potential of it. I could even keep using the product if decide to leave, make some extra money on the side and keep the relationship going, but with way less impact.\n\nI thought about using the new offer as leverage to negotiate my salary but I fear it might jeopardize the relationship I have with the CEO and it is a hard conversation to have. \n\nI appreciate any advice! \n\nCheers",

    "text": "Approaching $100k salary as an IT warehouse manager, started at $28k 5 years ago. Hate my job, would I be an idiot to quit? Backstory: Started out as an IT field tech a little over 5 years ago, when Covid started I moved into our warehouse and started working as a supervisor. Fast forward to a year ago, I was promoted to an Ops Manager managing our warehouse, field techs, and a team of project coordinators. While the pay increases have been nice and has allowed me to live a comfortable life(got my own place, new car, etc.), I absolutely despise my day to day life and dread going into work daily.\n\nHere is my dilemma - this was my first job out of school, I do not have any other job experience. I have an associates degree in a completely unrelated field, so I can't use that to leverage any future opportunities(I also have no interest in finding a job in that field). \n\nI do however, have a passion for project management. While I do not currently have any certifications, I do manage multiple projects/clients daily. My current job is a mix of people management, project management, and customer service. I absolutely despise the people management aspect of the job, I used to be compassionaite when people had issues arise, but I feel like I've grown bitter and am turning into one of those managers who just wants the work to be completed so I can go home. However, I absolutely love the project management and customer service aspect of the business. I am very process oriented and love making our business more efficient to ensure our customers are happy.\n\nI am sure I could spin my current job duties into project management experience to potentially get my foot in the door, but I do feel like I would need to take a step back pay wise, and potentially in my career as well. I do have some friends who want me to relocate to the west coast as well, which I am super interested in, so that just fuels my fire a bit more to get out of here.\n\nI do have immense guilt as well though, I feel like I am in a wonderful situation(pay/career wise, not happiness) with my current company, and they have invested tons of time, money, and effort into growing me as a leader. I would essentially be throwing away the last 5 years of progress we have made together, which makes the decision even harder. I would basically be throwing their investment in me out the window.\n\nAny advice?",

I might mix them up and send the wrong thing to the wrong thread. I COULD have scrolled down to the original message to double-check myself, but so often, I don’t even do things like this because I think, “I’ve got this” or I’m essentially on autopilot and don’t even stop to question myself. \n\nI stop and explain to my manager why things like this happen, and how I can fix them (setting up conditional formatting on my outlook to automatically differentiate these by color). \n\nYet— the root cause is still there. I feel like I’m working with 1% of my brainpower sometimes, and the rest is just trying to keep me working and on-task. Everything seems right as i do it…I don’t really feel capable of checking every aspect of what when all I can hold in my mind at a time is one step at a time. \n\nI’ll correct the wrong information because i got two very similar regulations mixed up and set a vendor on the wrong course.

Corp work is too much like HS and it’s exhausting\n\nIf you think about it, working an office job is like the perfect distillation of high school the adult version: it’s all about building relationships, having allies, kissing ass, cliques, etc etc. everyday feels like I’m back in school cafeteria tryna find a table to sit at when none of my friends are around. \n\nI don’t like office politics, although tbh there isn’t too much of that outright at the place I work. It’s more subtle and just revolves around how much the manager likes you = how much of a “push” you get. You can work your ass off and contribute a lot to the daily grind in the market, but if the boss man doesn’t vibe with you, you just get kind of frozen out.

    "text": "Director just scheduled a random meeting with me - am I right to worry? Hi Reddit.\n\nSo I just got an email from a director who scheduled time into my diary tommorow for a half an hour catchup at lunch tommorow - which is strange, considering he never messages me or anything. In fact, I havent even met him in person. \n\nI sent him a message there asking if I was in any kind of trouble, and he replied saying 'Hi, We will discuss Tommorow at the meeting'. And now my anxiety is going through the roof, and my mind Is racing about what it could be. \n\nSome thoughts are:\n- I haven't really been coming into the office all that often, because I haven't been given any project work so it often bears no difference  to me if I'm in or not. In addition I have anxiety which required me to take off work for a time and attend counselling, and report to occupational health regarding it.\n- My manager frequently ignores my messages asking about project work & upskilling opportunities in the meantime. \n- about a week ago, I told my career advisor these issues and he had a chat with my manager. Now all of a sudden a director wants to chat with me about presumably something negative. \n\nAm I going to get sacked? Or get a written warning? It's worth noting that for the year end review, I got a significant bonus, and was in the second highest tier for performance. So I'm just wondering what this could be about and I'm shitting myself.\n\nUPDATE:\nSo I had the meeting, it went well and was professional all things considered. They told me that going forward, they are restructuring the team and they are approaching members of staff firm wide to make a severance package offer. It is very significant financially, with other benefits such as setting up a service for updating my CV, and they would still give me a reference. I can also choose to deny it. In all honesty, I wanted to change my job anyway as I wasn't happy in it for the longest while as it was, and I've been half-assed looking for other work. And because I have significant savings as it is, I feel like it's the best choice because even if I say no, they will still have a review and determine if they will enact a compulsory redundancy package, which I think pretty much means they will get me out one way or another.\n\nI actually feel happy and content with the news, because apparently it wasn't brought about by poor performance or gross misconduct or anything like that - as I mentioned  above I had a strong year-end and high performance tier with a bonus too, so I didn't get reprimanded or cussed out. It would be the push I need to find new, satisfying work In the end. Either way I'm just glad it's over.",

    "text": "Is it normal to be this overwhelmed? Hi everyone, I’ve been at my company for about 1.5 years now. It’s my first real office job that I started in my last semester of graduate school, so my transition from school to work was pretty fast. The problem I’m facing is that my company is small and had some really impactful employees quit last fall, including my previous supervisor that I really got along with, so I’ve been doing the jobs of ~3 people since then. I cover assignments that range from administrative to financial to developmental, long-term planning and short-term scheduling, with some supervision thrown in as needed. At the end of the day, my brain is buzzing with information, I’m not getting restful sleep, and I’m waking up anxious to look at my emails and workload for the day.\n\nThe problem I’m facing is that, with this being my first adult job, I can’t tell if me being overwhelmed is a sign that something needs to change with me or if I should start looking at different options. I’m generally a more introverted person and I’m managing a couple of chronic conditions. We work from home 95% of the time so that helps to manage some of my personal life, but I’ve been tasked with leading trainings, speaking engagements, and meetings where I don’t feel like I’m the best fit due to some stage fright and anxiety. \n\nA recent example of this: I had to lead a 3-day training in-person on a project I’m fairly new to. I was given a lot of responsibility for preparing/ finalizing training materials, hands-on activities, invoice documentation, and follow-up with participants. This led me to pretty much have a mental break after the second day since I’m not used to leading a large training and the environment was less than welcoming (mandatory, 4-hours a day, mix of lecture and discussion). \n\nI’ve talked with my supervisor about framing these tasks as opportunities to grow, but I don’t want to keep pushing myself this hard if it’ll result in chronic stress (which I’m afraid is already happening). \n\nSo, should I hang in there to try to grow as a person/employee or is this a sign of things only getting worse?",

    "text": "Early career Software Developer looking for a career change in a different industry. What should I do? English is not my first language so apologies in advance if this post doesn't completely align with how typically questions are asked here. But I will try to keep it as concise as possible. So here it goes,  \n\n\n**My Background**\n\nI graduated from a top University in Canada with a Double Major in Computer Science and Economics but I primarily gravitated towards Computer Science and opted for a career in Software Engineering. I did not graduate in the best of times (thanks to covid) but after a few months wait, eventually got placed as a junior java developer. I worked there for almost a year and honestly, I did not have the best experience. However, the more I reflect on my bad experiences, the more i question myself whether or not everything that contributed to my bad experience is specific to the work environment or my own flawed perception of what \"WORK\" would be as a Software Developer. I hated the morning stand ups, the constant fast-paced sprints (especially joining as a junior developer. Sometimes it would take me close to a week to even understand what's going on in a ticket and bam its already week 2 and deadline is coming and i am all stressed). Unless I am completely off, I understood that any development team that is working around a product will have such pressure from management as the cost of a product not working in production is massive to the businesses that are involved. I would have mild panic attacks every morning before standups since everyone seems to have their shit together and in general, I just kind of hate the format. I would much rather give updates 1v1 or on via messages and get in calls on when needed. In general, I am not the type of person who likes to talk in the room unless it is absolutely required. Also, for some context, even though I was a junior and it may be due to a lack of experience but when I saw my senior managers on-a day to day basis, I did not look up to them. They are amazing and hard-working people, but I did not want that life 5 years down the line even if things went right on my part. I eventually quit. Moving forward..\n\n**Search for new career**\n\nI have also thought about development teams that work in R&D or something similar (that is not closely tied to a product). I still haven't had the chance to experience what working in a R&D team would feel like so any input on that is always appreciated.  \nslowly over time, I realized more and more that in general, I like to code. I would often spend hours watching a conference on a new tool/framework or just about anything related to software Engineering in general. I switch between some of my pet projects sometimes and wanted to make a game for commercial purposes but some (or most) of them died out amidst my search for jobs for a living and the stress that comes with it.  \n\n\nAs a result, I started doing some research on how I can leverage my skill/love for Software Devlopment in a way that would let me stay connected to the field but not in a agile/scrum environment where the stress of work takes the joy of the field (for me at least). Looks like there is not clear answer to this as freelancing is a race to the bottom, any kind of work related to Academia requires unusually high Academic credentials to even be considered as a potential applicant, starting a small software company on my own is a different ball game (open to the idea but no clue where to start). Lately, I have been thinking how I can get into slightly non-technical or completely non-technical role where my expertise as a Software Developer may come handy but for most of such jobs, I feel like I am over-qualified for any of the technical help the job may require and under-qualified for the non-technical skills (Maybe some people are meant to enjoy Software development only as a hobby?)  \n\n\n**My skillset and conclusion**\n\n  \nSo, I am quite in the dark right now when it comes to looking for a new career. I can only work in Canada for now. However, I am open to relocating to any province for the right job. Any input/suggestions based on my post is highly appreciated. I need some guidance from people who may have been through something similar or have the knowledge to shed some light on this. Thank you!  \n\n\n\\-Worked as a Java Developer for almost one year and familiar with spring boot, backend development in general (and some database work too)  \n\\-Did quite a bit of Machine Learning and Data analysis in school and work (read numpy, keras, pandas, power BI, some excel).  \n\\-Quite a few statistics and Econometrics courses (both intermediate and advanced) along with other Economics and Finance courses as part of my Economics major.

What I did was take the advice to feel comfortable saying “I don’t know/that’s a good question/let me help you find out.” At first it felt uncomfortable admitting I didn’t know, but I always made a point to go out of my way to assist our junior interns, even if that meant me asking a senior dev to hop on a call with us together when we were at a roadblock. Realizing they are probably also nervous helped me too, as I focused on making them feel comfortable asking me for help. It’s still not easy, but it’s getting much better.",

I truly appreciate each one of you taking the time to respond to my post. Your input has given me confidence that I've made the right decision.",

    "text": "Hot Tip: Seek a Small Office I keep seeing posts about how everyone hates their life in public or industry and thought I would share my experience. Not saying these jobs are abundant but this is what I did and it has worked out well so far (13.6% raise 2022, 25% raise in 2023).\n\nTitle: Property Accountant\n\nOffice: Asset management office (40 employees, 30 corporate, 10 superintendents)\n\n* Look for a company where the CEO/President is young. You want to get in on the ground floor of the next generation. Currently me and the VP (future president) are the youngest in the office.\n* Work hard, but work harder on your relationships with your coworkers. Nothing is more important than how your coworkers see you and how your bosses respond to you.\n* Identify a company with a poor tech stack that is transitioning to new tech.\n* Identify a company that has a workforce which is skewed to a very old demographic. My company average age is skewed to like 50-55.\n* Learn everything you possibly can about that tech once hired. Accounting is your 9-5 job, but you're gonna focus on breezing through that to get time to work on releasing new tech processes.\n* Your value is tied to automation and rolling out new modules. Don't ask for more accounting work. If anything, try to give up accounting work for more tech work. Accounting is literally a race to the bottom. I see all of our accountants take on more and more work and they don't get rewarded for it. Our value is in being a key employee to the company, not a slave that takes on more and more grunt work. \n\nTl;dr: General takeaway is focus on tech, not accounting. Being the best at a small company is a much better reward payoff than being a good employee at a multinational corp. Focus on your work relationships. If you leave and morale goes down it carries a ton of value. Negotiate, negotiate, negotiate.",

    "text": "One partner's perspective on what the profession will look like in 5-10 years Obviously nobody has a crystal ball, but I believe the shift over the next 5 - 10 years should be significant but manageable. AI aside (I'll touch on that later), technologies with more advanced capabilities have existed for many many years, and they're finally finding their way into our softwares since firm leaders are finally opening their purses, for fear of buzzword headlines that constantly call out the accounting profession as a top candidate for disruption.  \n\n\nTax Now - the major tax software providers have a tough enough time keeping up with all the annual tax changes, which has made it challenging to also invest in developing more advanced capabilities. But over time, most tax applications have at least moved to \"the cloud,\" which allows for better integration with more advanced tools. Current tools making waves are ones that reduce the Data Entry pain referenced in the other thread.  \n\n\nTax Later - Gradually, client systems, practitioner systems, government/regulator systems, and respective supply chain systems will hit a point where they more seamlessly interact together. A comparable-ish example is when Money Intelligence created connections to banking systems to pull over transactional data for personal finance analysis. They were renamed Mint, bought by Intuit, and that functionality was added to core accountant products like Quicken & QuickBooks, and the IP paved the way for new TurboTax capabilities. The technology making that all possible existed for many years beforehand, but it took time to navigate the \"human\" side of things, like making appropriate investments and collaborating/cooperating across corporate borders. Now that path is cleared and most the big software players can do it. Such integrations are being added to tax-oriented tools every day, paving a new way of doing tax one innovation at a time.  \n\n\nTax Implications - Tax as a specialty expertise isn't going anywhere soon, nor will it ever not be complex. The tax code is how legislators subtly exercise their power and influence behavior. In the unlikely event federal taxes get easy, there's always state taxes. And local taxes. And international. And payroll. And property. And sales/use. And tax planning/strategy. The tax prep landscape is evolving, but it'll continue as a secure field of expertise for the foreseeable future.  \n\n\nAudit Now - audit also has a lot of time into data-related tasks. At the lowest staff levels, more hours are put into obtaining records and preparing them to be auditable, than hours put into actually auditing them. Tools like ACL and IDEA have been around for a long time to help. But most accountants suck at IT that isn't Excel, so tools currently making waves are ones that are embedded into Excel. The \"methodologies\" our firms follow to guide/instruct our engagement teams are evolving to incorporate these tools more, and \"Audit Data Analytics\" is a key buzzword for the thinkers of our profession, like the AICPA and FASB/GASB. ADA is a rabbit hole in itself that I'll pin for now.  \n\n\nAudit Later - the major working paper software providers are moving their tools into the cloud (I call them \"Gen 2\") and enable more integrations with standards, methodologies, and third-party tools. But (1) they're expensive, (2) they don't yet work for all industry segments, and (3) most big firms with deep pockets made significant investments in their \"Gen 1\" tools/methodologies that will be difficult to walk away from, politically amongst partners, and logistically across their geographies and thousands of practitioners. Firms with agility will pave this transition.  \n\n\nAudit Implications - owners, boards, investors, lenders, and other stakeholders will not start accepting corporate reporting at face value anytime soon, so external assurance is a secure field of expertise for the foreseeable future. But a full audit that happens once per year and takes months to complete is going to be laughable in the market of the future, which will demand more sophisticated analysis completed faster. We'll analyze data from more systems than just the client's financial softwares, we'll have requests out to even more operational business units, and we'll synthesize it all faster and generate a more comprehensive view on whether corporate reporting actually portrays what's happened/happening - be that financial reporting or other type of reporting (see the \"ESG\" buzzword that encapsulates so many varying non-financial concepts).  \n\n\nEverything Later - the CPA profession recognizes a lot of the tasks/processes that take up much of our practitioners' time will be replaced or made easier because of new tools and techniques. That’s what drove the \"Trusted Client Advisor\" campaign years ago, rebranding CPAs as focused on the areas of our work that provide our clients with the real value, so folks don't just see our services as a commodity or think of us as only helping check off some compliance boxes. Pretty much all firms started bulking up their advisory/consulting practices again, reminiscent to pre-SOX times.  \n\n\nAdvisory/Consulting - this is a separate book for another time.  \n\n\nAll New Staff Implications – I want accountants to graduate school and make big bucks, because we’d all benefit. Perhaps a challenge is that new graduates don't really know/do enough to \"give the value\" to \"get the value.\" I believe their development into capable tax/financial accounting experts who can “give the value” is hamstrung by them needing to work long hours doing data entry and document manipulation. And everyone loses, because overall budgets for new hires is already quite high at firms. I hope these new technologies will help them learn and work on the actually lucrative part of the business on an accelerated timeline, to both increase their starting salaries, benefits, and raises, while also reducing firm 'investments' in employing data entry laborers who largely leave before ROI. But staff will need to be trained in the tools, which is what's drove that \"CPA Evolution\" concept, rethinking everything like what it takes to earn an accounting degree, pass the CPA exam, and ongoing CPE requirements. Much of the focus is technology.  \n\n\n\"AI\" - every few years there's a new buzzword, and I could talk endlessly on each. I've long thought machine learning models would eventually be the most impactful to the services CPAs offer. Large language models (like OpenAI/ChatGPT) are exciting because they're the first time most of us are getting to experience this technology. But this technology has so many more capabilities beyond generative text. Some among us who use GRC tools for SOX control testing are seeing generative text LLMs being embedded to help write targeted control descriptions, testing steps, and findings. None of this will replace us - it will just be one more component helping enable everything I've been discussing. AI won't make accountants obsolete, but accountants who don't leverage AI tools won't stand a chance.  \n\n\nOne thing I want to mention while on the topic of AI is it's important not to confuse Narrow AI with General AI. It's very easy to see something like ChatGPT and let your mind race into inappropriate or currently impossible applications of the tech. It's understandable and natural to do so. I experience that with non-technical business leaders all the time.   \n\n\nSuggested Tips - the most important buzzword to you as an accountant is Data. Get better using Excel to mess with data. Master new tools your firms push to your machines that help modify/clean/analyze data. Consider learning Python in preparation for when Excel adds native support as Microsoft recently announced. Get exposure to ETL tools like Alteryx. Mess with Power BI - not to make pretty charts, but to understand how to get data chart-ready.  \n\n\nConclusion - I could go on forever but this seems like a good spot to stop. I imagine nerves during the dawn of personal computers, equipped with tools like spreadsheet applications, allowing us to do more and do it faster, was similar to the nerves of today. But imo this is bigger.  \n\n\n\\*\\* It's a very exciting time to be an accountant. Especially a CPA, since we're all investing together and pushing/pulling each other forward. No other career or profession is readying themselves for whatever is to come quite like ours. And we're not just readying for it - we're cooperating to actively drive what that future will be. \\*\\*",

    "text": "First accounting job going completely wrong I was hired at a residential remodeling company for what they told me would be AP/AR. They needed help managing these tasks because there were missing payments and other issues going on. Before anything happened, I was very clear with the CEO (who interviewed me) that I had zero experience in the field, but he still agreed to hire me.\n\nOn my first day, no one helped or guided me on what I was supposed to do. They purchased QuickBooks and basically told me to do my thing. This was shocking to me because it was the first time I had used QuickBooks, and although it's not hard to navigate, I am clearly not qualified to use it. That same day, I learned that no one keeps track of anything. There were multiple folders in a desk full of receipts from who knows when, and when I linked their six bank accounts to QuickBooks, I realized they used the cards for literally everything, mixing different categories and not keeping things organized, and some of them with a lot of bank fees for NSF.\n\nThe second day was no better. I sat at my computer all day trying to figure things out, unable to ask for help because no one knows how to do this stuff. It was just me and their architect in the office. Later, I found out that they also want me to learn how to do federal and state taxes eventually, and also do the company’s taxes.\n\nToday is my third day, and I am still completely lost as to what I have to do. I can't ask for help because pretty much everyone works outside most of the day, and they don't really know how to handle all this either. I've been coming in every morning and just sitting with my computer trying to figure things out as I go because that's all I can do. Today, I learned that the CEO of the company thinks I am a CPA when I clearly told them I just graduated and have zero experience. I am not a quitter, and I really want to learn, but they are expecting way too much from someone with zero experience, and this is stressing me out so much. They think that just because I went to school, I already know how to do everything.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add that they also want me to manage the other 2 smaller businesses they have :(\n\nEdit 2: CEO also expects me to learn how to do payrolls and set up meetings with multiple banks and work something out to get a loan for a couple hundred thousand dollars.",

I never clicked with my primary manager either, so she didn't bother to defend me. No pip - just fired.\n\nI've applied to a few dozen tax positions now and have been rejected by all which I had never experienced before this. Last time around, I got a nearly 50% response rate when applying to tax roles. I'm guessing it's seen as a major red flag that I was only with my firm for 8 months and got the boot right before tax season, that I'm so incompetent or whatnot that a firm fired me when accounting is usually mass hiring before busy season.\n\nI'm not really sure what to do from here. I feel mixed about continuing in tax and started applying to some financial analyst jobs - every analyst role I see gets hundreds of applicants though, so competition is pretty fierce, and as someone with experience in tax, I will definitely not be given the priority for those roles.\n\nAny advice or suggestions from here?

    "text": "Tips for interview Hello community, I just thought I'd give some tips for people who are currently job searching and attending interviews.\n\nI decided to make this post because I've noticed many candidates making the same mistakes. I am a Finance Manager for a private equity-backed company in the UK. We're looking to hire a second finance person to help us with accounting (including month-end) and some FP&A.\n\nHere are my tips:\n\n1. Please, never read directly from your CV when asked about your background. I've interviewed around 30 candidates so far, and 90% of them made this same mistake. These candidates also provided overly long answers, causing me to lose interest and engagement in the call. Instead, provide a brief summary but never read straight from the CV!!!!!!  \n\n2. For those whose first language isn't English - please pronounce the words completely even if you are not sure 100% how to pronounce them correctly. I've encountered many individuals who were difficult to understand cause they don't pronounce the word entirely and also talked very very quickly like there are in a race or something.  \n\n3. Always challenge the interviewers with thoughtful questions about the job. This gives a very positive impression.  \n\n4. Always indicate that you are interviewing with other companies. It will increase your perceived value.  \n\n5. Avoid Overselling Yourself: This can create a negative impression for the hiring manager. It's essential to share your achievements but refrain from excessive bragging.  \n\n6. I understand that often, to qualify for a more senior role, you might \"decorate\" your CV with work that you haven't actually done in your current role. This could be a strategy for job progression. However, please ensure you've conducted thorough research about the tasks you claim to have undertaken. When the hiring manager asks you about these tasks, be prepared to provide a concise answer detailing the actual steps you would need to take to complete them.  \n\n\n**Will answer any questions in the comments.**",

    "text": "Excel CAN Be an Accounting Program Last year, I interviewed with a small (think 10 admin employees and 20-25 production employees) company for an A/R position. The hiring manager was super friendly, and the CEO came in on my second interview to get a better feel of me as a prospective employee. The CEO is very involved in her business, as she grew it from the ground up and took pride in it. She was very intimidating, and this was my first time talking to her. \n\nShe asked me if I had any experience working with accounting programs. I told her no (keep in mind that I actually said the word “no”) but that I was highly proficient in Excel and I’m a fast learner when it comes to new programs. \n\nCue me fighting back tears from anxiety as she lectures me that Excel is NOT an accounting program and it will “never be used by any company worth their salt”. \n\nShe offered me the job on a 3-month trial.

    "text": "Racism in accounting, especially in PA. Is it just in my head? I’ve been at three different companies FT (started in Big 4, moved to industry, and left accounting for finance) as well as two companies for internships since I graduated from college 5 years ago. \n\nI’m not sure if I’m playing the race card here, but I experienced micro aggressions from my white colleagues when I was at the Big 4 and never from anyone who wasn’t white. Not sure if it’s due to coincidence since most folks I’ve worked with have been white, but at my next job in industry, my boss was from my cultural background (as well as my boss’s boss’s boss) and during my time there, I was promoted twice in 3 years. \n\nAt the Big 4, my team was pretty cliquey and I often found myself excluded (along with two others who were also minorities but were staff like me) from lunches and inside jokes. I just couldn’t click with my team since I’m more on the introverted side. \n\nEventually I left my industry job for a high finance job, where I was the only woman on a 12-person team (which consisted of 10 white men). I wasn’t close to anyone other than another analyst, who was the only other minority. Culture was also like the big 4. \n\nIs this all just in my head that I’ve felt that many of my white colleagues have been subtly discriminatory and expected me to bend over backwards for them? I’ve found that I inevitably end up chatting with the other minorities whenever we’re at work functions. Even in my industry job where I felt accepted, I was working for the only other minority woman. \n\nTLDR; I have found myself stagnating in teams that lack diversity/support for diversity. Bending over backwards for teams with homogeneous management has been the only way for me to keep my job, and I’m exhausted. I never felt distressed/bullied when I worked at my industry job with a fellow woman from my cultural background. I’m targeting diverse teams from now on even if the pay is not a high. Is this all in my head? \n\nAlso the one awesome mentor I’ve had who’s white ended up hitting on me even though he’s married after I left the company, but that’s neither here nor there 💀",

    "text": "Lessons learned in 3 years of consulting I never really wanted to be a consultant so going to a big 4 company  was a huge step for me which I don’t regret at all and I count the 3 years I was there as some of the most impactful of my career. Just like many of you I learn by doing not book learning. Being ADHD and Dyslexic I see the world a little different than others. As a Solution Architect and Security information and Event Management lead it was a natural role for me as it utilized how I see Data as it ingresses, egress and moves lateral in a modern Ecosystem and how to implement it into some of the largest Data Networks in the world which was amazing and truly fulfilling. Like I told them when they hired me “My oath did not have a expiration date, even though I retired I still want to serve!” And they let me do that.\n\nBeing a data guy and a Vet I am a copious Note taker and wanted to share some rules I learned over the last 3 years.\n\n**Character is important:** We live in a world where every word is recorded, misinterpreted and lawyers go over every legal agreement and statement of work to make sure both parties are protected. To me I took a simpler approach “I give you my word that my team and I will help you” and so I did. I did not care about the white noise of the world but focused on keeping my word as that was their expectation of our services. At a certain point all the consultanting companies are the same so the clients just wanted to have confidence that we will do what we say and keep our word. Honor and Integrity are not concepts to be pulled out when they need something to be negotiated but are core to who we are as people and the company we represent. Do what you say and say what you do. Keep it simple. \n\n**Listen First, Talk Last:** The people I met were some of the best in the world. Day in and day out they are in the thick of the storm fighting the good fight. When they want to employ a consultant usually they have already figured out the solution but just needs us to validate or execute it as they are still in the storm fighting. I always told my folks “we are like the Coast Guard and they are the leaky boat in the hurricane. We fly in and help them patch their boats, give them a new motor, help them with their navigation to realign them to a true North Framework then we head to the beach for Mai Tais and volleyball until called again but they stay in the storm hopefully with a better boat then when we arrived.” They are always in the storm so listening first and understanding their challenges will help us integrate and help them with their challenges as we bring industry insight to them to hopefully stop them from bailing water all the time.\n\n**Lead, Don’t Manage:** This is ingrained in every NCO (Noncommissioned Officer) from day one. We are only as good as the people we work with. In a world where loyalty is based on the Fiscal year and the greener, shiner object across the street by leading your people and truly showing them that you are there for them they will work for you and stay with you and not be tempted by the grass is greener on the other side of the street. I am truly proud that I had one of the lowest attrition rates and a huge success rate while I was at EY but very little was me but my team pulling together as a team. Forgetting the normal politics and focusing on being part of the solution. Harry Truman once said “You can get a lot of things done if you don’t try to take credit.” They emphasized this on a grand scheme, and they all knew I was available 24/7 if they needed me and if need be I would jump in front of the bus for them over and over again as that is what a leader does. Managers just look at the team as assets and resources to be discarded when done. A leader Drives the team to become a team and think beyond themselves and protects each and everyone of them so they can accomplish their goals and live their passion in their chosen profession.\n\n**It takes a Village, Not a villager:** One of the earliest and most heartfelt lessons I ever learned was EGO is the destroyer. I can truthfully say there was not one day I did not learn something from my team and the people I came into contact with. When I look at a global Ecosystem / network it is a like a symphony to me. I can hear if the drums are to loud or the horns are out of tune or if there is a rogue soloist trying to make a name for themselves. They all come together in my brain but the crux is there is order in the chaos and you cannot have a symphony / great work of music if everyone is not doing what they are supposed to be doing. Very quickly as people align to the same page the music comes from being discordant to a thing of beauty and amazement. No single person can do it alone. The maestro is nothing without the orchestra. Everyday you can learn something new and everyone has a place in the digital symphony we call a data network.\n\n**Remove Fear:** Frank Herbert really nailed how to deal with Fear in dune; it is the “mind-killer” and in a modern organization it can be disastrous to the enterprise. Fear has no place when data is the truth. In the military we used to say “We trust but we validate” When lives are on the line we don’t guess and we don’t make decisions in fear as it will cost lives. In the modern world remove fear and focus on character and data. Data is truth and character will guide you. There can neve be a situation where you fear for your job or not telling the client or boss “Truth”. The world around us deals in “fake News” we don’t. We focus on the data and we “KNOW” before we elevate or recommend. We never shirk from our roles as the data gods as truth is our watch word and the foundation of who we are. Fear is the mind-killer and in a job where we are paid to think, fear is nothing more than an anchor that will weigh you down and prevent you from being the best you are able, when ever you are able. \n\n**The right Skillset to the right role to the right outcome**: The world of a modern Ecosystem is a diverse as the stars in the sky and everyone has a different skillset supporting their roles to drive revenue for the business. We should always strive to understand the skills to accomplish a task and never try to shove a person into a role that that they don’t have the skills to accomplish the outcome or the role assigned. In SOCOM we are surgical when we build a team and understand every skillset and the strengths that guide those skillsets to the mission outcome. Everyone has a role to play and every skillset feeds that to the ultimate outcome. In the modern ecosystem we should learn these skillsets and roles to support. \n\n**Be Honest and Authentic at all times:** So many times people told me I was known for being “authentic and honest” and I enjoyed that but it ultimately led me down the thought pattern “well what are others doing.” So many people put on a face for a client or change who they are for the company they support. Stop it! The clients don’t want that and you don’t want that. What is the point of reaching the end of the race if you lost yourself in the race. Be you. You are knowledgeable and know right from wrong just speak your truth and it will work out. Usually people will respect you more for it than just being another person on a call. I remember one time I got feedback from a client “I don’t remember everyone else on the call, but I remember the guy with the hat and the swords, He really got it and understood our challenges.” (for those who don’t know I have a collection of swords on my office wall and I always wear a ballcap, it is me.) Never be afraid to be yourself (unless you are narcissistic Asshat than maybe you should get into another line of work and a different viewpoint of the world.)\n\nI have other lessons but these were the ones on top of my mind. A very long time ago a great friend of mine (was my XO at the time and now 30+ years later still my friend) gave me a book “About Face, The Odssey of an American Warrior” written by Col David Hackworth. I was a young man when I read it and one of the biggest lessons I learned from that book was he used to carry a green book and in it he would write things are good that he saw in leadership and things that were bad. I did that for 20 years of military service and I continue today in the private sector. These are my lessons that I learned and are not meant for any individual or company but life lessons that I reflected on as I continue my Journey outside of consulting (went Vendor specific). They are not meant to change anyone’s mind or call anyone out (legal disclaimer in the world we live in) but merely sharing my wisdom on my journey. Remember it takes a village and my village is the world as we all have a part to play in it and we are better together, being alone only finds you wandering in the dark screaming for help. (alone does not mean not being a individual for those who choose to pick apart my words.",

I had thought Consulting is all about long hours, travel, Client focused work. But so far, it has been chilled out days, no client related travel and delivering sub par deliverables set by the managers. I used to work in a startup and it feels like that was the most innovative stuff I worked on, in consulting it just seems like there is no work on leading tech and no innovation. I'm thinking to switch to Tech Industry, for more pay and better work.\n\nMy question is: In the long run, my assumption is SM, Directors and above make more. Is it worth it to exit Consulting and maybe think of returning as SM and above. Or am I wrong ? I work in analytics if that helps.",

    "text": "Am I being unreasonable? Or am I justified in feeling jaded? Hi everyone,\n\nTrying to get outside opinions on if I am being unreasonable/too prideful or if I genuinely have cause to feel misled. Long post, sorry ahead of time.\n\nTLDR: high-level graduate degree working for boutique firm for over a year and was lead to believe my quality of work would lead to a swift promotion. Review time comes around and I didn’t get it and later come to find out I was likely blackballed by 1 or 2 leaders for personal reasons while other leaders backed me. Likely inline for a promotion in a few months, but not to the level I hoped. Also receiving offers left and right but the grass isn’t always greener. I also realize my planned timeline is accelerated, but was hyped up to believe it is reasonable. Trying to plan next steps.\n\nI entered the industry at a boutique just over a year ago, coming from a very strong academic background, and quickly took to the job. I very quickly became independent, requested by clients, given teams of analysts, and basically handled all client presentations for my engagements. For context, it is unusual for our members below manager to get this much client presentation time or project management particularly with the partners I have worked under. \n\nGiven this is a boutique, I already came in with a lower salary than I could have commanded from a larger firm, but I was sold on the training, remote work style, and leadership opportunities which, to be fair, have mostly been followed through by leadership. However, my success in the firm has lead other team members and partners to refer to me as the “best mind” in the firm or “a rising star” and many of my 1:1s end with conversations around fast-tracking me to leadership or being a shoe-in for promotion with my “bright future” (SC or manager potentially given my responsibilities already) at 1 year. I probably drank the Koolaid a bit, but those are direct quotes. \n\nReview time came around at the end of the year which was about 10 months after I joined and I didn’t get a promotion. I got an ok raise and almost max bonus as well as glowing reviews, once again, but my experience was quoted a few times in holding me back and it ended with leadership essentially saying I am guaranteed (again) a promotion and big pay bump at the next review at the year half point. My frustration started to boil over given I essentially act as a manager on my projects and there were a few others (nothing personal against them) promoted above me that have fewer responsibilities or aren’t pulled on the difficult projects (or even come to me for instruction often). We have also had shifting sands with some team members in leadership moving elsewhere so there was perfect opportunity (in my mind) to move me up or even given me a trial run. My mid-year promotion would likely be to SC and then my sense has been it would be an uphill battle to get to manager now. Without waiting 1.5+ years.\n\nTo compound the issue, I had heard someone in leadership say a few things about me when they thought I couldn’t hear (after my review where I was clearly disappointed, but professional) along the lines of “we can’t promote him too fast and let other people think they can too” and “he should just be grateful for this job and not worried about more. We don’t need to bend over backward for employees”. To be fair, other leadership who are in my camp pushed back. \n\nTo some extent I can understand the experience point in a vacuum, but taken with the gushing compliments, ever increasing responsibility, and my academic background, I expected more. Perhaps it is arrogance. Meanwhile, I also have aggressive offers from other firms that I have tabled out of a mix of loyalty as well as wanting to advance quickly here before an industry transition. I’m largely wondering/debating if I should take one of these external offers to get to manager faster or if I should tough it out the next 2-3 months to my (hopeful) promotion and then be very upfront about my manager aspirations/expectations (which they are aware of) and go from there before jumping. At the very least I will have more leverage in negotiations. This also runs the risk of being shut down again.\n\nWhat do you all think? Appreciate any thoughts.",

    "text": "How can I use my IT consulting experience to get the heck out? Need to work in areas I am more passionate about. Hi everyone,\n\nLurker and first time poster here! Posting on a throwaway account because I am a weenie.\n\nI am 25 and have been 4 IT consulting roles through around 6 years. As I pursued each one of those roles, I had hoped that the different projects would kindle some sort of interest in the field again for me. However, the reality is that I burned out after my first year or so in IT. Since then, I have taken on more complex roles/projects and gained a fair amount of experience in a wide range of systems through BSA roles.\n\nI have become an introvert over the years due to my depression/anxiety stemming from horrible imposter syndrome. To my defense (not that I'm justifying it as something I shouldn't work on), I have always had imposter syndrome even as a child due to my very harsh bringing riddled with the worst kinds of neglect/abuse. Prior to my burnout, I was a very extroverted/confident person. It is important I note \"prior to my burnout\", because every since then, my job has been something that I feel controls many aspects of my life. It is not something I can \"turn-off\" in my head at the end of the work day because I feel trapped. This has led to me isolating myself because at the end of the work day/week, I am exhausted from putting on a fake smile and I no longer can be myself around any of my family (though I can a few friends). Essentially, I am exhausted and I cannot picture a sustainable future for myself in this field that is healthy for me or productive for my employer. While I get good marks/reviews, I feel like I am always sinking when trying to keep up with my teammates. I consider myself a pretty self-aware person and I have mediated on what causes these feelings. There is not an approach I can take that will make me happy in this field. I have been told that I have an uplifting and contagious personality, which is true, but it feels forced nowadays due to the cloud that hangs over me. I have considered working with people more, which I think would be great for me since that's something I could be somewhat confident in!\n\nI have a great deal of general knowledge on various IT areas, but when it comes to using those skills I am sub-par. I have always considered myself a better advisor/mentor type person as opposed to the person actually doing the work if that makes sense. I seem to be more confident when looking at the overall process of things. Kind of like a coach is to a quarterback.\n\nI am really wanting some insight on how I could line up my IT experience with exiting opportunities that fit my interests because I have reached a bit of a roadblock mentally. I think that project management/general management may be great for me, but I ignorant in that realm. When I picture myself truly being happy, I imagine owning my own business, or at the very least, managing/operating someone else's in a field that I am interested in for a moderate amount of pay and good work/life balance. When brainstorming on things I am passionate about or interested in, I really lean towards real estate (renovating/flipping/renting), cannabis (legal), helping people/animals, automotive, sports, sustainability, and a variety of other things. I am an active person and LOVE hands on work. Honestly, I'd love to just be cleaning rivers all day or something for a livable wage. I have quite a bit of debt or I would have already tried to start a business (though I do have an llc I started that I am not doing anything with).\n\n**Any ideas on how a lad like me could escape the soul sucking rat race of IT consulting into a field/role I would enjoy more?** Some more background is that I have a BBA, I have ADHD, and I have worked remotely in all of my positions.\n\nThank you all so much <3",

    "text": "Should I take the post-grad job offer? (3L) Hi everyone, I'll try to keep this concise but I'd appreciate some advice as I plan for life after law school. \n\nI'm a 3L who wants to ideally be a worker- and union-side employment attorney. My preference is to be more of a labor lawyer repping unions than doing civil litigation for individual employees, but both fields interest me. Also for context on salaries, etc., I live in the Los Angeles metropolitan area\n\nMy summer after 1L, I worked for Firm 1, which is primarily an employment firm with a small union-side practice. This past summer, I worked at Firm 2 as part of a fellowship. Firm 2 is a large union-side firm that almost exclusively represents and defends unions. Finally, Firm 3 is a smaller firm I live close to that also practices almost exclusively union law. \n\nI'm on the job hunt and antsy to get some security as to where I'll end up after the bar. Firm 2 liked my performance this past summer and invited me to be a spring clerk for them, but they've been playing footsie with whether they actually intend to hire me as an associate. The response has always been that they'll need to see where they're at closer to that time, and one associate told me he didn't receive an offer until the summer after he graduated. Additionally, Firm 2 is known for being a place where you go if you're so passionate about workers' rights that you're willing to work BigLaw hours without BigLaw pay. The people are great and passionate, though, and the firm is extremely well respected in the field. \n\nFirm 3 interviewed me a couple months ago and seemed to really like me. They made sure every partner talked to me, and even allowed me to chat with some of the associates privately. I get the sense that the pay grade isn't stellar, but the partners insist that the benefits are great and that everyone is very tight-knight. It's very conveniently located in case I need to go into the office, and it seems like I can work from home whenever I want. Plus, the vibe of Firm 3 is similar to Firm 1 in that everyone is very friendly and open. They told me they probably wouldn't get back to me until after the holidays, so I expect to hear back soon. \n\nYesterday, I received a call out of the blue from the managing partner for Firm 1. He offered me an associate position with a $100K base salary, + a discretionary bonus. The position would entail a mix of civil litigation and traditional labor. The drive to the office is long, but the position would also be as remote as I want it to be. Frankly, in this field, I never expected to be offered a starting salary in six figures and was taken aback (for comparison, the starting salaries of union attorneys I've been able to peep have been something between $60K and $85K). He told me it was a firm offer and that I had until spring break (more or less) to get back to him with a response. And while it's not the 100% union work I originally envisioned, I think I would be pretty happy with the position. \n\nSo, I guess I'm wondering a couple things:\n\n1) Do you think I should accept the offer now, or wait to see what other offers roll in before March? He assured me it's a firm offer, but I don't want to give the impression that his offer is the last resort when it's not. Plus the thought of knowing where I'm going to be at the end of the year (especially with a potentially pending recession) is very comforting to me. \n\n2) Should I tell Firm 2 about the offer? If so, should I do it now or wait a bit? If I'm worried that accepting the offer would cause them to not invest as much in my spring clerkship, what should I do? \n\n3) Would you choose a closer firm with work that's exactly what you want to do for *less* pay (probably around $80-85K), like Firm 3, or a firm with an office further away and work that's less directly related to what you wanted for more money (i.e. Firm 1)? (Keeping in mind that both firms would let me work from home almost whenever I wanted). \n\nI know a lot of this comes down to personal preference, but it would be really helpful to hear some other opinions on this from people who are going through the same thing and/or already went through it. And sorry for the long thread (this kind of feels like a final exam question, lol), I just couldn't think of a more concise way to lay it out. \n\nThanks so much, and happy new year!",

I would say that I am really confident in my skills and I do my job extremely well. I’ve been employed at my current position for 6 months. It’s a fairly big, super busy family medicine practice with 7 providers. For context I am the only black woman in the office and the place I work is heavily populated with Mormons . \n\nSince I started I have been constantly micromanaged by my lead. She is always watching everything I do, taking small matters and making them bigger than they are. Like I said I have over 7 years experience and am pretty well rounded MA, but since working here I’ve been made to feel incompetent. I never received my uniform pants that I was suppose to get at my 90 days , it’s month 6. Never received an update on when they will arrive , only thing my manager says to me about 2 weeks ago was “wow your scrubs haven’t arrived since I’ve been gone on vacation?” Shrugs her shoulders and says,“Well it’s nothing personal. “ whatever that means. Being micromanaged on top of working 10 hour days I can say I’m done and I put my two weeks in last week. A girl who was hired a month after me (who is Mormon and hired based on knowing the Dr who is also Mormon ) already received her uniforms and they are a way nicer than the ones I received. They also rushed to get her signed up with hospital portals and I still have to ask my co workers to print me hospital records which puts me behind when I’m rooming my patients. \n\nToday we had our meeting (I was a little late to the meeting as I was wrapping up with patients) My manager decides to bring up race. She said out of no where , “ just so everyone is clear we give raises and bonuses based on how hard you work  , not based on the color of your skin. We don’t care how much melanin you have. “ Everyone seemed confused as this should already be implied, it is common sense. It left me feeling extremely uncomfortable, and confused. I’m questioning if I want to complete my two weeks or just say good freaking bye to this place. FYI I have never brought up race in my place of work. I do my job and go home.",

    "text": "Child at my daughter’s school taken aside for a private discussion for “racism” towards me. Hey everyone, this happened at my daughter’s school this week and I’m kind of uncomfortable with how it went down. Would love to have some insight on this situation.\n\nMy daughter goes to a small school in our town where I volunteer in the library weekly. It’s my favourite day of the week, and I had a great time this week as always reading with and telling stories to the kids, plus getting to spend the day with my daughter. I got there a little early and since no one was in the library, I decided to go and paint with one of the teachers and some of the younger kids.\n\nAs we were painting, one of the little boys, let’s call him Miles, came up to us, pointed at the little bit of lace visible at the front of my wig and loudly said “Fake!” before he and his little brother sat down next to me and started to paint. I rolled my eyes, because kids are gonna be kids, and went back to what I was doing, but the teacher was clearly upset. She told him what he said wasn’t okay and made him apologize, I said it was fine he does that sometimes. She continued to tell me that didn’t make it alright, and started telling me about her experiences with racism growing up as an Indian woman.\n\nFor additional context I know this kid relatively well. I’m friendly with his parents, he’s friends with my daughter, frequently borrows her manga, and will generally come into the library to chat with me on the days I volunteer (translation: to show me his new Pokemon), read with the other kids and flip through whatever book I’m reading (he’s a very advanced reader). A few weeks ago at one of the school’s many events, a bunch of the kids and their parents were eating together and he said that he liked my hair. My daughter’s best friend said that it was fake. The school is very diverse and since a few of the black kids are either from mixed race families or have been adopted into white ones, conversations about my hair are frequent and sometimes the non-black kids join in. He asked what my real hair looked like and I told him that he'd already seen it several times.\n\nBack to the present, one of the other teachers (who was white) came up to me after lunch time and said that he and the other teacher were going to sit down and have a conversation with Miles about what he said and that it was important to talk to kids about racism. I said I didn't think it was necessary, but he continued to talk over me. If you recall my previous post about this school this is the same teacher who had been hitting on me, so I was way too uncomfortable to say as much as I probably should have.\n\nMy perspective on the situation is this. This kid wasn't racially stereotyping me, he has been present for multiple conversations about my hair, so he knew it was fake. He is a kid and is curious about cultural differences which is normal. I think non-black people have a different perspective than black people on what is considered unruly behaviour in a child. I also think non-black people think black hair is some kind of secret and are extremely uncomfortable talking about it or hearing it mentioned. I'm not.\n\nThe little boy is 7 years old. He's not white and comes from Middle Eastern/East Asian background, so there may have been an element of racism to the way the situation was handled towards him. He also made a comment about the first teacher's weight a few minutes after the one about my hair, so I also suspect that she just doesn't like him very much.\n\nAnyway, I'm curious about everyone else's perspective.",

    "text": "biracial (chinese and mexican) and feeling disconnected from AAPI community in the U.S Hello, it's my first time posting something like this but ever since I've started college it seems like there is a cultural group or community out there for everyone except for me. I'm F20 and my mother is Chinese and my father is Mexican. Both are first generation immigrants who met in the states. Everyone I know who is east asian and mixed race usually has one white parent. I don't mean to sound like I am excluding people but I think it's a very different experience to be biracial and nonwhite. I have friends who are east asian and white and they have their struggles but in my area it is not an uncommon mix. \n\nMy physical appearance is very ethnically ambiguous (or so I've been told). I've been mistaken for many ethnicities in my life. I speak some Chinese (still can't read or write though) but I am fluent in Spanish and I am minoring in Spanish literature. I don't know if it's for these reasons that I have always felt like it is difficult to connect with other chinese people and chinese americans that aren't my immediate family. Maybe it's all in my head and I'm not actually being judged on how I look but I've attended mixers for east asian and chinese students at my university and have been mostly ignored. it could just be that i encountered some particularly cliquish people that one time and i'm willing to try again in the future. i always just get this feeling that i'm invading the safe space of people who grew up in similar ways and have similar life experiences. \n\nI feel very far removed from other people my age who are asian american and I don't know how to get in touch with that side of my identity. I engage in Chinese culture pretty regularly. I play mahjong, I can cook Chinese food, and I'm fond of many Chinese film directors. These are things I engage in with my family and I would like to connect more with my peers/broader community. Has anyone else experienced something like this? Are there any other nonwhite biracial people out there who feel the same way?",

In their minds, they were gonna lead privileged lives once they became men, but when they transitioned, they were like rabbits caught in headlights as reality hit them like a train. Real life was a 180 degree difference.\n\nThese people have been treated like women their entire lives, and had been led to believe the game was fully rigged against women.\n\nImagine you're playing a game against bots, but you don't realize it and think you're good at the game.

    "text": "Male privilege is a myth in Muslim countries, too, and here's why: **Afghanistan**\n\n*Trafficking*\n\nWell here's an interesting fact: [boys are more likely in Afghanistan to be trafficked than girls](https://hagarinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hagar-Research-Forgotten-No-More-Male-Child-Trafficking-in-Afghanistan.pdf). They can be subjected to sexual trafficking, forced labor or being sent off as a soldier (a loophole due to the country's absence of conscription). For example, boys often age 13 and under often were sexually trafficked into Bacha Bazi or \"boy play\", which was a custom where young boys were forced into entertainment where they danced or sang sexually as male entertainers for adult men and were raped repeatedly by their captors and his friends. At least 50 percent of sexual exploitation in Afghanistan was bacha bazi, and it often crossed lines into forced labor. Boys age 13 and under were most likely to be sexually exploited, and because Afghan girls were banned from sexual work and entertainment because they were seen as child-bearers and homemakers, [Afghan boys were picked as a substitute for sexual gratification](https://76crimes.com/2021/10/21/sex-trafficking-of-boys-contributed-to-taliban-victory-in-afghanistan/), being seen as a substitute for women. As a result, the people raping them saw them as a fake woman and didn't consider themselves gay for raping them. Taliban opposed Bacha Bazi but American-backed Afghan leaders practiced it and American forces ignored it. This led to support towards Taliban from families of victims and others opposed to the practice. The boys were made to dress in feminine attire and were released as soon as they grew beards. Many powerful Afghan men supported the practice because they believed women are for children and boys are for sexual gratification.\n\nBoys are more likely to be trafficked in Afghanistan than girls, as mentioned above, and often forced into forced labor or being a soldier, with young men ages 14 to 18 often being forced as soldiers or forced labor. Many soldiers were forced to become suicide bombers and young men put in forced labor worked in mines, worked in the streets or assistant truck driving.\n\n*Crime victimization and abuse*\n\n[Physical abuse and corporal punishment is common for Afghan kids](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220614&type=printable). Except for baseline, boys were more likely than girls to experience physical punishment at home. Boys were also more likely than girls to experience peer violence victimization. Boys also scored higher than girls on depression, but often admittedly scored slightly higher on hope. Schools and teachers also inflicted corporal punishment and violence, particularly on boys. 100% of boy schools and only 20% of girl schools involved physical punishment from teachers. The same study found high rates of sexual abuse, including rape, of boys at schools, often by male teachers and older boys. When it comes to physical abuse, mothers often can be aggressors. In a [study](https://www.whatworks.co.za/documents/publications/424-ndungu-et-al-gibbs-2021-afghan-child-punishment-sem-15122021/file), 71.8% of married women admitted to physically abusing their children, and a little less than half said their partner also did so, which means many times, their partner, presumably a husband, did not do so. [In a study of physical abuse of children in Afghanistan](https://areu.org.af/wp-content/areu_publications/2016/01/804E-Love-Fear-and-Discipline-IP-print.pdf.pdf), men were more likely to believe boys got more physically disciplined, possibly due to probably experiencing it themselves or due to boys being perceived as potentially troublemakers. Women believed girls were beaten more, and women reported higher levels of violence directed towards girls because men might be unaware of violence mothers inflict on girls in the house.\n\n*Murder/homicide*\n\nIn Afghanistan, [87% of homicide victims are men](http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/data/GSH2013_Sex_data.xlsx). [In fact](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/9/10/it-is-time-we-remember-afghan-men-are-also-victims-of-this-war), Afghan men and boys were killed all the time and American media only focused on the women and children, portraying Afghan men as sexist oppressors, but these men are usually victims instead. Due to media portraying Afghan men as evil misogynistic terrorists, the American military killed many male Afghan civilians and assumed they were terrorists. The media used feminist language (even the right-wing media did this) to portray women there as damsels in distress in need to help but not due to care for the women there, but to influence Americans into supporting the war against Afghanistan. America's war created so many political and economic issues, it made Afghanistan even more dangerous and violent for women and even for men. In fact, the US military only helped solely women who claimed to be harmed by Taliban, so many women lied and said the Taliban hurt them to get US aid from the US military. Most American soldiers, just like their political leaders or generals, did not distinguish between Afghan male civilians and Taliban fighters, and thus killed many male civilians. They often were unlawfully imprisoned, tortured and killed by the US military despite being civilians. Often mistaken as security threats instead of civilians, these men were killed either by the US military or by Taliban. According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, between January 2004 and February 2020, the US conducted at least 13,072 drone attacks in Afghanistan, killing 4126 to 10,076 people. 300 to 909 of those killed are believed to have been civilians. It's impossible to know how many were really civilians, because the US did everything to obscure this number. As the New York Times [explained](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html) in 2012, for example, the Obama administration counted “all military-age males \\[killed\\] in a strike zone as combatants … unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent.” “Counterterrorism officials,” the Times article went on to say, “insist this approach is one of simple logic: people in an area of known terrorist activity, or found with a top Qaeda operative, are probably up to no good.” Thus, many Afghan men who were civilians were killed by being guilty by association. They lived in Afghanistan in areas the US attacked, being labeled as automatically terrorists by default.\n\n[In fact](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/07/1096382), the media emphasizes women and children in Afghanistan who are wounded or killed, when adult men are the most likely to have been killed. In Afghanistan, of all civilian casualties, 32% were women and 14% were children. This means 54% were men. Men were the most likely to be casualties, more so than women and more so than children. Not to mention some these children are presumably boys. The media emphasizes exclusively the women and children who are killed.\n\n*Taliban's treatment of boys*\n\n[Taliban have turned so many young boys into soldiers](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/09/20/our-opportunity-end-talibans-use-child-soldiers). Boys as young as 6 are indoctrinated, and by age 13, learned how to use firearms. By their teenage years they were required to fight. The US-backed Afghan government and pro-government forces also recruited and used young boys. Taliban also used these boys to carry out suicides and other violent attacks, recruiting them through deception, promises of money or other incentives, or even threats. Taliban and other armed forces used young boys many times to carry out suicide bombings because they thought they could manipulate them more easily and might be less suspicious than adults. The US-backed former Afghan government and other pro-government forces also recruited young boys as recruitment and using them to fight. [Taliban used many young boys even as young as age 7 as suicide bombers](https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/08/31/afghanistan-taliban-should-stop-using-children-suicide-bombers), telling them lies like they would survive the bombing themselves if they were an amulet with Quran verses on it. Boys as young as 11 were also recruited by Taliban to carry out activities like smuggling weapons across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, planting explosive devices, and armed combat. There were even 5 year olds used to plant bombs in south Afghanistan.\n\nAnother thing people must realize about Afghanistan is that women didn't lack rights in Afghanistan before Taliban took over. Look up pre-Taliban Afghanistan and women didn't need to wear veils and they were much more liberated and dressed in Western clothes and often had prestigious jobs. It was like America. Honestly if the CIA didn't give weapons to Islamic fundamentalist warriors in Afghanistan during the Afghan-Soviet War in the 80s, Taliban would've never taken over. That's how osama bin laden got his weapons. The CIA gave the mujahideen guerillas weapons which helped them fight off Soviets and they saved Afghanistan but these guerillas turned Afghanistan into another war zone. Then, the Taliban told Afghans that they would stop the war zones and offered an alternative, which many Afghans thought would liberate and save Afghanistan. They then recruited many people deceptively to increase the number of Taliban members, and this helped Taliban take over. A year after taking over, Taliban then began to become oppressive, which citizens didn't expect. If it wasn't for the CIA, the mujahideen wouldn't have taken over and thus Taliban wouldn't have been able to offer an alternative to citizens and take over. The CIA indirectly created Taliban. The CIA also are why Osama bin Laden managed to get weapons.\n\n**Iran**\n\nIran didn't make women dress a certain way or do anything particularly oppressive until 1979 when the Islamic Revolution happened. Before that, Iran was a secular monarchy and it wasn't different from the Western world. Women back then had more rights than women today in Iran. If it wasn't for the 1953 CIA assassination of their prime minister, King Shah wouldn't have had such a firm rule over Iran, which eventually led to Iranians having a fit about him and overthrowing him, creating modern Iran. The CIA's actions eventually led to modern Iran happening. But men in Iran have it just as bad as women in Iran. [This article](https://avoiceformen.com/featured/the-myth-of-patriarchal-oppression-in-iran/) should give a lot of information so read this article too. Boys in Iran are disproportionately raped or homeless, men are drafted, 81.9% of murder victims are men (see citation above for Afghan murder victims too which is where I got this from), and men are economically oppressed too. The media only shows what women go through. There's much more details about men's oppression in Iran. They aren't a patriarchy. They oppress everyone, just like America. For example, yes, men can divorce women for any reason while women can only divorce men for certain reasons, but women receive more benefits: \"Should a woman get divorced, in addition to what she gets out of her husband (called *Mehrieh*), her provider is considered to be her father and in case her father is dead, she will get from the government an equal share of her father’s occupational insurance as her salary for as long as she lives. This way, most divorced women do not have to work.\" Hell, mahr is something men have to pay to women in Iran if he divorces her and it's alimony but on steroids. Look up about it. Here's [two](https://avoiceformen.com/featured/indentured-servitude-for-men-in-iran-the-myth-of-patriarchal-oppressive-divorce-alimony/) [articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahr).\n\n**Syria and Iraq (ISIS)**\n\nThe media always talks about how ISIS oppress women, but they hurt men all the time. If you look at Syria, so many men are killed, including by ISIS.\n\n*Murder*\n\n[Since March 2011, when the Syrian civil war began all the way up to now, 228,647 Syrian civilians have been killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Syrian_civil_war#Civilian_deaths). 79.4% of them were men (181,540 men), 6.96% were women (15,925 women), and 13% were children (29,741 children). Many of these children probably are boys. This means women were the least likely to be killed and usually men are killed. In fact, of all the 5,043 civilians ISIS killed, 68.65% were men, 11.64% were women, and 19% were children. Of the 200,367 civilians killed by Syrian government forces, 82.24% were men, 11.45% were children, and 5.96% were women. This means it's typically men being killed there. [Within their first year following the 2014 declaration of Caliphate](https://www.ibtimes.co.in/isis-has-beheaded-stoned-shot-1362-civilians-including-9-children-report-630716), ISIS had already killed 1,362 civilians, including 9 children and 19 women. This means 97.94% were men.\n\n*Sexual assault*\n\n[Many times the media shows women being made as sexual slaves by ISIS. What they don't show is that many men face sexual abuse/rape in this region too](https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/latest/2017/12/5a27a4e04/male-rape-sexual-torture-widespread-syria-crisis-report.html). They often were held as prisoners and raped, gang raped, or sexually tortured with these men ranging from age 10 to age 80. They also might get jobs due to poverty while being sexually blackmailed or forced to do sexual favors in countries of asylum to be paid money. In asylum countries, boys might be molested by older youth and others. [This sexual abuse of men and boys is done by ISIS, other non-state armed groups, or even the Syrian government](https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/07/29/they-treated-us-monstrous-ways/sexual-violence-against-men-boys-and-transgender). LGBT men were particularly at risk, but it happened to men regardless of sexuality, including straight, cisgender men. A woman for The Guardian, a newspaper who are pro-feminist, [even said](https://www.theguardian.com/working-in-development/2017/nov/21/male-sexual-torture-in-the-syrian-war-it-is-everywhere) she initially thought this was rare but interview many refugees from that region and all of them, including all the women, told her that they knew many men who were raped or sexually tortured, and of all men detained in prisons, the female refugees estimated 30 to 40% of the detained men were sexually abused. Armed groups even conducted raids on homes and raped both men and women. When fleeing, boys were promised food or money by older boys but were instead molested. [Syrian men are just as often sexually assaulted or tortured as Syrian women](https://www.arabnews.com/node/1370701/middle-east). People think that in these countries, society hates women who get raped, but they don't. The social norms by a vocal minority who influence/form the government decide what is right and because these countries are often dictatorships/kingdoms, most people can't say what they truly think. People might pretend to view rape victims negatively, which is why being raped damages your reputation there, but people there actually don't feel this way towards rape victims. People hate rapists there, and Syrian families were horrified by the male and female rape victims in their family's stories of sexual assault victimization. Yeah, there are honor killings, but most murder victims there are men, and honor killings don't happen as much as the media says, and a considerable chunk of it happens in a couple specific countries.\n\n**Yemen**\n\n[Even in Yemen, men and boys are often sexually abused, raped or sexually tortured in detention centers](https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/countries/yemen/). [In 2020, about 62% of civilian casualties killed were men, but this article emphasizes women and children](https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/average-six-women-killed-every-week-yemen-result-ongoing-conflict). [Even in Yemen, men and boys are raped during conflict, and this is a problem that happens in conflicts worldwide, including in any other nation](https://web.archive.org/web/20190321220806/https://www.foxnews.com/world/male-rape-emerging-as-one-of-the-most-underreported-weapons-of-todays-wars). This problem even happened in Libya in the 2011 revolution. Even in yemen, boys as young as age 8 are raped by often militias aligned with the Saudi Arabia and UAE-led coalition. Psychologists treating former underage soldiers forced to fight for Houthis, an Islamist armed group in Yemen, found that 50 to 60% of them were sexually abused by their superiors.\n\n**Saudi Arabia**\n\nEven Saudi Arabia has their fair share of oppression of men. [When it comes to trafficking victims](https://www.state.gov/reports/2020-trafficking-in-persons-report/saudi-arabia/), they only give shelter to female domestic workers and nobody else. Only Riyadh had a place for male domestic workers. Men and women from other employment sectors were unprotected. People like to complain about how women are not allowed to walk out or go on an airplane without a male guardian (at least in the nighttime) but [young men weren't allowed in malls unless with a female relative in Saudi Arabia](http://www.alriyadh.com/1008285). [In fact, evidence shows that women in Saudi Arabia are more likely than men to be happy](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2020-12/spotlight.ksa_views_on_happiness.pdf). Saudi Arabia is more happy than most countries. People there might think people in the Western world treat women poorly, and that not allowing women to do certain things is protecting them. It's called benevolent sexism rather than misogyny (or hostile sexism). The way America views Saudi Arabia is how they view America, but the people there don't necessarily agree with the government laws. [In Saudi Arabia, virtually everyone who is executed is male](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-60722057), and there's many kinds of capital crimes there, and two-thirds of homicide victims are men (citation above). [In 2013](https://ncfm.org/2013/08/news/discrimination-news/discrimination-against-men-news/saudi-arabia-bans-domestic-abuse-because-it-hadnt-already/), Saudi Arabia banned domestic violence by men against women, but ONLY men committing domestic abuse against women. Women doing this to men wasn't even banned (although maybe they'll be charged with simply assault). So much for patriarchy. [In fact, in 2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20131109094735/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/02/saudi-protest-driving-ban-not-popular), most Saudi Arabian women opposed the right to drive and they believed it would lead to sexual harassment, men betraying them, and other problems. They believed it was horrible America would allow women to drive and thought it led to women being harmed or unsafe from predators, and believed this was an imitation of America. They instead believe America allowing women to drive is oppression. They believing being prohibited from driving was a privilege. In fact, this is similar to how long ago, many women often didn't want the right to vote because they believe suffrage was harmful to women by allowing them into the dangerous world of politics and considered the lack of right to vote a privilege or luckiness. [In fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_suffrage#Dates_by_country), Afghanistan didn't allow anyone to vote until 2004 where everyone including women could vote. Although women couldn't vote in Saudi Arabia until 2015, men couldn't until 2005, just ten years prior. Men are expected to pay full sum for the wedding even if his future wife makes more than him. Men are required to work as usual with no other option, but women can get the option to work and go to school (if given permission) or they can choose to be homemaker. While women can walk alone in the daytime, at night they are required to have a man with them, but this is an overprotective attitude about women, not misogyny (hate towards women). Society just doesn't care about men getting hurt.\n\n**Domestic violence**\n\n[There's surprisingly high rates of domestic abuse against men in the Arab countries, where way more men than women are victims of DV](https://www.arabbarometer.org/wp-content/uploads/Sexual-Harassement-Domestic-Violence-Arab-Citizens-Public-Opinion-2019.pdf). There are more male victims than female victims of domestic violence in Yemen (70% vs 19%) Libya (66% vs 17%) Tunisia (52% vs 32%) Palestine (51% vs 18%) Iraq (49% vs 17%) Jordan (48% vs 11%) Sudan (41% vs 25%) Algeria (34% vs 16%). There are more female victims of domestic violence than male victims in Morocco (35% vs 29%) Egypt (43% vs 26%) and Lebanon (56 vs 18%). Typically people there get help by contacting relatives instead of police for dealing with domestic abuse. They don't often contact police unless they're in Lebanon. Yes, women come forward in Arab countries. They contact the family, and the family intervenes. It's not like in the West where you call police.\n\n**Americans underestimate people's support for women's rights in these countries**\n\nPeople in these countries aren't as conservative as their governments might be. [Among men in Egypt](https://web.archive.org/web/20170503224119/http://imagesmena.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/04/IMAGESMENA-2017-FULL-Final.pdf), men can have conservative attitudes towards women but even men. These Egyptian men still had conservative attitudes about men, most believed men and women both should not have friends of opposite gender, and most of them (80%) believed that boys are responsibile for the behavior of their sisters, even if they're younger than their sister. This means they believe the boy should be held responsible for something the sister did. Many views in the data do show you that Egyptian men have conservative attitudes towards women, but people who have conservative attitudes about what women should do or their jobs don't feel this way due to hatred of women, but due to social norms/gender roles which they still believe about men, too. 94% believe men who fail to pay maintenence should be penalized. Women were far more likely to spank (79% of women and 41% of men) or hit their children (44% of women and 11% of men). Some of the men admitted to having slapped or pushed their wife before and some women experienced it but most did not experience in the past year. Relatively low percentages outright beat them, and even lower percentages did so in the past year. Hardly any threatened them with a weapon. 64% of Egyptian men and 60% of Egyptian women believed woman should marry her rapist (but it could be out of concern for her reputation), but 72% of men and 67% of women disagreed with the idea that rapists should not be prosecuted if he rapes a woman then marries her. Only just 16% of men believed a woman is obliged to have sex whenever the husband wants if he provides financially, compared to 33% of women thinking this. Nonetheless, 80% of men and 73% of women believe a woman should be able to refuse to have sex with her husband when she doesn't want to. **Remember this though, read Arab surveys with a grain of salt. As a guy who knows many Arab immigrants, many people in these countries might have a social desirability bias and will answer what they feel the government expects them to say or what the Western questionnaires expect them to say. They probably don't mean a lot of the things they say.**\n\n  \nAccording to [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/103441/saudi-arabia-majorities-support-womens-rights.aspx) in 2007 (and the results could be different these days), 67% of Saudi men believed men and women should have equal rights, 55% believed they should be able to drive, 75% believed women should be allowed to have any job they are qualified for outside home, 52% believed women should have leadership positions in the cabinet and national council, 83% said women should keep all earnings from jobs for themselves and that husbands should support them and the household in full, and 88% believe in divorce, the child's financial support should be full responsibility of the father even if the mom has custody. Iranians had similar attitudes too, and most Iranians supported women's right to drive, including most Iranian men.\n\n**Dress codes**\n\nPeople complain about how women are required to wear a veil, but this is only true in Saudi Arabia, Iran, and some of Afghanistan. It wasn't always true in these countries. Besides, in many countries they aren't required to wear anything and in any other country besides these 3 they aren't required to wear a veil but it is widespread. but only Saudi Arabia requires BURQAS. In Iran you still them wear normal clothes, just a mere hijab and they still show some of their hair. But men have a dress code too. [In Iran](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2013/11/07/IRN102671.E.pdf), men can't wear shorts or western hairstyles, and men who wear \"feminine\" clothes might get stripped or beaten. [Men have to cover knees, and cannot wear sleeveless shirts without stigmatization](https://www.bordersofadventure.com/iran-dress-code-what-to-wear/). [In Saudi Arabia](https://www.saudiarabiavisa.co.uk/dress-code-foreigners.html), men aren't required to wear thobes as tourists but must cover legs and shoulders. They must avoid skinny jeans, shorts or sleeveless shirts. [In fact](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/20/themalehijab), in Iran, up until maybe the 2000s, men were required to wear long-sleeved shirts before they could wear short-sleeved. [In Iraq](https://web.archive.org/web/20150529185836/https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/18/world/middleeast/a-haircut-in-iraq-can-be-the-death-of-the-barber.html), for example, barbers were killed by militias for giving \"un-Islamic\" haircuts or shaving beards. These Islamic militants tried to stop beardless men in Iraq. One Iraqi fled and said he was beaten up as onlookers cheered for lacking enough facial hair and wearing traditional clothes instead of a t-shirt and jeans or bright clothes or clothes with English writings. [Taliban](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2022-03-28/taliban-bars-government-employees-without-beards-from-work-sources) also set restrictions on men saying they will be fired from government unless they have beards and wear certain clothes. [Taliban even will severely punish any man without a beard and stop male drivers to check if he has a beard or not](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/rest-of-the-world-news/afghanistan-taliban-carries-out-vehicle-checks-to-see-mens-beards-womens-clothing-articleshow.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt's a myth that male privilege happens in Muslim countries. Men and women are both oppressed there and the media just focuses on when women are but ignores men's problems there. In fact, [the roots of sexism toward women in the Arab World go back to Ottoman empire problems, which is caused by western europe](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/the-real-roots-of-sexism-in-the-middle-east-its-not-islam-race-or-hate/256362/). It wasn't caused by Islam. These countries weren't even always like this and pre-Islamic Arabia was actually worse for women until Prophet Muhammad came. It wasn't until the past couple centuries (and couple decades in some countries) when it all changed. Dress codes in these countries used to be more diverse and vary until recent times.",

    "text": "Many studies show black men face more discrimination than black women. Here is the evidence: Intersectional feminists often argue that black women have it the worst, and they suffer worse than black men because they're black and a woman. Well guess what? There's lots of evidence that shows black men face more discrimination than black women.\n\nThis [article](https://theconversation.com/black-men-face-high-discrimination-and-depression-even-as-their-education-and-incomes-rise-141027) by *The Conversation* elaborates on what black men deal with. According to study 1, black boys from the wealthiest families were the most depressed. Study 2 found that for black men, the highest education credentials were associated with an increase, not decrease, in depressive symptoms. Study 3 found that in a nationally representative sample of American adults, black men with the highest income had the highest risk of depression, specifically major depressive disorder. Interpersonal or one-on-one discrimination was not found to be a factor. Study 4 found that 700 black teenagers were followed for two decades in Flint, Michigan. Perceived racial discrimination was measured in 1999 and 2002. Discrimination as teens was a predictor of depressive symptoms in people transitioned to young adulthood a decade later. Nonetheless, this was only true for black men, but not black women. In that same study in Flint, an increase in perceived neighborhood fear, defined as being scared of the crime and violence in the neighborhood, was linked with an increase in depressive symptoms for black men, but not black women. Study 6 found on IAT tests that white men had higher racist attitudes towards black people than white women, but the difference wasn't particularly extreme, but statistically significant. Nonetheless, white women also can be really racist towards black people, too.\n\nBlack men also get arrested, incarcerated and stopped or profiled far more than black women. Even white men experience being arrested and incarcerated far more than black women. And the reason why most prisoners are men isn't simply because men commit crime more. [A significant minority of criminals are women](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/xyl5wb/statistics_cited_women_are_more_likely_to_commit/), but female criminals are severely underreported, get arrested less when reported, are less likely to be incarcerated when convicted, are paroled earlier, and given more lenient sentences compared to men. Additionally, black men are far more likely than anyone else to be killed by police. [In fact](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-06/race-and-police-shootings-what-new-research-says), white and Asian men were much more likely than even black or Native American women to be killed by police. Almost all police homicide victims were men! [Black men were also much more likely than anyone, even black women, to be murdered in general](https://www.niussp.org/health-and-mortality/americas-high-homicide-rate/?print=print). [Black men are also more likely than black women to be victims of crime in general](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/bvvc.pdf). [Black men also were](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/05/02/for-black-americans-experiences-of-racial-discrimination-vary-by-education-level-gender/) more likely to be subject to racial slurs/jokes, be unfairly stopped by a police officer, have people act suspicious towards them, been assumed to be prejudiced, or to have feared for their personal safety. In fact, 59% of black men had been unfairly stopped by police, compared to just 31% of black women.\n\nAnother study called \"[Gender Matters Too](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2008-05171-002)\" found black men and women in 11th grade classrooms differed in their perception of peer and classroom discrimination. For boys, discrimination harmed their grades, attitudes and their regard for the importance of school. For girls, however, the effects generally had a positive impact. Another [study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspa0000288) found that the real root of racism towards blacks was perceived threat, not dislike, and that people were racist toward black people not due to negativity towards them but feeling threatened by them, especially black men. When isolating negativity from threat, they found no automatic black-negativity link. Negativity towards blacks was associated with viewing them as a threat. [In fact](https://polisci.osu.edu/sites/polisci.osu.edu/files/mcconnaughy_white.pdf), another study found that people viewed black men as particularly violent, and viewed white men as more violent than black women. They ascribed a low amount of violent personalities to black women and an especially low amount of it to white women. They viewed black men as more promiscuous than white men, white men as more promiscuous than black women, white women slightly more promiscuous than black women! They viewed black men as less intelligent than black women, and viewed black men as less ambitious than black women. Fast responders gave unpleasant responses to black men far more than to black women. All responders gave black men the most unpleasant responses compared to black women and white men and women, and black women slightly less unpleasant responses compared to both white men and white women! Another [study](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.848.1523&rep=rep1&type=pdf) found that even both male and female participants were equally likely as each other to be more willing to shoot a black unarmed suspect than a white female armed suspect or black female armed suspect. Men and women equally were likely (when not even looking at race) to prefer shooting unarmed male suspects over armed female suspects. An implicit racial bias [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/0146167219829182) found that black women were seen as more dangerous than white women by participants of all races, but they still viewed black men as more dangerous than black women. Even when looking at black children, they viewed black boys as more dangerous than black girls.\n\n**Black men had it worse during slavery**\n\nThis thread I made a year ago talks about how there were more male than female black people enslaved in the United States, and the black women were more likely to be free. In 19th century United States, [more men than women were slaves and more women than men were freed slaves](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1010277/black-and-slave-population-us-by-gender/). Although there was always a difference, the difference increased in the Civil War because of all the black male soldiers who died, and women weren't sent off to war as soldiers.\n\nThis only looks at the ones in the US. Believe it or not, the vast majority of enslaved black people were sent to places like South America or the Caribbeans, and a minuscule percentage were in the US. [When looking at all the enslaved black people from the 17th to 19th century](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1183869/ratio-male-female-slaves-by-route-1636-1867/), they found that in any region, men outnumbered women, with the gap being quite large in most regions. Many historians think all slave owners were white men, but evidence found that 40% were white women. They were often cruel and violent just like male slave owners. In fact, George Washington's wife owned way more enslaved people than him. White women were trained to enslave black people from a very young age, and they even were often given slaves as early as 9 months old! [According to](https://www.history.com/news/white-women-slaveowners-they-were-her-property) History.com:\n\n>White women were active and violent participants in the slave market. They bought, sold, managed and sought the return of enslaved people, in whom they had a vested economic interest. Owning a large number of enslaved people made a woman a better marriage prospect. Once married, white women fought in courts to preserve their legal ownership over enslaved people (as opposed to their husband’s ownership), and often won. “For them, slavery was their freedom,” Jones-Rogers observes in her book.\n\n**Black men were raped, too.**\n\nWe often hear about female slaves being raped, and how it was legal to rape black women. [What we don't hear about is how often black men were raped by slave owners](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/448992/pdf). [They often were](https://shareok.org/handle/11244.46/1279). They also were stripped naked and white people laughed at their genitals (i.e.: body shaming of men for their penis size even though they have no control or choice of their penis size). According to the [AAIHS](https://www.aaihs.org/sexual-violence-against-enslaved-men/),\n\n>Foster begins *Rethinking Rufus* by examining how enslaved men’s bodies were depicted in Western art and sculptures that were widespread in the visual culture of slavery. Foster argues that enslaved men’s bodies were “symbols of enslaved manhood and sites of violation” that were objectified through a number of cultural forms including art and literature (12). The objectification of enslaved men depicted in paintings often resembled everyday acts of terror including the public inspection of Black men’s genitals, whippings and lashings, and bodily exposure due to lack of adequate clothing. Visual depictions of enslaved men that emphasized their genitalia and sexual prowess gave way to the prevailing myths of Black hypersexuality and the Black male rapist, an archetype that ensured the extralegal protection of white women from Black men who purportedly lacked control over their sexual urges. Foster also argues that while visual depictions of enslaved men’s bodies often highlighted their athleticism, strength, and muscularity, this same imagery eroticized enslaved men’s bodies in ways that fueled the physical abuses and sexual exploitation of enslaved men. Foster notes that these stereotypes found in eighteenth-century visual art contributed to the eventual punishment and national disenfranchisement of Black men.\n\n**White women also raped or sexually preyed on black men, too.**\n\n[White women also had sexually abused black men, too](http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1674/sexual-relations-between-elite-white-women-and-enslaved-men-in-the-antebellum-south-a-socio-historical-analysis). White women were authority figures or in a position of power over these black men, and white women had sex with black men, often even raping them forcibly. White women also threatened to falsely accuse black men of rape if black men didn't have sex with them. Because abortion was unregulated, and any woman was able to get an abortion back then, many white women used this advantage to sexually abuse black men without people knowing she fornicated out of wedlock, and was able to abortion \"illegitimate\" children, hiding the evidence that she sexually abused black men. As a result of this and the fact that men could not speak about being raped because people believe men cannot be raped, historical records of white women raping black men are often overlooked, and it could've been more common than we think, perhaps as common as white men raping enslaved black women.\n\n**Almost all lynching victims were men whereas a significant minority of victims were white.**\n\n[Another interesting fact](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5803482/lynching-nj-1901/): virtually all lynching victims were men. Of all the 2,516 lynchings that happened from 1885 to 1901 in the US, 82.67% happened in the South and 13.75% happened in the North. 66.69% were black and 31.84% were white. 97.97% were men and 2.03% were women. Just 51 women lynched compared to 2,465 men. We always hear about how most victims were black, but no information about how virtually all were men. White men got lynched far more than black women. Black women rarely were lynched, and almost no white women got lynched.\n\n**Black people also face discrimination when it comes to rape.**\n\nIt is true that people are less responsive to black women who got raped than white female rape victims, but if people knew how common it was for men to be raped, and women rape men as just as much as men rape women (cited in a thread I cited above about women being more likely to commit crime than people think), then I'm sure they'd respond less to black male rape victims than white male or black female rape victims. In fact, they'd probably care for black women who are raped than white men who raped. Black men also are viewed as hypersexual, promiscuous, unable to control sexual urges, and always wanting sexual intercourse.\n\nAlso, false accusations happen a lot more than feminists admit, and I cite evidence for it in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/xzb7d8/statistics_show_that_false_accusations_are_quite/) of mine, and black men especially are affected. Black prisoners incarcerated for rape are especially likely to be innocent, especially when their accuser is a white woman. White women historically falsely accused black men of rape to get them lynched, and they still falsely accuse them, and while most rapists get away with it, black men who are accused by white women are more likely to be incarcerated even if they're innocent. It was considered rape historically for black men to have consensual sexual intercourse with white women, and there was a double standard for a while where people judged black men marrying white women more harshly than white men marrying black women because black men were viewed as predatory.\n\n**Education/life expectancy**\n\nBlack women also have a higher life expectancy than white men and especially black men, and are less likely to go to college than white men but [go more than black men](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/black-women-are-earning-more-college-degrees-but-that-alone-wont-close-race-gaps/).\n\n**Feminists don't care about black people, not even black women.**\n\nFeminists often don't pay attention much to black women's struggles. Even first wave feminists disregarded them and didn't want them to vote, let alone allow black men to vote, and that motivated them and was a reason why they wanted to vote, because they worried black men were technically allowed to vote despite Jim Crow laws and didn't want them to have the complete ability to vote before white women.\n\nNonetheless, many stereotypes feminists make about men are especially applied to black men due to society historically portraying them as hypermasculine, hypersexual and prone to violence or crime. Feminists' portrayal of men harms black men especially. They also ignore false rape accusations despite that white women still, to this day, falsely accuse black men of rape which is why so many black prisoners are falsely incarcerated for rape, and yet feminists expect every reported person for rape to be imprisoned. They also widely ignore how black women are associated more with the term black than with women, and aren't viewed as normal women.\n\nThis is why womanism (black feminism) was started.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDoes anyone notice how people hate black men more than black women? Yeah black women face pregnancy discrimination with prenatal care and dealing with more abortions and unwanted pregnancies, but black men usually don't ever get to see their kids, and often cannot afford to pay child support. Many black children are raised by single moms and barely knew their dad, if at all.\n\nThe reason black men face more discrimination than black women is due to people's racism towards black people being associated with seeing them as a threat, not dislike, and being a woman prevents black women from being seen as a threat as much as black men. Nonetheless, people might see black women as more dangerous than white women and be racist towards them due to a guilt by association mindset. In spite of that, people still are more racist towards black men because when racial attitudes are mostly about feeling threatened, people tend to view women in general as harmless, which is different from how they view men in general.",

    "text": "Women did make lots of contributions to society, and it is feminists, not men, who erased that from historical records. In fact, people have always thought women before their period were oppressed. A feminist from the 1940s named Mary Beard wrote a book called *Woman as a Force in History*. It critiques the myth that women were historically treated as subordinate to men and they were restricted from contributing to society or having basic human rights. Her book only includes just a portion of what women contributed to in society, and she says there's so much more. She has no idea how it got erased from history, but critiques the idea that women were historically oppressed compared to men.\n\n**Women did have an education in medieval times.**\n\nFeminists like to think that women were denied an education historically because people hated them and wanted them to suffer, but that's false. In fact, in medieval times, women were being educated all the time, and were as literate as men. G. G. Coulton, the life-long student of mediaeval history, gives a cautious answer: “Though very few women arrived at anything like the university stage in education, it seems probable that more of them could read and write than the men,” especially in the upper classes “at the period when romances of adventure were offered in profusion.” Interestingly, going to university was less common back then.\n\nThis [chapter](https://www.marxists.org/archive/beard/woman-force/ch11.htm) from her book elaborates on all the education women had back long ago in medieval Europe. It was very normal for them to have an education. Italian and German women especially had the most education of the Middle Ages. You can see that women had education and high literacy rates, and were more literate than men. They succeeded a lot in education. Maybe there were some societies that normalized education for boys, but that's because in those societies, education taught discipline, not facts, and people believed girls were more well-behaved than boys and thus didn't need it. Moreover, corporal punishment was used on boys much more, and boys were subjected to forced labor. This was meant for build character and discipline in children. Women weren't educated because it was believed they were less prone to bad behavior and didn't need to be educated. There was only a small overlap between education becoming useful for learning things, and women not being allowed to be educated. Later on, corporal punishment and forced labor declined in schools. It was actually seen as unmanly for boys to be willing to learn.\n\nEven in the later 19th century, girls performed better than boys in elementary schools and outnumbered them, and even in the early 1900s, when high school became more common, girls went to high school more often. Girls even had free education whereas boys in high school had to have their parents pay a fee. You can read more about this from the book *The Privileged Sex*.\n\n**Women did build society and contribute to the social and economic realm of society.**\n\nIn [Chapter 10](https://www.marxists.org/archive/beard/woman-force/ch10.htm), Beard wrote:\n\n>AFTER the dissolution of the Roman Empire, nearly all the economic activities connected with the production of food, clothing, and shelter were carried on in rural villages and their outlying fields everywhere in Western Europe. Whether the village was a free community or property belonging to the estate of a great feudal lord or lady, it was largely self-sufficing; its inhabitants supplied nearly all their needs for the maintenance of life. Furthermore, the industries of households and fields were not like the modern “heavy industries.” Women could handle nearly all of them alone or with some aid from men.  \n>  \n>Thus there was no sharp division of labor as a rule. Men and women worked together for the most part. If the major responsibilities for spinning, weaving, and cooking were women’s tasks, if wood-cutting and ditching were generally men’s tasks, men and women commonly worked side by side in the fields and to a considerable extent in all the processes of transforming raw materials into commodities for use. Whether the toilers on the land were bond or free, men and women labored under similar conditions and enjoyed similar liberties of choice such as they were. Though women gave birth to the children, both parents had the services of children to help them in their work. In the records of mediaeval rural life that are available in our age, no specially onerous burdens are found to have been laid on women as women by men as men. On the contrary the records show a sharing of the toilsome tasks on about the same terms.\n\nWomen were also, even in the Indian and Middle Eastern regions, just as involved in gilds as men. Beard writes:\n\n>While in some of the records the details are lacking, Smith’s *English* Gilds contains accounts of the structure, membership, functions, and proceedings of about eighty-five gilds. In at least seventy-two of them women were members on an equal basis with men. That is surely a large proportion. In some of the other gilds a slight qualification was placed on widows; they were accepted if their husbands had been gild men. Lest the idea of sheer generosity or friendship for the deceased be adjudged the reason for admitting widows to gilds, let it be remembered that, in innumerable cases, widows carried on the craft in which their husbands had been active, being directly familiar with it as a household industry at which they had themselves labored or in connection with which they had borne responsibilities for training and directing apprentices.\n\nWomen were not in a segregated gild, and mixed gilds were common. Some men didn't approve of women in some gilds, but it wasn't due to hatred of women, but because they believed women weren't strong enough for things like bread-kneading and bread-baking. Nonetheless, these men didn't get the monopoly they looked for:\n\n>But a French Parlement refused to prohibit the customary baking by women and declined to back up the men’s opposition to the women. A French parliamentary decree even accorded some gild women rights frequently denied to English widows; it ruled that a widow could retain her membership in a gild even if she took as her second husband a man who did not work in her craft.\n\nWomen also were involved in all kinds of parts of society:\n\n>Just as women took part and carried full loads of work in agriculture, domestic industries, and trading, just as they participated in the activities of craft, trade, and social gilds or corporations, so they shared and expressed themselves in all the forms of social life in town and country. In everything human their qualities and force were expressed – from religious and secular festivities, sports, games, and riots to the **discussion of religious and moral questions and the management of charitable undertakings**. In castles and cottages, in fields and in gild halls, on village greens and in churchyards, in towns and on city streets, in taverns and at market fairs they sought release from the rigors of earning a livelihood, from burdens of domesticity, or responsibilities belonging to the status of their class, whatever it was.\n\nWhen knights even had tournaments to display prowess, it was often done to impress female spectators. **Women's cheers brought outlets in arguments over public, private or religious matters, and in disputes about property, trade, marriage arrangements, family problems, tastes, habits and good or bad manners**. In fact, in medieval times, women were very fierce in many cases, and they would steal husbands' money and run with monks, get in violent fights with women in arguments, smash knights with swords, drinking and singing in taverns, etc. One woman even bloodied a priest's nose after he tried to rape her. When the priest ordered to her to become a pilgrim to Rome, Thomas of Cantimpre laughed and advised to the woman that if a priest sexually assaults or inappropriately pursues her:\n\n>then thou smite him sore with thy clenched fist, even to the striking out, if possible, of his eye; and in this matter thou shalt spare no order of men, for it is as lawful for thee to strike in defense of thy chastity as to fight for thy life.\n\nIn medieval times, women were seen as sinful or wicked, resorting to magic, or the originators of sin, and in need to obey priests or obedient to their husbands, but men were seen as brutal or vulgar, and he had to love his wife, help her support the family and never harm her, and charivaris were done against him or even family intervention if he abused his wife. This was all a reaction to the aggression women engaged in then that people thought women would never do and that only men would do (and feminists reinforce this gender role by portraying all violent women as victims):\n\n>Also, repeated again and again and again in mediaeval documents was the idea that women had been better, if not ideal, “in the good old days,” but were now given to luxury, assertiveness, display, love of worldly goods and pleasures. Hence it would appear that the newest clichés are not so new after all.\n\nMen fought at wars more than women and committed crime more, but women who had power waged wars. Women assembled soldiers. Women fought side by side with men. Women were guilty of many cruelties, and women aided and approved the worst. Women conformed to no type, and they weren't \"tame\" in a \"man's world\". \n\n**Women had a lot of power in marriage and family that men had.**\n\nAccording to the same chapter, Beard wrote:\n\n>Beyond all question the weight of documentary evidence is against any simple conclusion that men handed women around like chattels; that boys were free to make their own choices of mates, while girls were helpless creatures at the disposition of men. After the rise of the centralized state, no one, male or female, was actually “free,” save perhaps the king or queen as highest lord, and even members of royal families had to be on guard against actions likely to stir up revolt among underlings. As a matter of fact, fathers and mothers of the middle and lower classes, as well as lords and ladies, took part in arranging the marriages of both boys and girls under the almost universal rule of “convenience.” The boy apparently had no more choice than the girl. There are records indicating that boys and girls sometimes made vigorous protests without avail; other records show that their protests were effective. But the general rule of marriage for convenience long prevailed.  \n>  \n>Whether fathers or mothers , men or women, usually dominated in the making of matches is a matter buried in the silence of unrecorded history, but there is abundant proof that women were active in the business and were no less circumspect or ruthless than men at the business. Women looked about for marriageable boys and girls to be convenient mates for girls and boys in their own families. Maidens were inclined to be shrewd and insistent – that is, “practical” – in marrying men with property, when they had any chance of selection, as they often did. Mothers were zealous in procuring for their daughters men who had property and in making sure that the property was good, and carefully guarded by proper legal titles. In other words, the marriage of convenience was no one-sided affair in which fathers and sons “had their own way” with the women concerned in it.\n\nAnd women still owned property. It's a myth they couldn't historically. They always were allowed to even back in antiquity. \n\n**Women were involved in warfare and building antiquity.**\n\n[According to chapter 12](https://www.marxists.org/archive/beard/woman-force/ch12.htm), German writer Sir Galahad described the ways of aggressive women long ago. Proof of armed women was found in European ancient ruins, proving that Amazons, the Greek female warriors, were real. Some people think early human years were peaceful, but fights broke out and disrupted it, and women were active in these conflicts in every way men were:\n\n>Where they had power as rulers or in ruling families they often instigated and proclaimed wars and even marshaled their troops as they went into battle. They incited men to ferocity at the fighting fronts. They accompanied men on marauding expeditions. They fought in the ranks. They took up arms to defend their homes. They nursed men on battle fronts or kept households going while men were at battle, and they looked after the wounded on their return to civilian life.  \n>  \n>There was not a type of war in which women did not participate. They were among the primitive hordes which went on looting expeditions against their neighbors or stood fast on their own ground in defense of their lives, herds, and fields. Old Roman records testify to the savagery of women in the Cimbrian tribes that swept down from the north into Rome. Among the Cimbrians, priestesses took charge of war captives. Standing on ladders which they carried with them to battle, they cut off the heads of prisoners, caught the blood in pots, and gave it to their men to drink, in the belief that it would double their strength.\n\nAncient women also initiated or inspired military efforts to subjugate others. Alexander the Great's militant Epirote mother, \"a priestess to whom his father, Philip, had been attracted when he saw her as a maiden prancing to or from a temple with a snake, a god symbol, held high in her arms, and attended by a procession of other maidens\", drove Alexander to become the master of the world. In most of Europe in antiquity and even during Arabia when Islam spread and people declared war against the Muslims, women fought at war. Even Muhammad had his female warriors who teamed up with him.\n\n**Women did influence politics, economics and social change historically.**\n\nFeminists argue women were forbidden from politics. Not exactly. While people were serving in the government were men in many societies, it's because they believed those who fought for our country were the ones allowed to form the government, but not all societies only sent women to war. [In fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_suffrage#Dates_by_country), in almost all countries, originally, neither men nor women could vote, and they usually granted suffrage to both concurrently. In some countries, they originally granted it men, then later women. In the US and UK, men originally could only vote if they owned property, and only 3% of British men and 6% of American men did (women were never property). In 1828 during the presidential election, the vast majority of states gave all men the right to vote, but it wasn't in all states until universal white male suffrage was given to men in North Carolina in 1856. Later on, women were given the right to vote more and more. It was simply because men served in the military in the US back then, not because women were considered inferior.\n\nNonetheless, women DID influence politics historically. Not voting didn't stop this, [and many women were originally against the right to vote](https://www.societyforhistoryeducation.org/pdfs/M15_Miller.pdf) because they worried it'd take away their soft power in influencing politics. In fact, many men supported their right to vote for equality, and while people who supported women's suffrage thought it was unfair they couldn't vote, people who opposed it worried that women had more power influencing politics than men because the government responded to women's needs more while men just cast in a vote that only wins if it's the majority opinion. Susan B. Anthony said women's suffrage laws \"probably never would have passed if it had been up to women to vote on them,\" and that men were actually more progressive about women’s suffrage than women were (1902). This [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/15ac3xy/women_did_influence_politics_before_suffrage_and/) of mine elaborates on how women influenced politics easily before voting.\n\nContrary to what feminists think, laws weren't created based strictly on the opinions of men. Only 1% of men worked for the government, and they usually made laws based on what they thought was best for the land or its people, but not for men. Totalitarian leaders might be all about themselves, but certainly not men either. Women's opinions mattered a lot to men. [In fact](https://presidentlincoln.illinois.gov/Blog/Posts/141/Abraham-Lincoln/2021/8/Lincolns-avoided-duel/blog-post/), [Abraham Lincoln](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/abraham-lincolns-duel) even used female pen names pretending to be a woman to attack political rivals, including James Shields.\n\nAlongside speaking against recent policy decisions made by Shields, Lincoln implied that his opponent was weird and unpopular with women.\n\n>*\"His very features, in the ecstatic agony of his soul, spoke audibly and distinctly – 'Dear girls, it is distressing, but I cannot marry you all. Too well I know how much you suffer; but do, do remember, it is not my fault that I am so handsome and so interesting.’”* \\-- Rebecca (Abraham Lincoln)\n\nLincoln's wife also wrote several letters against Shield under a female penname. Lincoln apparently consulted with her about his letters to make them sound like a woman wrote them. What does this mean? Women were seen as pure and moral compared to men, so their voices mattered a lot in politics, and because they couldn't vote, they were seen as fair and reasonable. **This is why women often opposed the right to vote, because they worried it would prevent them from being influential in politics.** If the 1800s were so patriarchal, why would he have used a female penname to pretend that a man was unpopular with women to destroy that man's career?\n\n[Moreover](https://daily.jstor.org/women-against-womens-suffrage/), Catharine Beecher, an advocate for women’s education and economic advancement, argued that women were most effective when they united to press their fathers, brothers, and husbands for reforms in terms that rose above intense partisan politics. Using anecdotal evidence, she pointed to her sister, Harriet Beecher Stowe, whose [*Uncle Tom’s Cabin*](https://daily.jstor.org/frederick-douglass-feud-over-uncle-toms-cabin/) had contributed to anti-slavery sentiment in the country, selling quickly before the Civil War and humanizing enslaved black people. It changed American's views of enslavement at the time, especially in the North. Another example was the women’s clubs that fought for pure food laws, [compulsory schooling](https://daily.jstor.org/why-would-parents-oppose-compulsory-education/), and other reforms that were easily framed in terms of maternal care.\n\n[Women influenced politics in many other ways, too](https://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/5-ways-women-influenced-politics-they-got-vote). In the 1800s, men and women flirted at political rallies and met their potential spouse. Politically-charged women charmed men into supporting certain political views, especially first-time male voters. In his new book *The Virgin Vote*, Smithsonian political history curator Jon Grinspan explains that women even \"turned down marriage proposals specifically because of a young man's political affiliations.\" These actions pressured husbands and suitors to vote in favor of a woman's views.\n\nCarry Nation, a female leader in the Temperance movement, used to use hatchets to smash saloons. Churches and theaters paid her to against alcohol. In the Victorian era, if a man smashed alcohols, he'd be stabbed, but men were chivalrous towards women and refused to harm her. Many people laughed at her, but respected her integrity for her beliefs anyway. Carry's radical approach helped launch the Temperance movement into mainstream American politics.\n\nEven in medieval times, women teamed up with Prophet Muhammad to fight off aggressors against Muslims and helped spread the message of Islam. Women in medieval Europe brought discussions and disputes about moral, societal, or religious issues.\n\nWhen wars happened over the centuries, wars of conquest, defense, crusades, or self-defense did not exclude women. As long as the Eastern Empire lasted, women were involved in situations that led to war. As the empire declined and feudal wars happened for imperialism, women in aristocracies and royal families inspired and initiated wars, and sometimes used their own weapons. They built the state of Western worlds which turned local conflicts into global wars, assisted by women. For centuries in the West and East, imperial power only was ostensibly (but not exactly so) bestowed to men who were head of a family. In reality, official or not, his power was shared by women. Imperial power was often exercised by one or more women. Even in Ancient Rome, the state had lots of power among its women. Beard cited:\n\n>Among such studies of ancient Rome are the 1,124 pages of the old work by J. R. de Serviez, *Roman Empresses ... Wives of the Twelve Caesars,* first published in the eighteenth century – an age of despotism in Europe; and G. Ferrero’s *Women of the Caesars,* published in 1911 when the power of European family clans was rapidly dissolving.\n\nOther wars/conflicts, like the Renaissance, the restoration of the Bourbons, War of the Spanish Succession, War of the Austrian Succession. As medieval Europe was developing, in rural families, men and women worked together almost consistently, and the woman kept the family and its land and house economy going while husbands went to war in England. In royal and aristocratic families in England, women used force in the state of affairs and in the management of the economy helping the monarchy. It wasn't until the the 18th century in England during revolutions destroying the royal/aristocratic families founded on wealth did women and their families in these groups lose power and the parliament and government became solely men. As time went by men, men were the ones serving in military, and they decided men thus would be the ones allowed in the government, but women had soft power in influencing politics as mentioned earlier, which is why people worried giving them the right to vote would get rid of that subtle power. This change happened especially in the French Revolution. In the 1800s, more and more women suffragists were appearing, but men also struggled with the right to vote beside the low minority who had property and thus qualified. In the most progressive societies, women received the right to vote before men's universal suffrage appeared in other societies. Before this point, there were women were highly involved in royal/aristocratic power over influencing politics and society. \n\n[Up until a couple centuries ago](https://www.cracked.com/article_20186_6-ridiculous-myths-about-middle-ages-everyone-believes.html), Europe was agricultural. In medieval Europe, if a father was owning a shop or tavern, his daughters were the ones helping. If her dad became unable to, she sometimes took over the business herself if he was now unable to, which didn't really happen until later in modern times. Women also generally ran taverns in medieval Europe, and [women in England ran the entire beer industry back then](https://books.google.com/books?id=c6MQJ-pdbwAC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false). Women who didn't run taverns or grow crops often joined convents, and when education was rare at the time, it gave these women access to education. Thus, nuns could read or write in an era where the most powerful kings couldn't. [If women could eventually rule of a house of nuns, they could reach position of power very similar to a male lord, or even slightly higher, seeing as how they technically reported directly to the King of Kings and whatnot](https://web.archive.org/web/20100215224014/http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/medieval/women2/medievalwomen.html). Sometimes, in monasteries, the abbess had seniority over monks. Outside monastic walls, women could wield political power, especially as queens and regents who exercised royal authority when their husband or underage son was unavailable. A number of powerful queens can be noted in English history, of whom one of the most remarkable was Queen Isabella (1295-1358), who (in collaboration with her lover, Sir Robert Mortimer) ended the rule of her husband, Edward II (1284-1327).\n\n[Even in the Middle East](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1525/ae.1974.1.3.02a00100), women DO influence politics and society. They do it from private positions, and exercise influence over men, by being mediators in natal or affinal groups in marriage alliances, wielders of authority in the domestic sphere, educating their children, or controlling products or property. Women form kinship groups, act as \"data brokers\", mediating social relations in family and society. Women also notify men in their household about what happens in other homes and in extended family. Women also, despite being segregated by sex at times, join with other women in forming solidarity groups and spreading social influence. It helps cause political influence and raises her social status. Women also can influence men's behavior by spreading rumors or gossip, writing mock songs, and spreading social influence to boost or ruin his reputation, especially in social and political issues. Women there might not be in the government, but men rarely make it in the government, and women have so much widely ignored soft power in influencing society and politics, but feminists don't realize in some countries where dictatorships occur, they won't always get what they want, but some of the women's opinions there ARE socially conservative. Women there do influence how people think there and eventually these countries will lose their social norms if people figure their way around their countries' domineering government.\n\nWe have laws pandering to women, including battered women's shelters, campaigns and organizations for women's health, laws against violence against women, etc, but while these politicians are men, they don't make these laws for men. People have always responded to women's soft power historically and politicians' success depended on his support from women more than from men. Men weren't always able to vote historically, but when men served in the military more, they were given the right to vote, but women were still granted soft power that made more changes than mere marks on ballots that only won if a majority. That's why suffragists were originally a minority, but still managed to spread enough influence to become a majority.\n\n**Women were not excluded from history from men, but by feminists.**\n\nIn Chapter 12, Mary Beard wrote:\n\n>Certainly the original sources, which scholars use for the study of men in long and universal history, often mention and even recount stories or give elaborate data of many kinds about women. For example, Herodotus, whom historians of the modern age have called “the father of history,” deliberately included women in his history. Tacitus, the Roman, also observed and commented on the women of his time. Indeed ancient writers in various societies often thought it necessary to consider women and among their works are to be found statements respecting women’s force of character, learning, physical energy, military and political power, and creative intelligence – statements made by the contemporaries of such women.\n\nSo obviously, writers and historians didn't exclude women and even wanted them included. Mary Beard wrote in her book that the idea that women were men's subordinates and were forbidden from contributing to society is one of the biggest myths told in history. Feminists have erased the fact that 40% of slave owners in the US were white women and that women had soft power or even before the 1700s, had royal and aristocratic power, and promoted myths that women were property, were expected to be asexual beings even in marriage, were allowed to be beaten/raped by their husband, or were violently hated. Feminists probably originally removed women's contributions to society from history. Then decades later, feminists wanted to educate society about women's contributions to society they claimed were erased by men because they are clueless about what the first wave feminists did.",

    "text": "I wonder if men of shorter stature are invisible to feminists, or make just as good cannon fodder. You know what they say, \"Men don't have to worry about being safe when walking at night\".\n\nLike this comment:\n\n>The really sad thing is that women even have to consider whether a man is a threat. But this is a reality in the life of a woman. You probably never think twice about walking in a deserted parking garage, or the vehicle parked next to yours with a person sitting in the passenger seat, or getting in an elevator and a man steps in just before the doors close. I guarantee every woman takes her safety into account in these situations.\n\nOh gee, I forgot, that male privilege gives me 100% damage reduction from bullets, punches/kicks, etc.\n\nAnd also: \"It's your duty to intervene, to call out sexism, etc. etc.\" like the infamous Gillette ad four years ago: \"To say the right thing. To act the right way. Some already are. In ways big and small. But some is not enough.\"\n\n\"Men have to hold other men accountable.\" said Terry Crews, the 6'2\"/237# former NFL player.\n\nOkay, now I am 5'7\"/150#, with no athletic inclinations whatsoever. I don't watch any sports at all because it bores me to tears (except classic auto racing, from ca. 1950-2000), I don't know anything about (American) football and don't care to learn because it won't be useful to my life, and with my shorter stature and athletic disinterest combined, thus can't exactly count on physical strength. Do they really think that all men are 6' or taller?\n\nAnd now it's my duty to call out a 6'5\"/250# football player in a cocaine-induced rage because he told one sexist joke.\n\nWhat do they think is going to happen? That this guy will just say \"Oh, hey, you're right, I shouldn't have said that, I will educate myself and try to do better.\" So, tell me you've never met another person before without saying you've never met another person before. This \"~~protect your daughter~~/educate your son\" virtue-signaling. Because I can tell for sure that Bart is totally open to being educated. It's not like he's already an underachiever at school, a prankster and disrespects authority (Homer, Principal Skinner, etc.), calling Homer generally by his first name and not \"Dad\" and [diss raps about him on stage, calling him a fat load.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTsB95Snluc) He'd totally listen, right? And \"saying all men are rapists/it's in their nature is misandrist/insulting to men/shows you have a really low opinion of men\". Opinion is like an asshole, everyone is entitled to one, doesn't mean it's always right. And when did I say that it's in the nature, point out the exact words. Also, France (Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau) did not try to \"educate the Germans\" at the Paris Peace Conference, but really wanted to really punish Germany hard, harsh reparations, territory annexations, the whole nine yards, because they bore the brunt of the WWI horrors. As he said: \"America is far away, separated by ocean, and even Napoleon couldn't touch England. You two are both sheltered, we are not.\" I guess maybe Woodrow Wilson and David Lloyd George should have called him out for \"having a low opinion of the Germans\" or that he was being \"insulting to the Germans!\"\n\nAnyway, back to the main point, more likely, this 6'5\"/250# football player will be throwing me down on the floor and then beating the shit out of me. Like I said, I'm just 5'7\"/150#, so if he wanted to harm me, he is going to succeed at it. So I have to \"be an ally\" and risk life-threatening injuries, and later also pay the medical costs (at best), have to spend my entire life in wheelchair (worse case) or die (worst case), but hey, at least now I have earned some \"ally points\". What a good deal, where and what for can I redeem them? Like Bill Allen said: \"Better to be a live coward than a dead hero. Sure people will still sing about dead heroes from time to time, but aside from that they get little attention. Unless they manage to get a holiday named after them. Even then, it's not like they get to enjoy the day off.\"\n\nSo, actually here's another debate topic. **For men of shorter stature, safety is not a given.** And many of those feminists tend to also be politically more on the progressive-liberal (not necessarily left/leftist) and collectivist/authoritarian side. The side that's usually not so gun-friendly. But if I am two inches below the average American male height, how am I supposed to defend myself? Not that have to actually want to shoot someone, oftentimes the mere sight of a gun will make an attacker think he's not that tough after all and scamper. I mean, it's such a tragedy that the feminists have to walk with car keys between their fingers while walking at night. While if I did that, since I can't count on physical strength, I would only achieve 1) making the assailant angrier and thus 2) reducing my chances of survival, not to mention fucking up my fingers. Or if I carried pepper spray or mace, it would end up right in my face if used downwind. Knife? You know what they say, \"The winner of a knife fight dies in hospital, the loser in the street.\"\n\n**So, for a shorter man, dating may be harder, but there are more important, more pressing issues, like self-defense/self-preservation.**\n\nPostlogue: But hey, if it mainly targets women, then it's all \"society bad, men bad, have to change\". But when the vast majority of the crime victims are men, \\**crickets chirping*\\* Like New York in the 1970s, in the Lindsey and Beame era, when the city was near bankruptcy (Remember the infamous NY Daily News \"Ford to City: Drop Dead\" headline?), and had to \"defund the police\" to stabilize the budget. And the best NYPD could do under those circumstances was to pass out pamphlets at JFK/Newark/LaGuardia saying \"[Until things change, stay away from New York City if you possibly can.](https://archive.org/details/FearCity/)\" Very likely, the vast majority of the crime victims then were men. So will the feminists also agree that all this was victim blaming: \"Stay off the streets after 6 PM, do not walk, avoid public transportation, remain in Manhattan, protect your property, safeguard your handbag, conceal  property in automobiles, do not leave valuables in your hotel room\"?",

I’m honestly here for two reasons, one to get it off my chest and two to see if there’s anyone here with a knowledge of law or general workplace HR to see what I can do. Or possibly thirdly just how I should approach it to other coworkers. Gonna be vague for the sake of being anonymous\n\nSo to start I’m a man who’s in a company mostly in their early to mid 20’s and has work socials at a local bar in New York. A lot of lines can get blurred at these types of things because it’s what happens a lot of the time when you mix alcohol with people you see all the time. \n\nI’m someone who tries to get along with everyone and likes to get to know people and so was out talking to a new woman we’ll call Alex. Alex and I had a lot in common from school and so went outside the bar to smoke and talk. As time went on more and more people outside and things there got really social but mostly guys.\n\nI don’t think I need to convince anyone here that when you get young men gathered and drinking that a few of them probably will say or do some questionable things. I also won’t claim to be the perfect male feminist, but what I heard truly stunned me. \n\nCurrently we have several new people on the job and one guy from a branch in Europe who’s temporarily filling a team leader position. We'll call him Jay. So many of us are socializing around the table. After about an hour or so Alex was on her phone and then motioned that they were leaving. I was caught so off guard that I can't quote exactly but Jay looks at her and asks if she's got a \"dick appointment\"\n\nAlex didn’t really say much but kinda motioned further to leave as several people kinda laughed and he pressed further saying along the lines of yea, she’s got a “dick appointment”. It was the phrase he used that stunned me and probably some others. I soon after confided with a guy I trust who also felt super uncomfortable but I don’t think he’ll act on it. \n\nI want to know what course of actions I can/should take to either have their be repercussions for Jay’s actions or make Alex feel more welcomed. Jay is only here for 2 more weeks and a few managers have a habit of overlooking things if someone is a high scorer. Alex is new and has only been here a few weeks. I have other people at the job I trust including other women, should I go to them first for perspective or advice?\n\nI feel like I should act but if I act then there’s no going back so just wanted to hear some ideas if anyone felt like reading this far",

    "text": "The History of Somatic Symptom Disorder, AKA \"Hysteria,\" and how it has shaped the medical field, ChatGPT, WebMD, and its effect on women today. This is separated by sections with titles in all caps\n\nHISTORY\n\nFrom the American Psychiatric Foundation: \" Somatic symptom disorder is **diagnosed when a person has a significant focus on physical symptoms, such as pain, weakness or shortness of breath, to a level that results in major distress and/or problems functioning**. The individual has excessive thoughts, feelings and behaviors relating to the physical symptoms.\"\n\nWhich is further defined as: \" **The somatoform disorders are a group of psychiatric disorders that cause unexplained physical symptoms. They include somatization disorder (involving multisystem physical symptoms), undifferentiated somatoform disorder (fewer symptoms than somatization disorder), conversion disorder (voluntary motor or sensory function symptoms), pain disorder (pain with strong psychological involvement), hypochondriasis (fear of having a life-threatening illness or condition), body dysmorphic disorder (preoccupation with a real or imagined physical defect), and somatoform disorder not otherwise specified (used when criteria are not clearly met for one of the other somatoform disorders).** \"\n\nFrom [ScienceDirect.com](https://ScienceDirect.com) article by  R.E. Kendell, in [International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/referencework/9780080430768/international-encyclopedia-of-the-social-and-behavioral-sciences), 2001 \n\nHysteria no longer appears in the DSM-5 Nomenclature but....  \"The term hysteria comes from the Greek word *hystera* for womb, reflecting the belief of ancient Egyptian physicians that the phenomena of the disease were due to ‘wandering of the womb.’ [Hippocrates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/hippocrates) and Galen both accepted this assumption and until the late nineteenth century hysteria remained a disease of women and of the body (generally the nervous system).   The idea that it was a purely [psychological disorder](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/psychological-disorder) dates from Breuer and Freud's [*Studies on Hysteria*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/studies-on-hysteria) in 1896, which led to the psychoanalytic concept of hysteria—the dominant explanatory theory for the next 60 years. The demise of hysteria was due primarily to the fact that the term came to be used in a variety of ways that were only tenuously related: (a) neurological conversion symptoms; (b) psychophysiological reactions—a wider concept of conversion including pain and visceral symptoms; (c) dissociative reactions—fugues and amnesic episodes assumed, after Janet, to be based on dissociation of consciousness; (d) outbreaks of mass, or epidemic, hysteria; (e) Briquet's syndrome—multiple, unexplained, somatic symptoms and persistent invalid behavior; (f) anxiety hysteria—an obsolete psychoanalytic term for phobic anxiety; and (g) a personality type assumed to be particularly susceptible to develop hysterical symptoms. Contemporary understanding of hysterical behavior has been influenced strongly by the sociological concepts of the ‘sick role’ and ‘illness behavior’ and by learning theory, and attempts to reduce both the attractions of the sick role and influences discouraging healthy behavior now have a central role in management. This conceptual model explains the distribution of hysterical behaviors in populations, including the predominance in young women, and many other clinical observations, but it fails to account either for neurological conversion symptoms or for fugues and other dissociative phenomena.\"\n\nBasically what this says is that Hysteria was created in 1900BC and was labeled as the \"wandering womb\" claiming that the uterus would move locations and the SOLUTION to this was... Marriage and sex... Well... Sex really. Coitus.\n\nFrom  K. Pajer, in [Encyclopedia of Stress (Second Edition)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/referencework/9780123739476/encyclopedia-of-stress), 2007:\n\n\"Subsequent centuries brought changes in the definition and hypothesized etiology of hysteria. The definition became quite broad, referring to nearly any symptom of disease that was found more often in women than in men. Etiological explanations continued to focus on uterine pathology but also included causes such as satanic possession.\"\n\nThis means that any sort of disorder or symptom that was found in women but not in men was labeled as \"Hysteria\"\n\nAlso from K. Pajer:\n\n \"The nineteenth century brought a dramatic increase in the incidence of hysteria, although it is not clear why this happened. Treatments continued to focus on the uterus and newly discovered ovaries. The cauterization of the cervix, leeches applied to the cervix and vagina, and the removal of the ovaries were all common treatments that were only moderately successful. In the late nineteenth century, however, [hypnosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/hypnosis) was discovered to be useful for curing some symptoms of hysteria, such as the paralysis described earlier in S.M. Janet, Freud, and others believed that the mechanism of this cure was that hypnosis allowed the [therapist](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/therapists), and then later the patient, to gain access to repressed feelings. In exploring these hidden feelings, buried conflicts could be resolved and the symptoms would disappear. The use of hypnosis diminished as Freud developed the technique of free association with interpretation by the analyst. This technique became the hallmark of psychoanalysis and was eventually used for many psychiatric disorders. \"\n\nSYNTHESIS\n\nFrom a Sociological perspective, one could argue that the cultural idea of  can be dated back to 1900BC. \n\nHere's what I mean. You all know what I mean. The concept of no one listening to you. It's not instinctual for men to be like that. It's cultural and sociological and perpetuates an idea that's based in 1900BC. Men have not listened to women about their health issues since 1900BC, to the point where they created a disorder that can be used as an excuse to not listen.\n\nThe concept of \"Hysteria\" has effected so many women today. The last mental asylum wasn't shut down until 1996 with Bill Clinton. Before these mental asylums were shut down, men could drop their wives or any female relative off, and they would not be allowed to leave until that same person came to remove them. If that person died, you would not be returning to normal society. Many women were born, raised, and died in these mental health asylums until 1996.\n\nSo that being said: let's chat. Here's the topic:\n\nThe concept of \"Hysteria\" has created a long-standing, sociological, cultural, and instinctual mindset towards the attitude of women, what we talk about, do, who we are, how the world sees us, and most importantly: how doctors see us.\n\nThis concept is so deeply bred into our culture that the language perpetuated by it is often seen in so much of our media, and is so deeply ingrained in us. \n\nGoing back to what Freud said, claiming it to be \"(a) neurological conversion symptoms; (b) psychophysiological reactions—a wider concept of conversion including pain and visceral symptoms; (c) dissociative reactions—fugues and amnesic episodes assumed,\"\n\nWHICH: the definition of visceral means very real, and relating to soft internal organ systems like the heart, lungs, and reproductive system. Fugues is loss of awareness usually \"associated with forms of hysteria or epilepsy.\" Or, for better words, when you zone out and aren't aware of things momentarily and briefly forget what's going on.\n\nSo BASICALLY that moment where you can't think about anything because your period is absolutely so painful.\n\nThis is basically saying \"Oh yeah is she is a woman, is having some brain fog, and she's feeling pain- it's not real\" which is an idea created by Ancient Egyptians, then perpetuated by Sigmund Freud, the \"Father of psychoanalysis\" which was then put into the DSM-5 because of him and USED TO ABUSE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WOMEN. \n\nthis is like when you're watching a movie, and there's not a single scene where two women are together and they're NOT talking about a man. \n\nOr when you go to the doctor to get an IUD inserted, and they don't provide any cervical dilaters, painkillers, or anything of the sort, and just go right in like we're back in 1900BC.\n\nOr when you go to the doctor because you're crying in pain, and they won't give you painkillers even though you're 3 years clean from opioid addiction, and your pain levels are reading as an intolerable level.\n\nSo, that moment when you tell your boyfriend that you're upset about something, and he doesn't seem to care. The father who claims his daughter's period to be \"not that bad.\" The old-fashioned mother who won't allow you to bring your bathing suit to the pool party because she knows your on your period and doesn't want you to use a tampon. The husbands who ignore their wives pregnancy pain and tells them to \"Just deal with it, it'll be out in a few months anyway\" and then the wives end up dead because it was really a medical emergency.\n\nSO Sigmund Freud is the reason to blame for why you never get help for your period pains.\n\nAnything that is sexist can probably be related to this social idea. In a world where men don't listen to women, the world was created for them and not for us. \n\nI recommend reading \"Invisible Women\" by  Caroline Criado-Perez. In her book she examines many of the things in America that you wouldn't think would be attributed to sexism. Like how the cities are plowed first instead of the small towns because more men drive to work.\n\nCHATGPT AND WEBMB\n\nIf you go to WebMd and search for conditions, with anything that is both related to the brain (neurological) and pain (neurological/inflammatory/receptors that respond to stimuli/yes fish still feel pain) and your gender is set to female, one of the conditions on that list, usually close to the top, is somatic symptom disorder, which is hysteria.\n\nIf you set the gender to male, it will show up if you include general pain like \"muscle pain\" but it is usually farther down the list. If you provide an array of mixed symptoms, it will usually not show up.\n\nWhy is this an issue? Because when you go to the doctor, chances are when they leave and come back, they're going to google or look up all of your symptoms.\n\nHere's what I got from ChatGPT\n\n \n\nHere's a list of ten possible conditions that could cause pelvic pain, brain fog, and fatigue in a 22-year-old woman:\n\n1. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\n2. Endometriosis\n3. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)\n4. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n5. Fibromyalgia\n6. Hypothyroidism\n7. Depression or anxiety disorders\n8. Iron deficiency anemia\n9. Interstitial cystitis\n10. Urinary tract infection (UTI)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this instance, it labels Depression and Anxiety as \"Mental health conditions like depression and anxiety can cause physical symptoms such as pelvic pain, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating.\"\n\nWhich, is partially true, but to me it seems like the pain, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating would be the thing CAUSING the anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression is a real thing, but most oftentimes, they are comorbid with something else. (Please correct me if I am wrong.)\n\nI did it again, with better more specific results.\n\n\"based on the symptoms you described, here's a list of ten possible conditions that could explain a woman's lower abdominal pain, difficulty concentrating, warm feeling over the uterus, intense cramps, delayed period, and a false pregnancy test result:\n\n1. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): PID is an infection of the reproductive organs that can cause lower abdominal pain, fever, abnormal vaginal discharge, and delayed periods.\n2. Endometriosis: Endometriosis is a condition where the tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside of it. It can cause pelvic pain, cramps, delayed periods, and difficulty concentrating.\n3. Ovarian cysts: Cysts that develop on the ovaries can sometimes cause lower abdominal pain, delayed periods, and discomfort during activities like bending down.\n4. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): PCOS is a hormonal disorder that can cause irregular periods, lower abdominal pain, and difficulty concentrating.\n5. Ectopic pregnancy: Although the pregnancy test was negative, an ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. It can cause lower abdominal pain, delayed periods, and sometimes a warm feeling or discomfort.\n6. Uterine fibroids: Fibroids are noncancerous growths in the uterus that can cause lower abdominal pain, cramps, and delayed periods.\n7. Ovarian torsion: This occurs when an ovary twists, potentially causing severe lower abdominal pain, cramps, and delayed periods.\n8. Gastrointestinal issues: Certain gastrointestinal conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can cause lower abdominal pain and difficulty concentrating.\n9. Stress or anxiety: High levels of stress or anxiety can lead to physical symptoms like abdominal discomfort, delayed periods, and difficulty concentrating.\n10. Hormonal imbalances: Imbalances in hormones such as estrogen and progesterone can affect the menstrual cycle, leading to delayed periods and associated symptoms.\"\n\nThird try, here's the whole conversation:\n\nChatGPT: \"I'm not a doctor, but based on the symptoms you described, here's a list of ten possible conditions that could explain a woman's false pregnancy test, missed period, muscle pain, localized cramps, fatigue, and emotional changes:\n\n1. Pregnancy: While the pregnancy test was false, it's still possible for a woman to be pregnant and have a negative result, especially if the test was taken too early. In some cases, pregnancy symptoms can manifest even with a negative test result.\n2. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): PCOS is a hormonal disorder that can cause irregular periods, muscle pain, and emotional changes.\n3. Uterine fibroids: Fibroids are noncancerous growths in the uterus that can lead to missed periods, muscle pain, and localized cramps.\n4. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS): PMS is a condition that can cause muscle pain, cramps, fatigue, and emotional changes in the days leading up to the menstrual period.\n5. Hormonal imbalances: Imbalances in hormones like estrogen and progesterone can disrupt the menstrual cycle, leading to missed periods, muscle pain, and emotional symptoms.\n6. Thyroid disorders: Conditions such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism can cause hormonal imbalances, leading to missed periods, muscle pain, fatigue, and emotional changes.\n7. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS): CFS is a complex disorder characterized by persistent fatigue that lasts for at least six months and is not relieved by rest. Muscle pain and emotional symptoms can also be present.\n8. Fibromyalgia: Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and emotional changes.\n9. Post-acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS): PAWS can occur after substance addiction recovery and can cause various physical and psychological symptoms, including muscle pain, fatigue, and emotional instability.\n10. Psychological factors: Emotional changes, fatigue, and muscle pain can also be influenced by psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, or depression.\n\nIt's important for her to consult with a healthcare professional who can conduct a thorough evaluation, consider her medical history, and perform appropriate tests to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms.\"\n\nME: But if she is actually having pain, would that really be psychological? Because if she is stressed, wouldn't the pain be causing her stress and anxiety?\n\nChatGPT: \"You're right, pain itself is a physical symptom and should not be dismissed as purely psychological. Stress and anxiety can indeed contribute to the experience of pain, and in some cases, they can amplify or exacerbate physical symptoms.\n\nWhen it comes to pain, it's essential to consider both physical and psychological factors. Stress and anxiety can lead to muscle tension, which may manifest as muscle pain. Additionally, psychological factors can influence how pain is perceived and experienced, affecting an individual's emotional well-being and overall stress levels.\n\nIt's crucial to approach the situation with a holistic perspective. A healthcare professional would take into account the individual's symptoms, medical history, conduct a physical examination, and potentially order additional tests to determine the underlying cause of the pain. They will consider both physical and psychological factors to provide a comprehensive diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\"\n\nME: Aren't you afraid that by including psychological disorders, that you'd be perpetuating the old and misinformed idea of hysteria? \n\nChatGPT: \"I apologize if my previous response gave the impression of perpetuating outdated notions or stigmatizing psychological disorders. It is not my intention to promote such ideas.\n\nIt is important to approach health and well-being from a biopsychosocial perspective, recognizing that physical symptoms can be influenced by various factors, including psychological ones. Mental health is an essential component of overall health, and it is crucial to consider the interconnectedness of physical and psychological well-being.\n\nHowever, it is equally important to emphasize that physical symptoms should not be dismissed or solely attributed to psychological factors without appropriate evaluation. Healthcare professionals aim to provide comprehensive and individualized care, considering all potential causes and utilizing evidence-based practices for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIf you have concerns about the portrayal or understanding of psychological disorders, I encourage you to engage in open dialogue with healthcare professionals and seek information from reputable sources to ensure accurate and compassionate perspectives are shared.\"\n\n.\n\n So, from what I've seen it tells me that ChatGPT is going to be more reliable than googling your symptoms, using WebMD symptom checker, or anything else, and honestly it probably will help you be more successful at determining whether or not you actually need to go to the doctor. And will take into account your symptoms on an equal level. It is probably going to be better at determining comorbid conditions.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nShare with me. Tell me your experiences like this, at ANY time where you felt that someone ignored you, disrespected your body, didn't listen to you when it was important, told you to \"just suck it up\" when you shouldn't. Share with me any time a doctor didn't listen to you or ignored your symptoms. Share with me any time ANYONE discounted how you felt, what you believed, the way you dress/dress/who you are/ANYTHING. If not, share with me what you think, what you have to say. I want to know what everyone has to say.\n\nThis problem of the medical field not listening to women has GOT TO STOP. \n\nTLDR: This misinformation that dates back to 1900BC, which labels \"Hysteria\" to be pain in a major organ system (like the uterus/ovaries) and brain fog (symptom of period pains/PMDD/ADHD/epilepsy/etc. the list goes on) is the head contributor to this social ideology that we live in today, which is present in the workplace, day to day life, in relationships, the medical field, and so much more.",
