    "text": "Internship advice: Asking for an internship So last year I met the CEO of a company that deals with software and electronics  (My major). The person is from Japan, he was really nice and gave me his business card and told me to visit him if I ever go to Japan. I've emailed him a couple of times during holidays, but I always wanted to ask him if there is an opportunity for a internship in his company, but I feel that would be rude to ask. Summer is coming and I was thinking of asking him, but I feel nervous about it; maybe some of you have an advice for me. I don't have any prior internships, but I am in an intermediate level in Japanese.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you",
