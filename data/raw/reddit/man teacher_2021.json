    "text": "I'm going insane trying to get a job. Howdy folks, sorry for the upcoming rant/essay. But I think I must have messed up my chances of ever finding a job. So yea, a possibility of a future living on food stamps and sleeping on the street might actually happen, which has got me very badly freaked out.\n\nEssentially, I'm currently a highly disillusioned undergrad rising senior with a useless major (history). The plan was to go to graduate school for education and become a teacher, but some recent financial issues in my family scuttled that plan - plus the fact that while I definitely tried in school, I didn't try my absolute best to be honest, so my grades are mediocre but nowhere close enough to get any scholarships or anything, or get into one of the big-name schools that would be worth shelling out deep student loans for. With how useless my history degree is going to be alone now that I've lost the original plan, I've just started falling apart academically. I've literally spent my entire life studying and writing, and I haven't learned any skills that anyone would pay me for. I'll literally just have a fancy piece of scrap paper, and a bunch of papers and essays that are only worth the few bucks I might be able to earn from selling them to some other student to copy, I guess. This isn't the 19th century, you can't get paid to be a thinker or a man of letters anymore. Should've taken computer science I guess. What the hell was I thinking?\n\nIn a final act of desperation, I shotgunned out almost 400 applications to various internships that I might remotely qualify for, since this summer would be the last one before graduation. At least one internship might be better than none. The previous three summers I spent working as a teacher overseas, but with the shutdown of my teacher plan, I need some sort of other experience to give myself a fighting chance at finding any other white collar job. After all of these applications - which I made sure to custom-write cover letters and resumes for each single one - I got a single interview. Within a week I figured out was just a MLM scheme, so I ended up not taking that. So there goes any chance at entering an office job at all.\n\nFine, so I suppose I have zero chance at getting an office job. But at the very least, maybe I can get some unskilled blue collar job? They don't pay as well, but at least I've have a tiny chance of actually being able to live. Once again, I began shotgunning applications (although this time I kept it to within a 20 mile radius of the city where I live, because I'm not moving cross country for minimum wage). Obviously I don't have the skills or the background to apply for any of the skilled blue collar work, so plumbing and elevator repair and stuff like that was obviously out of the running, but pretty much everything else that didn't explicitly ask for educational requirements beyond high school or work experience was fair game for me.\n\nOut of around 150 applications I fired out, I only got responses from maybe 15 or so. I use \"applications\" lightly, since for some of these (like roofing - literally the one job that supposedly takes high school dropouts) literally ask you to just call a number.\n\nOut of the 15 or so that actually responded, I got 0 offers. Literally nothing. Now admittedly I can perhaps understand why I might get rejected from construction - I don't have an OSHA 10 card, and my only relevant experience comes from helping a cousin finish his basement, so the clerk at Home Depot probably has more qualifications than I do.\n\nWhat really drives me mad though is the fact that I got rejected from jobs high schoolers take on summer break - somehow, I got rejected from Burger King. 7-Eleven at least gave me an \"interview\", where I gave the standard generic answers to all of their questions, then said they'd call me, and obviously never did. What makes me even more mad is that they literally had a giant sign on the outside saying that they were urgently hiring. Should've said \"Urgently Hiring, except for You\". And of course, they never told me why I got rejected.\n\nThe only job that told me why I got fired was a small veteran-owned flooring company; while they were looking for people to commit for a career, and I was just looking for summer work (for now), I called them anyway since they literally had \"we need people\" on the bottom of their job posting. Seemed to be going well at first, despite my initial short-term schedule I was completely willing to return once I graduated and keep working for them, and I made sure to let them know that. They asked the standard interview questions, I talked a little about how I wanted to learn a skill and find some honest work, and they sounded pretty happy to take me on - talking a ton about what the schedule was like, what my duties would be, the pay, and an approximate timeframe of when they wanted me to start figuring out how to do the job. While the pay was pretty low, it was an honest job, and once I started learning the ropes I would be earning bonuses and raises, so I was fine with it too. Right before the end of the call they asked me a bit about why I was only looking for a summer job, which was when I let slip that I was in college. The tone of the entire conversation changed right there; all of a sudden they weren't talking as much and were clearly trying to end the call. I suppose as a veteran-owned company with a ton of combat vets on payroll, they probably look at millennial college-goers like me as complete cupcakes unwilling to get our hands dirty or work more than a minute straight without looking at our phones. I legitimately wanted to learn a skill so at least I'd have some options for a job after graduation, and this company would have been a great opportunity to learn at least something employable. Obviously they never said that me going to college was the issue, but judging by the way they talked before and after, it's probably that.\n\nIronically, the only job I really ever had, at a coffee store, I ended up quitting. My parents still firmly believe in the old \"any degree gets you any basic job, you don't need to worry about internships or your major\". Probably worked in 1980, but definitely doesn't work now. While they paid for most of the bill for college, I decided to get a job at that coffee store just so I wouldn't have to take so many student loans. But pretty quickly my parents started complaining that I was clearly not trying at school, because after all, this job was a \"loser job\", that only drug addicts or ex-cons or whatever do, and if I just spent my entire time studying I could land a \"proper job\". Eventually they threatened to kick me out of the house if I kept working there, so I quit. Of course, now my degree is going to be nearly worthless, and I can't get a job anywhere to save my life.\n\nSo I have the wrong major and no relevant experience for entry level jobs or internships (even being the guy that just makes photocopies of stuff all day, Jesus!). Somehow I keep getting rejected for fast food, service, and retail jobs. And by just going to college, I've been basically blacklisted by blue collar jobs. And now I don't have the finances to go to grad school. Or the motivation for that matter. I've felt my motivation to do anything academic just completely collapse over the last few months. Going to grad school with my current mental state might just result in me flunking out. I feel completely disgusted with myself. All I've done for my entire life since first grade is study and write, and that's gotten me absolutely nowhere. The news keeps repeating that restaurants need workers. Construction folks keep talking about how they need more laborers. Every single retail store I've seen has hiring signs up. And for some reason they just don't want me. Yes, I'm aware that they have no obligation to hire me, but what the hell am I qualified to do? Why does even fast food reject me? I don't have tattoos or anything, I dress and look reasonably neat, I don't have any major physical disabilities, I'm literally just a typical 21-year-old human male. I've got no criminal history or anything else I can think of that would immediately disqualify me from a job. I'm polite and smile when I come in, and I don't do any drugs. I'm willing to show up on time and do my job. Somehow that's not what they're looking for.\n\nI'm literally going crazy. I can understand why I might not get a job as an office assistant (with all the other \"useless major\" grads fighting for any white collar job available), but how the hell am I getting rejected by Walmart and McDonald's of all places? Help me out folks, can anyone think of anything else I'm missing here? I'm just depressed as hell. I started out as a freelance musician while in high school making decent money before an injury, then I taught English abroad making really good money before this, and now I'm staring at the possibility that I might not be able to get a paycheck at all. God, how the hell did I mess up so badly in four years? I'll stop ranting now.\n\ntl:dr what are possible reasons why an average-ish person might get rejected from manual labor or fast food jobs?",

    "text": "Indian company scammers Some may ask:  \nWhen should I give a hiring company my SSN?  \nWhen should I give the recruiter my birthdate?\n\nThe answer is NEVER.  \n\n\n# NEVER GIVE YOUR PRIVATE INFO TO A HIRING AGENCY.\n\nYou will have to fill out tax paperwork for a new job, but that's after interviewing and the whole process is complete. Know what company you're applying for.  \n\n\nI love Indians, but there are many Indian company scammers sending emails tailored to my resume. Then they'll ask for my SSN, driver's license, birthdate, and ids. The reviews make them look real. These scammers are getting better at English, but typos are still present. Their websites look great, and they hook it all up with social media like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. The social media have posts as old as 2015, but some are finally getting shut down when people point it out.  Look out for the physical addresses too. They are usually large buildings with many offices, but they're not really there. One company, I called their main line  833-785-5777 : I got a robot with 5 options: only the third made the phone ring. No one answered the first ring, but then an Indian man answered the 2nd call. They deal in identity theft, and they're good at covering it up. I think they may be routing it all from India. It's getting to the point where I don't like phone calls or emails from Indian recruiters... but some of my best friends, coworkers, and teachers have been Indian. I've even been to a Holi celebration in Georgia. They must be profiting off someone's identity... stop feeding the scammers. Educate your friends and family.  \n\n\nSome examples that I've seen recently:  \nEmonics LLC: [https://www.emonics.com/](https://www.emonics.com/), [https://www.linkedin.com/company/emonics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/emonics)\n\n[http://infopeoplecorp.com/](http://infopeoplecorp.com/) (notice it's http without https)  \n[https://softstandard.com/](https://softstandard.com/), [https://www.linkedin.com/company/softstandard/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/softstandard/) (notice that the CA and NJ phone numbers are the same) (this was more appealing with a nice lady that called me, but then she was texting for my SSN, and said I could not proceed without giving her that info)  \n\n\nEven with these red flags: NEVER GIVE YOUR PRIVATE INFO TO ANYONE... I know it's hard to determine when looking for work. That info should never be before an interview without proper processing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iu8xvbbwusb71.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=b34b11a5e8708000e70f17d8bc63e77e22c95ade",

    "text": "How do I transition from retail to professional? My whole life, due to my autism and my family’s low finances I was told by teachers, community leaders and guidance councillors that I was born to be a burnout and work at Walmart. Always, the eager overachiever I set out five years ago to prove them wrong and make myself a better life. I want an office job, I learned early on that no one would hire me as an administrative assistant and I need a specific degree. \n\nRight now, I’m a civil engineering student with a 3.4 GPA trying to get experience in a professional environment, obviously applying for internships but also any office jobs I can find that fit my study hours. My entire industry was basically destroyed by the virus and in my downtime I’ve begun applying to lots of places. What employers seem to look at isn’t my years of university but my eighteen years of manual labour, retail and food industry experience. \n\nI talked to my therapist about this and he had the same issue. Because he didn’t want to flip burgers, he paid his way through his two degrees and his masters program by being a semi-professional MMA fighter. Then, when he graduated no one would hire him, forcing him to start his own practice. \n\nThere seems to be an impenetrable barrier between retail and professional. I have a great resume, I have bulletproof references, I’m confident, not cocky in interviews, I’m a company man and am willing to take on any task. What do I need to do to show employers my potential?",

    "text": "Job as a way to pay the bills I think this is going to be quite an unpopular post here but there's something I've been seeing quite often: a job/career is just a way to pay the bills and that you shouldn't attach yourself to it or let it into your personal life. This to me is quite depressing to see because a job takes up to 8 hours a day 5 days a week. Then outside those hours you have commuting time, cooking, cleaning, taking care of others things etc which for some people doesn't leave a lot of spare time for yourself. I'd like to do more than trade an hour of my life for an hour of free time and that time at work is also time in my life I will never get back. This is why I choose careers which have meaning to me and jobs where I don't dread going to. For example: ecology research, pet shelter, park ranger and a teacher. They were more than simply a way to make money and felt meaningful to me. I sometimes worked more than I was required because I wanted to, I'd come home and do more research or prepare a cool lesson and sometimes I actually couldn't wait to go in the next day. This isn't a 'if you love what you doing, you never work a day in your life post'. More often than not, I was working and often the work was not necessarily enjoyable/pleasureable. Sitting for hours on end in the hot, humid Malaysian jungle I just couldn't wait to get out of there sometimes or dealing with a class of hormonal teenagers. The problem is the negative conotations that come with 'work'. During my jobs, I knew that I was working but I didn't have the misery that came with other jobs, jobs I did **just** to earn money and get out of there ASAP. Jobs where I just wanted to do the bareminimum and not spend more than a single second. Jobs that I dreaded going to.\n\nI am against trying to turn your hobbies into a career because soon, what makes them hobbies often fades away. I love playing basketball, gaming and woodworking but I'd never try to turn them into careers. Again, it's about finding something that's **meaningful** to you so you don't feel you are simply giving up your finite time for cash. Work doesn't just have to be for survival. I know that if I'm going to invest my time and energy, I want to make sure it's something beneficial to society/humanity and possibly long lasting. Now I don't think of retiring early anymore or 'if only I won the lottery' because I'd still be doing what I'd be doing. I understand that there is life outside work but work also takes up a huge amount of our time because let's say you didn't have to work, what would you do? You can't fill up your time with just hobbies and leisure because it will become very boring and very empty really fast. \n\nWhy am I posting this? When I was younger I used to spend a lot of time on threads like this and I developed that mentality of a job as just being a way to earn money and you should distance yourself from it. I also got the idea that almost every job market was saturated so I avoided a lot of careers from it yet I saw pretty much **everyone** I know get jobs in their fields that were supposedly hard to get into despite not being overachievers and some rather the opposite. Despite everyone posting how bad the job market, it's all anecdotal just like my experience. Literally, one of my friends who barely passed uni (2.1/4 gpa), didn't go to a very reputable one, took time off, had NO work experience was able to land a civil engineering job working in state railways just a couple of months after she started looking. I was supposed to have a job and make money and I did, but the money was never worth it. I was throwing 8 hours away almost every single day for something I didn't believe in or care for (jobs like retail, banking and corporate, although retail was quite tolerable but I couldn't imagine it long term). If you believe that a job is just a way to make money and pay the bills then that's fine. I'm just offering an alternative view on what work should be and honestly, something that changed my life entirely (god damn did I get depressed everytime I just heard the word 'work' because it was anti-life). There's a reason Elon Musk still works 70 hour weeks even though he's the second richest man in world and I don't think it's just money. It's for those who aren't sure what they want to go into and like me, knew deep down that work as just a way to pay the bills is depressing as hell. Most of what people post on here is anecdotal and are mostly negative. It is not an accurate representation of the real world (you'd likely find one just hearing peoples experiences) and you should just pursue whatever career you want despite what other people tell you. It's **okay** to make your career part of your identity. But most importantly, don't ever sell your soul, don't just chase money or material objects and don't ever let any company push you to do what you don't agree with or consider unethical. I don't often use the term 'What do you do for a living?' anymore because I don't do something to live, I live to do something I want.",

    "text": "A colleague-turned supervisor is retaliating and smearing me because I applied to the same promotion. I  am a math and computer science teacher at a small private school.  We  have grades 7-12 and about 120 students.  I've been working here since the Fall of 2018.\n\nI've been active in my department.  I've done a lot of things, successfully, putting in  extra hours at the request of the old and new owners.  I directed the  re-furbishing of our previously unused wet labs, created an AP Calculus  pilot program (all of our students passed despite it not being an  official AP class), created a competitive Math team which has met with success locally, participated in  recruitment drives to get new students, and even sat in on interview panels.  I have had consistently good  reviews from my students and I'm on decent terms with the President of  the Parent-Teacher Association (whose daughter said that I am her  favorite teacher).\n\nThis year, our school came under new management.  Their goal is to re-organize and expand the school.  They want to focus only on high school (9th to 12th only), and expand the enrollment.  Our school is built for about 300 students, but we currently only enroll 120.  One of the things they're doing to prepare for expansion is to hire department leads, as new teachers will have to be hired.  Currently, they only proposed three team leads: STEM, Humanities, and ESL/Foreign Languages, as or school is pretty small.\n\nI  decided to apply for the STEM department lead job.  In theory, it was open to all comers, and I figured I had nothing to lose.  I had done a lot of additional work and gotten excellent reviews from the old managers.  I was also in the process of obtaining alternative certification.\n\nInitially, the departments were allowed to choose their own leads, and initially I had been chosen by ballot.  Two weeks later, the head of HR  sent out an e-mail saying that I would not be promoted, and instead another teacher - let's call her Alice - would be.  I requested a private meeting with the head of  HR (part of the new management) to discuss why.  They claimed there was nothing against me, and that she was promoted because she worked there longer than I did.  That didn't make any sense, since new management fast-tracked one of their own into the Foreign Language lead position.  They also mentioned something about how they believed that I would not be able to execute my position \"fairly\".\n\nLater, I found through investigation of my own that she ran a Twitter campaign to get her friends and family to call in so that she could get the promotion.  She smeared me and the other people in the department as \"participating in anti-blackness and exism\"  (she's Black and Filipina, while I'm a man of Latino/Chinese ancestry).  Me simply because I accepted the promotion, and others for voting for me.  She even asked her friends if they could make fake screenshots of me saying racist things.  I then went to HR with the evidence in hand.  HR told me that they didn't receive any phone calls, and furthermore said that they could do nothing about the tweets because they were made off the clock.  They said they were going with Alice as department lead and that decision was final.\n\nAnyhow, since she got the position, Alice has been very  hostile to me.  She seems to be building a case to let me go at the end of  the year.  For instance, she has been conducting reviews of my classes  and has given me unreasonably low scores (straight 0's or 1's out of 10).  Under previous management, I have never gotten a review averaging less than a 7.  She also changed my teaching load so I'm no longer  teaching Calculus, but I'm teaching 7th grade math (a class which will be eliminated next year, thus making my job redundant).  She's asked me to prepare presentations only to not let me give them in meetings, as well as filed bogus complaints with HR.\n\nShould I start looking for a new job, or should I try to fight this and get my position back?",

    "text": "Asking about your predecessor Background: I just got an offer for a new job as the Director of a childcare within a large church (I myself am not religious but have been promised I will not have anything to do with the religious aspects of the program). \n\nI am coming up on nearly 8 years at my current workplace, which I have finally decided to leave for a multitude of reasons; primarily that I have been qualified for the director role for a few years now and am only being held back by my director's contract length. She was not up front with me regarding her length and has been telling me for nearly 3 years that she plans to leave 'soon', at which point her position will be mine. Finally, she let me know that she will be at least another 3 years in the position, at which point I started looking elsewhere. \n\nThrough the interviewing process at this church - which has a larger amount of resources, is licensed for more children, offering me higher salary and position, and seemingly happier/less stressful environment - they asked that I meet a couple staff members to see how we get along. One of the staff members has been with the church for 20+ years and working in the childcare & preschool section since it opened almost 5 years ago. It seems as though since she has been there since the beginning and holds a non-official leadership role in the team, they wanted her to have a chance to put in her 2 cents (though they were clear that this would not necessarily impact their decision to hire). \n\nWhile talking with this teacher, her main point seemed to revolve around the previous director and how he was let go. My understanding through our conversation is that he was separated from the team quickly and with little notice, and that the team is still slightly shocked and some of them upset by the loss, as he supported the team and did his job well, his are big shoes to fill. She also mentioned that dispite the quick loss of the position, he still brings his children to the center with his 'head held high'. \n\nI did a little digging and found the man online, and learned that he is the only director that has been there since they opened the childcare location. \n\nThis leaves me to wonder, what is the reason for the quick separation? The lack of director has obviously put them in a tough spot since March, as the woman who hired me (Director of Operations) has no childcare experience and seems to be struggling to make decisions based on any sort of logic in relation to the guiding factors of childcare such as licensing and accreditation criteria, etc. \n\nWould it be appropriate for me to ask the director of operations what the reason for the quick dismissal of my predecessor was? Mind you, I didn't ask to speak to the staff, she asked me and left me with them. My thought was to approach with, 'when I met with X, she mentioned the original director quite a bit and said that the team was still quite shocked by his hasty separation from the institution, if it's not too sensitive, may I ask what lead to the quick dismissal?' \n\nIs this a faux pas, or a smart move?",

    "text": "Anxiety about future and Career (Substitute Teacher to Teacher) Im a 30yo Man. I went to college for pastoral work and graduated in 2013, I did three internships working at different churches, but have never found a staff position at a church. One of the internships I did was at a church in Hawaii which was from 2016-2017. After my internship I figured what the heck i'll stay in Hawaii until i get hired by a church. I interviewed for a lot of church positions but never got hired. \n\nI juggled a few different jobs here and there and eventually became a substitute teacher because it was my best option at the time.\n\nSubbing in Hawaii isn't a bad gig you get paid $170 a day, get calls every school day, the hours are short about 6 hours, but really 4 or 5 hours because you get a 45 min lunch break and most of the time get a free period unless they call you to fill in another classroom. The time goes by fast, and you do something different everyday. Sometimes there are fun and interesting things to do too, like school assemblies, dance classes, hawaii immersion (this is where guest comes into a classroom to teach about hawaiian culture and history), When I subbed in band class (I don't know how to play any instruments) I turned it into a talent show. There were also days when I would just oversee recesses, or fix things around the school, sometimes I became the crossing guard. There are days I would become a parapro and work with just one special needs student, and other days I taught special ed, and there was the time I taught extremely special needs students which turned into making popcorn and watching a disney marathon. I got to watch spelling bees, play students in chess, teach deaf children with an interpreter translating for me. I taught gym for 2 weeks with no provided lesson plans which equated to doing recess during which I got to really talk with my students and get to know them. I've taught in school suspension where im in a class of just kids who got kicked out of other classes (not as bad as you would think). I would walk out to say goodbye to my students as they are loaded onto busses and wait by the car line, and I would give them high fives and joke around with them. \n\nThose where all the good parts about being a substitute teacher. The bad parts, is that while  it is a good gig it's just a just a gig. I get payed a flat rate with no chance of pay increase. You don't have any stability and I often get anxious if I don't fill my calendar. The school year also has a lot of breaks that you don't get paid for. \n\nThen there are the behavior problems I've had to pull students off of each other for fighting multiple times. I have had students try to fight me. Then there are just bad classes, the groups of students that are a seemingly from hell incarnate, classes where students break all the rules and go nuts. luckily enough I can call the security guards and have students be pulled out of class, but I hate doing that even though I do it fairly often, I would also have security just come to the classroom and not take anyone just so they know I can get them there at any time. \n\nthen there are the principals most of which are nice and just happy that you are subbing at their building, but some are just downright intimidating and demanding. Like if I have a class get out of control blaming me for the students bad behavior, which is fair but some classes try to \"punish subs\" and can get overwhelming and it brings down the hammer on me. I also got in trouble for reclining and putting my feet up on the desk during one of the free periods when I didn't have a class.\n\nI moved from Maui to Michigan during covid and thought this will be a great chance to do interviews for churches because i'm so much closer to many of the church's i would like to work in. Well unfortunately a year later I came up short again.\n\nSo here I am 30 years old looking to make some moves. I decided to do a program called iteach which will allow me to get a teaching certificate. i have to show them that I have a 4 year degree and pass a test which I took today and passed. The program is $4000 and will be 6 months of online school, followed by 1 year of teaching before I get a standard teaching license.\n\n1. first off i'm afraid that i won't actually get hired as a teacher (which is one of the requirements of the program) as they dont help place you, they give you a document that shows you are in a licensing program and will become a certified teacher by the end of the year, but it up to me to get hired through the normal processes, and i am pretty scarred from all of the years of getting rejected from churchs.\n\n 2. Second thing is that I don't really want to be a teacher (not that I dislike being in the classroom), I really want to be a youth pastor. I just can't seem to make that happen. the actual hope in becoming a teacher is to make my youth pastor resume look better.\n\n3. Third thing i'm scared of is getting difficult classrooms, and a hard ass principal.\n\n4. Forth thing i'm scared of is the amount of work it will take. i'm going to go from a pretty unstable but low stakes position, to a position with a lot more responsibility. I think I can do it, but I don't know how much it's going to take out of me.\n\nAll in all I feel pretty foolish. I'm down on myself because i thought I would be further into a career by this point in my life, and i wonder if i'll ever be able to buy a house. \n\nSpeaking of housing i can't seem to find a place to live other than one place that charges $1600 a month which is about half of my income on a good month. My family is encouraging me to take the place and promised to offset some of the cost, my last place was $1200.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn general teaching in hawaii get a bad wrap for 1 thing in particular, low wages i would start off making $38,000 for one year followed by making $50,000 for the next five years, and finally at year 6 it tops out at $52,000. If i get a masters it then tops out at $56,600 Phd $67,000.  \nFor comparison a Sub will make $30,600 if he has perfect attendance, but it is goes down $170 for each day they miss.\n\nim looking at paying $19,200 in rent.\n\nSo i just ask myself; Am I doing the right thing?",

    "text": "What kind of future/career advancement is there in working for an organization that facilitates students doing a semester abroad? So I (34M) have been an ESL teacher in Spain for the last 6 years. I had a smattering of jobs before that but nothing that would amount to a career. Teaching has been great (sort of) but I decided that it isn't what I want to to long term and I needed to start thinking about alternatives while continuing to live in Barcelona, which is where I have built my life.\n\nLast year, I ended up doing a masters in marketing and sales hoping to facilitate a career change. Now, I knew that no one was going to be busting down my door to get at me for simply having a masters, but man oh man have I been surprised at just how little it seems to matter! I've been looking since May and I got close once but other than that I've had little luck. I can't even find and internship willing to touch me! I can't tell how frustrating and disheartening all this has been.\n\nAnyway, so I recently applied to a Program Coordinator for an organization that facilitates students doing a semester abroad and I have an interview lined up. It honestly seems like an interesting position and something that I could be good in, but I'm getting older and I really need to start thinking long-term. Also, it wouldn't be in marketing, which is fine, but I feel like i will have gotten (and paid for) this degree for nothing essentially. But that might be a but of sunk cost fallacy.\n\nDo you guys think this kind of position could lead to a sustainable career? What sort of experience would this give me to bring to future positions, either abroad or back in the US? Could I take this kind of experience to work at a University in some capacity?\n\nAny other advice would be most appreciated. Thanks!",

    "text": "My Boss isn't giving me any work or responsibilities-should I quit? I (F/26) started a new job a few weeks ago as an \"Administrative Assistant\" to this guy who basically flips houses/property. He isn't a company-just a guy who does this as a living. One of my clients told me about him since she used to work with him and claims that he is reliable. He calls me an \"Assistant Project Manager\" but that's incredibly hyperbolic. I have no knowledge or experience regarding construction or managing a project at all. Before this, I was a freelance proofreader and an English teacher to Korean students. But he took me on anyway and had me come in for two weeks of \"training\". In those two weeks, I'd drive over an hour just to get to his house or cafe (again, he's not a company so no proper workspace), watch as he takes phone calls or follow him around to the house under construction, and go back home. Every time I tried to make a suggestion about how I could help, he'd somehow veer off-topic and then be pulled away to a different phone call. Most of those training days I was there for less than three hours which I consider a fat waste of time since I live so far. He'd send me home because he was busy-I didn't even come in every day of the week. There was no former hiring process, but he did give me a packet full of expectations and what I could expect to be paid monthly. However, he never spoke about it further.\n\n\"Why don't you just talk to him and ask for more responsibilities/make your own work/demand clarification about your payment and start date?\" you may ask. And I'll tell you, I did! I still do! Almost every day. Last week I sent a very firm e-mail to him, asking him once again what it is I can do to help. I've made Excel spreadsheets for his data and contacts, and he says that it's a good idea but then never gives the data to me. I've started learning Project Management software so we can organize our projects, but he doesn't want to use it. I've introduced myself to all of his sub-contractors and had them tell me about their assignments. Hell, I even offered to sort the man's mail.  In the same e-mail, I told him that I *need* clarification and peace of mind about wage fulfillment as well. Will I get paid for that \"training\"? When and how will I get my salary? He didn't even read the email until I was there, at his house, the next afternoon. And even then he couldn't give me a straight answer. I can't say he's scamming me for free labor, because he hasn't given me any work to begin with. \n\nThis week marks the beginning of my full-time employment and I'm here 8-hours a day now. However, I still don't have anything to do. I get to his house after driving for an hour, and before I can even speak he disappears. Today he was on the phone for three hours with me sitting at his dining room table twiddling my thumbs and watching the Today show on his living room TV. I finally got fed up and told him that I'm going to the house that he's working on (since that's what we normally did anyway). He told me to go watch the workers and make sure everything is going smoothly. Obviously, I can do that, but how can I spend an entire workday standing there watching other people work? I just walked around the house looking at stuff I've been looking at for the past two weeks for a few hours until lunch. Nothing had changed from the day before, nothing had gone wrong, and no one had any questions or needed help. I called him and asked him what he wanted me to do after lunch and he told me to go back to the construction site. I am, but I'm just going to stand there for a few more hours until I get my ass back into my car and spend another hour going home. \n\nI understand that at the beginning of a lot of jobs, nothing really happens. The promised monthly salary is amazing, and I've met some pretty cool and talented people. I get to work in a nice part of town and see cool houses being built. It has the potential to be creative and hands-on. However, I am doing this without the security of being in a company, benefits, and I haven't gotten paid yet even for training. I seriously don't know what this guy expects of me and he only tells me \"oh, eventually you can maybe do this\". I don't even have a place to retreat to and do administrative work because he expects me to be on the construction site (no service or wifi, and no place to sit), or at his house (obviously can't be there unless he is also there). My parents suggest that maybe he isn't used to having an assistant or someone to help him, but his subcontractors have told me that he's had them before. I don't want to sit around and wait to work unless my hand is held, but everything about this job is new to me and I need some more guidance. He insists that things will pick up after this project is done, but I'm no sure how much time I can afford to waste here.\n\nMy dad said that this might not be a good fit for me. My mom blames me for not trying hard enough. I could read up on project management and learn more about construction (my dad loves that stuff) but I'm wondering if it would be worth it. I feel like it's too early on for me to act on my own. It's only been three weeks and two of those weeks have been cut short. Not to sound like a child, but this is my first \"real job\" and I don't know what to do. I'm bored out of my mind and frustrated. I admit I am lazy and love downtime, but on *my time*, if that makes sense. I don't want to drive all the way out here for nothing. I want to do my job, get paid, and live my life. Do you think it's worth staying here? Should I look for something more stable?",

My grandma, who was also a teacher, would sometimes look around the corner and listen to how he changed the stories because she loved the reaction of the kids. She said that at first they were confused \"Huhhh??? Why is their mum going to work??\" But soon they wouldn't notice and find comfort in that not every girl has to braid and not every girl has to play soccer.\n\nI just found this a really lovely story about how a man subtly started changing stereotypes in young childerns minds.\n\nRust zacht Opa.",

    "text": "Unlearning: A Message to My Daughter I need to remember what I’ve learned, so that I know what I need to unlearn. For her.\n\n\\-\n\nWhen I was four years old, I remember answering the door without a shirt on. My grandma was watching me and my brothers at home. I guess she invited some guy over. Afterwards, I remember being scolded for letting a man see my bare chest. \n\nI learned that something is wrong with my body. That it needs to be covered and that I’m bad if it isn’t.\n\n\\-\n\nI remember this same grandma sarcastically replying to my young pleadings for candy and toys with: “How do you plan to pay for them? With your good looks?” \n\nI learned that being pretty can get me what I want.\n\n\\-\n\nI remember being told by smiling strangers that my big brown eyes were sure to cause trouble for my dad. I remember being told that I’d need to “fight off” boys. \n\nI learned that boys are dangerous, but that to be wanted by them is a good thing.\n\n\\-\n\nI remember my mom refusing to leave the house before “putting on her face.” I remember thinking that was a funny thing to say—that she didn’t have a face without makeup.\n\nI remember when I started shaving my legs. I asked my mom how often she shaved hers. She said every day. \n\nI learned that it’s important to *always* look your best, and that you’re not really you unless you’re the best-looking version of you.\n\n\\-\n\nI remember hearing and sharing countless “your mama’s so fat” jokes in elementary school. I remember hearing my stepdad tell cruder versions to his friends. \n\nI learned that being fat is such a bad thing that it can bring shame to your family. \n\n\\-\n\nWhen I was ten years old, I remember wearing my mom’s high school cheerleading uniform for Halloween. It was perfect, her school colors were orange and black. I remember outgrowing it within two years and feeling embarrassed and resentful toward anyone smaller than me, including my own mother. \n\nI remember this sentiment being shared amongst my friends, with a popular attitude of “She’s perfect. I hate her.”\n\nI learned that to acknowledge another girl’s beauty somehow detracts from my own. \n\n\\-\n\nI remember spending a hot, summer weekend at my dad’s house when I was eleven years old. My little brother and sister were playing outside in the sprinkler and I’d put on my two-piece bathing suit to join them. I remember my stepmom looking at the hair on my lower back in disgust and telling me that she’d wax it if she were me. I later remember the fixation I developed, crying as I wrote about it in my diary and vowing to save my babysitting dollars to get laser hair removal.\n\nI learned that girls aren’t supposed to have any body hair and that getting rid of it is a top priority.\n\n\\-\n\nI remember my mom asking for “just a small bite” of the numerous birthday cakes, bowls of ice cream, and after dinner desserts we had throughout my childhood. But I never remember her having her own helping. Some of her go-to ‘treats’ were rice cakes and a few tootsie rolls. She was incredibly disciplined with her diet. \n\nI remember wanting to emulate her discipline. When I felt desperate, I remember wanting to starve myself. I didn’t want an eating disorder *per se,* but I wanted to know that I had enough power to stop eating–just to shed those few extra pounds. I remember being hungry and finally giving in. I remember feeling shame that I was too weak to control my body.\n\nOne time I asked my mom what she thought heaven was like. I remember a huge smile crossing her face as she described a place full of food. She said that in heaven you can eat whatever you want without gaining any weight.\n\nI learned that food is a temptation like other vices—meant to be overcome through willpower and discipline. A failure to be fit is a failure of character.\n\n\\-\n\nWhen I was in middle school, I remember hearing about ‘model weight.’ This was the supposed weight limit if you wanted to be a professional model. I didn’t want to be a model, but I wanted to look like one. I remember forever trying to stay under 110 lbs. and never achieving my goal. I remember lying about my weight for years.\n\nI learned that I’d rather pretend to be the ideal weight than to be honest.\n\n\\-\n\nI remember being thirteen and trying on a new bikini I’d bought from a Victoria Secret magazine. I remember bursting into tears because I thought it made me look fat. My mom saw how upset I was and tried to help. She offered advice: always burn more calories than you eat. I remember creating a notebook to track everything I consumed. I remember cutting out photos from fashion magazines of thin women and making a collage on the cover for motivation. I remember showing it to my mom and her smiling in approval.\n\nI learned that dieting is the answer to a thinner, happier life.\n\n\\-\n\nI remember staying the night at my grandma’s apartment. I must have been around twelve years old. I remember her watching some true crime show about violent rape. She told me to pay attention, because it wasn’t a matter of *if* I’d be raped one day, but *when*. \n\nI learned to be terrified of men. I learned to protect myself by doing my best to always appease them. \n\n\\-\n\nI remember being asked several times by boys in high school if I still had my virginity, or “v-card” as we called it. When I said yes, there was always a smile or nod of approval. I also remember being pressured by some of those same boys to have sex.\n\nI learned that there’s almost nothing as valuable as staying a virgin if you’re a girl, and almost nothing worse if you’re a guy. \n\n\\-\n\nI remember being sexually harassed at school. In sixth grade, it got so bad that I began skipping recess and tried to report the boy to the teacher. I was told I should be flattered and to just ignore him. \n\nDuring my junior year, I stopped going to my first period early to avoid the boy who sat on my desk each morning awaiting my arrival. I actively hid from him in the halls and was constantly on the lookout to avoid him during lunch and after school. I don’t remember ever telling him to leave me alone. I think I was afraid it’d make things worse –at least he was friendly when he harassed me. \n\nI remember being sexually harassed at work. I remember hiding in storage closets and walk-in freezers when certain customers arrived. I remember my colleagues covering for me and saying I wasn’t there. \n\nI remember one of my coworkers offering me his entire paycheck if I’d give him a lap dance. \n\nI learned it is normal behavior to be harassed as a female—and that it is something I should tolerate, or even welcome, because it means I’m attractive. \n\n\\-\n\nI remember being seventeen and working my evening shift at a waterfront restaurant as a hostess. It was a slow evening, and an older couple came in. I sat them near the window. The wife immediately left to use the restroom. I proceeded to ask her husband if he’d like water and bread. As I turned around to fetch them, I remember him slapping my ass. I remember feeling flushed with embarrassment and trying to convince myself that he must have meant to pat me on the small of my back. I kept walking. A middle-aged server grabbed my arm as she passed me and sternly whispered into my ear, “Never let a man touch you like that again.” I remember muttering “okay” while my embarrassment flared into a burning shame.\n\nI learned that I *let* this happen to me and that it was my fault if men touched me in inappropriate ways. I learned that it is my responsibility, not theirs, to stop this type of behavior.\n\n\\-\n\nIn college, I remember trying to be “one of the guys” by telling sexist jokes and degrading other women. I remember talking trash about sorority girls and saying things like, “I’m glad I’m a girl so that I never have to date one.” I remember feeling proud when the guys I was around laughed. \n\nI learned that putting other women down is rewarded.\n\n\\-\n\nI remember countless diets. Veganism, keto, fasting, juicing, and so on. I remember trying to exercise more—joining gyms, kickboxing clubs, and yoga studios. I remember feeling elated when I’d lose a couple of pounds. And I remember falling out of my routine repeatedly as life happened; as I moved, travelled, started graduate school, and got pregnant. I remember feeling like a failure. \n\nI remember telling my mom that I was going to start trying for a baby and her advising me that July was a good time to get pregnant because I could wear a bikini before showing, then have the baby, and then lose the weight before it was summer again. \n\nI remember telling our family that we were expecting and immediately hearing about weight—how much my mother-in-law had gained with each pregnancy and how I’d likely never lose it all. I remember my father-in-law jokingly asking me if I could fit back into my jeans when my baby girl was only a few weeks old.\n\nI learned that we measure health based on how our bodies look.\n\n\\-\n\nI remember last week when I looked at my body with despair just two months post-partum. Then I remember that my body created, birthed, and is sustaining a healthy little human. I remember that I have a child and that whether I intend it or not, she’ll learn from me. She’ll watch, she’ll listen, and she’ll learn.\n\nI’ve learned that it’s time to unlearn so much. It’s time to unlearn that harassment is normal and okay and start calling it out. It’s time to unlearn that other women are competition and start actively supporting them. It’s time to unlearn that we’re responsible for the actions of boys and men; it’s time to unlearn fear by expecting better and holding them accountable. It’s time to unlearn that worth is linked to looks; that health and happiness are likened to body size and beauty.\n\n\\-\n\nWhat do you need to unlearn?",

    "text": "In light of the death of Todd Akin, a Republican member of the Missouri House Representatives, who coined the term \"legitimate rape,\" I wanted to highlight some of his colleagues' comments over the years in helping perpetuate the patriarchal rape culture. In 2012, while running for the US Senate, former Missouri House Representative Todd Akin stated, [\"If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.”](https://www.politico.com/story/2012/08/akin-legitimate-rape-victims-dont-get-pregnant-079864)  As someone who [worked for IBM selling computers and ran the maintenance department at his father's steel company](https://news.stlpublicradio.org/government-politics-issues/2012-10-02/akin-embraces-image-of-minuteman-as-he-battles-establishment-including-his-own-party), it clearly gave him the expertise necessary in women's anatomy, biology, and physiology to be able to make this assertion.  Of course, as an anti-choice usurper of rights, what type of man would he be, unless he [physically restricted access to reproductive healthcare clinics for women in need](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/todd-akin-was-arrested-multiple-times-for-physically-blocking-womens-access-to-abortion-clinics-7dda2f38d322/)?\n\nAkin's son, Perry, said, [\"As my father’s death approached, we had people from all different walks of life share story after story of the personal impact he had on them.\"](https://apnews.com/article/former-rep-todd-akin-dead-0a1b944f96eee4b63d9ea57e04c44ca4)  Of this, I have no doubt.  I'm certain that there are millions of women across the globe who would have liked to share the impact your father's life had, and will continue to have, on them.\n\nIn 1990, Lawrence Lockman, a Republican member of the Maine House of Representatives wrote, while serving as director of the Pro-Life Education Association, [\"If a woman has (the right to abortion), why shouldn't a man be free to use his superior strength to force himself on a woman?  At least the rapist's pursuit of sexual freedom doesn't (in most cases) result in anyone's death.\"](https://archive.vn/5cKpD)  Well, in that case, since you make such a perfectly reasonable, rational argument...\n\nIn 1990, Texas Republican gubernatorial nominee Clayton Williams, lamenting poor weather conditions that threatened to cancel a cattle roundup at his West Texas ranch, likened the atmospheric conditions to rape, stating, [“Rape is kinda like the weather. If it’s inevitable, relax and enjoy it.”](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/personal-foul/)\n\nIn 2018, former US Rep for Iowa, Republican Steve King was asked about his stance of not allowing exceptions for either rape or incest in anti-choice legislation.  He said, [\"What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that?\"](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/14/steve-king-abortion-rape-incest-westside-conservative-iowa-representative-birth-iowa-civilization/2007230001/)  Steve King, everyone; noted critical thinker, [construction worker](http://kingconstruction.net/), and [avowed](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/413601-steve-king-members-of-nazi-linked-party-in-austria-would-be-republicans-if) and [unabashed neo-Nazi](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/13/17459908/steve-king-neo-nazi-tweet-retweet).\n\nFormer Republican Senator from Pennsylvania, Rick Santorum, most recently in the news for attempting to erase all remnants of Native Americans from North American soil ([\"We birthed a nation from nothing. I mean, there was nothing here. I mean, yes we have Native Americans but candidly there isn't much Native American culture in American culture\"](https://twitter.com/JasonSCampbell/status/1386685340522536961)), when asked what his views were on abortion in cases of rape and incest in 2012, stated, [\"...the right approach is to accept this horribly created--in the sense of rape--but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way, the gift of human life, and accept what God has given to you...We have horrible things happen.  I can't think of anything more horrible.  But, nevertheless, we have to make the best out of a bad situation.\"](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/santorum-to-rape-victims-make-the-best-out-of-a-bad-situation-a8388910c907/)  Apparently, in the case of rape, it's a gift.  It's a horribly created gift, yet nonetheless, a gift.  However, in the case of incest, it's what?  Just a regular, everyday gift?  A normal byproduct of a fully-functional family life?\n\nAlso in 2012, Richard Mourdock, a Republican candidate at the time running for Senate in Indiana, stated, [\"...I came to realize life is that gift from God.  And I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.\"](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/richard-mourdock-even-pregnancy-from-rape-something-god-intended/)\n\nIn 2014, Montana Judge Todd Baugh sentenced a 54-year-old, admitted child molester, convicted of repeatedly raping his 14-year-old female student, who committed suicide during the course of the trial, to 30 days in jail.  At sentencing, he stated that the victim [\"seemed older than her chronological age\" and was \"as much in control of the situation\"](https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/29/protesters-demand-montana-judge-resign-over-rape-sentencing/) as her rapist.  One month later, in an interview, he defended his decision, stating, \"Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent.  I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape.  It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.\"  [He also added that her death complicated the case](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/28/teacher-rape-montana/2722817/).\n\nIn 2019, a Tennessee Judge Steven Sword sentenced former pastor, David Richards, to 12 years in prison, 60 short of the maximum prosecutors had sought, for repeatedly having raped his adopted daughter over the course of two years, beginning when she was 14-years-old.  Richards maintained his innocence throughout trial, attempting to portray his victim as a rebellious teenager, who only made the allegations, after he had imposed strict rules for his children.  However, his DNA profile was lifted from a seminal fluid sample recovered from the girl's bed frame.\n\n[The judge, in handing down his lenient sentence, stated that he took into account Richard's longtime ministry, the Bible study he began in jail while awaiting trial, and the community support he received from family, friends, and fellow Christians](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/crime/2019/05/09/former-pastor-nets-12-year-prison-term-rape-adopted-daughter-david-lynn-richards/1143006001/).\n\nAt sentencing, over 30 friends and parishioners sat on Richard's side of the courtroom in support of him, while only six appeared for his victim.  One of those appearing on behalf of Richards to argue for sentencing leniency, David Thompson, who shared ministerial duties w/ Richards at their church, said, [\"I find it impossible for me to believe he's guilty of this. His business needs him. His family needs him. Our church needs him.\"](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/crime/2019/05/09/former-pastor-nets-12-year-prison-term-rape-adopted-daughter-david-lynn-richards/1143006001/)  Clearly, his family needs him, since he's such a wonderful father.\n\nAnd, of course, there's the new breed of vitriolic misogynists who, in a single breath, deny rape culture while proliferating it w/ their toxic ideology.  They refer to themselves as \"[Western chauvinists](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys),\" but in reality, [they're nothing but neo-Nazi terrorists](https://www.timesofisrael.com/not-nazi-enough-proud-boys-leader-wants-group-to-fully-embrace-white-supremacy/), and [that's all they've ever been](https://www.adl.org/blog/proud-boys-bigotry-is-on-full-display), so don't be fooled by their rhetoric.  They've now taken to wearing suits and ties and [holding yearly conventions that promise to make \"men masculine again,\" while \"Making Women Great Again.\"](https://the21convention.org/)  Since last year's conference was such disgrace, [this year's conference promises to be an even more hatefully misogynistic experience w/ 17 featured speakers, and in a first, they're actually going to allow to women to speak](https://22convention.com/)!\n\n>Women today are being taught to act more like men. Where has that led us? Skyrocketing rates of broken families, a documented decline in female happiness since the 1970s, endless social and dating dysfunction, and America at the #1 spot in the world for single motherhood. No longer will you have to give in to toxic bullying feminist dogma and go against your ancient, biological nature as a woman, great men and women have arrived to help #MWGA.\n\nIt's pretty clear that this toxicity has led to a rape culture that's just intolerable, and this is just a snapshot of what's taking place in America.  [Gender-based violence has rooted itself in some of the most populous countries in the world, and the problem only appears to be getting worse](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/southasiasource/understanding-rape-culture-in-bangladesh-india-pakistan/).  In other parts of the world, the abuse of women is absolutely horrific, [akin to something the Third Reich did to Jews in the death camps](https://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1233&context=history-in-the-making).  In 2016, an [Indian woman from the state of Rajasthan was gangraped by her husband and his two brothers](https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india-woman-gangraped-by-husband-in-laws-tattooed-with-expletives-over-dowry-336883), then tattooed across her forehead and hands/arms w/ expletives, b/c her family failed to meet the husband's dowry demands.  In 2018, [a 17-year-old Moroccan girl was abducted, tortured, and gangraped by 13 men over the course of two months](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/8/27/morocco-outcry-after-girl-is-raped-tattooed-with-swastikas).  They burned her w/ cigarettes and tattooed her all over her body, including w/ symbols of swastikas.\n\nThis could go on (and on and on and on and on), but there's only so much space available on the Internet.  What's clear is that those who perpetuate this violent culture are the same who propose and legislate the wholly ineffectual laws designed to deal w/ this problem, and they're also those who enforce, prosecute, and adjudicate said laws.  In a sense, it's allowing predators to sit in judgment of predators, while, at the same time, giving them the option to dismiss those they victimize.  I'd say that it's a broken system, except that it's not.  It's a system that's working exactly in the way in which it was intended.",

    "text": "My uncle wrote an entire book defending a convicted rapist and it is horrifying. I just need somewhere to vent. My uncle has been working on this book for 5 years and self-published it recently. He sent Christmas cards out that urged his family and friends to read the book. So I did. \n\nThe entire book is conjecture. The man was found guilty of the rape by a jury and there is video evidence of him confessing. He failed a polygraph. My uncle has know the rapist since middle school and the rapist was his eye doctor as an adult. The rapist was found guilty of raping his mother in law, and the rapist’s children often came to school looking beaten up (reported by teachers). He defends the rapist stating, “he is a good man and I know he wouldn’t do this.” He has no evidence whatsoever. \n\nSome highlights from the book include:\n\n“One of the tragedies of the American justice system that has come to light since the advent of DNA testing is the number of men falsely convicted of rape on the basis of the victim’s eyewitness testimony.”\n\n“How could a woman emerging from a deep sleep and awakening to the shock of her son-in-law raping her have such a vivid memory of the scene?”\n\nParaphrasing- The mother in law waited a year to report the rape. The mother in law saw her rapist 4 times that year before she reported it. Therefore, she is lying about the rape itself because no one would continue seeing their rapist. \n\n“No one rapes their mother in law”\n\n“Men, when was the last time you entertained thoughts of carnal nature involving your wife’s mother?”\n\nThe whole thing is...horrifying to say the least. That my uncle would spend 5 years of his life writing such a book. That this is so important to him. Every time I think our country is making progress, I’m reminded of how terrible people are. ( I understand polygraphs aren’t reliable and there are forced confessions. I totally get how flawed our legal system is. I’m more commenting on how my uncle has poured such much time and energy defending this acquaintance of his, who has been found guilty, rather than feeling compassion for the victim). \n\nBELIEVE RAPE VICTIMS.",

    "text": "I pursued a heavily quantitative job not because I wanted to, but because I wanted to prove I could be a woman with \"hard skills\". While I applaud women in STEM, I have learned that it's more important to applaud women who go unapologetically after WHATEVER career they WANT and feel confident in. I was 20 when I sat down across from my male college advisor in his office. It was the day I decided on my major, and I was nervously excited. I went into the conversation fully ready to narrow in my studies to my university's English department. My excitement, however, quickly dissipated as I sat there listening to the expert across from me talk through the downsides of my major of choice. He showed me career stats for the most recent graduating class. He pointed to my quant scores from the SAT and my performance in a difficult math course I took my Freshman year at the school. \"Are you sure you have thought this through?\" he asked me. \"You are unique with how left-brained you are - you could really thrive in a major that requires that\".\n\nI hesitated, but ultimately I didn't go with my gut. I signed my name under a major he recommended.\n\nI didn't internalize at that moment that I was signing onto something far more important than simply a major that I wasn't passionate about. I was signing onto what would escalate into a 9-year journey of forgoing what I really loved to do, in an attempt to prove myself as a competitive woman.\n\nI remember my family was really proud of me when I graduated with honors in such a \"difficult\" major.  They tried to compliment me by saying things like \"I can't believe you got through x courses\" or \"It makes us so proud seeing you as one of only a handful of women in the honors program for your major\". I remember my siblings were even more proud when I landed a highly quantitative job that came from passing interviews with complicated case studies.\n\nWhat they didn't see was that I was deeply unhappy. I was sleep deprived from 3 years of pushing myself to be competitive with my mostly male peers. Not tired because I was a woman and they were men. But tired because I didn't enjoy what I was learning and doing.\n\nWhen I am brutally honest with myself, I have lived in a state of constant stress when it comes to school and work basically since that day in my college advisor's office. I'd watch classmates, and then coworkers, light up when presented with a particularly large math problem to solve. While they lit up, I shut down. I dreaded school and dreaded work. I was an anxious bubble hovering right on the verge of implosion. I thought it was because I was not cut out for the increasing difficulty. In reality, I just wasn't doing what I loved. My skill I was most confident in was not relevant.\n\nMy favorite video I have of myself as a kid was the one where I proudly showed my parents that I had taught myself how to read out of my older sister's chapter book. I was in Kindergarten. I first felt extraordinary and understood when a high school English teacher pulled me aside after class and said that in thirty years of teaching Freshmen there, he had never read writing as unique and strong as mine. I was quiet, and awkward socially, but I knew I was an excellent writer. Writing became my outlet throughout high school.\n\nUnfortunately, most signs in the world outside of my childhood and time in high school directed me to reconsider the value of being a good writer. I feel confident that this was largely because I am a woman. I was told from seemingly every angle that to be a woman in finance or tech, especially in a highly analytical role, was the paradigm. It was a sure fire way to prove myself as not just equal to men, but potentially even *more capable.*\n\nIn this kind of cultural context, women are subtly directed that to be excellent and on-par with men, we must go out and prove people wrong who believe that men are \"better\" at math. We must shatter the glass ceiling in traditionally male industries. To be a woman who is decent at math and doesn't do that is to be a woman who isn't \"fulfilling her potential\". While I 100% support all women who love those fields and that way of working and thinking in their pursuit of exactly what they want, it wasn't the field I wanted to be in.\n\nDespite some random man telling me when I was 20 that I am \"left-brained\" as if that was some fact, the only fact was that he didn't know me. I did. I truly wish I could go back in time and say a big \"fuck you my brain isn't one-sided, my heart and most unique skill-set is with writing, and that is why I am going to major in English\".\n\nBut, I didn't. Instead, I deeply internalized in that moment a truth that the right side of my brain was - to others - less valuable than the left.\n\nSo. To women who are excellent writers who love story-telling (or who love anything that involves a \"soft\" skill that \"anyone can do\" and rarely \"leads to a high paying job\") please don't listen to the noise. Celebrate young women who love math and will happily kill it in STEM careers. Celebrate young women who love children and learning and want to be kick-ass teachers. Celebrate young women who care passionately about any social topic who could be change-driving activists. Celebrate young women who are opinionated and incredible public speakers who may go on to run a country some day.\n\nMost importantly, go after exactly what you want to study or do professionally without hesitation. Don't let outside noise or expectations drive your decisions. I did. Have I failed miserably? No of course not. I've actually done well based on my job's standards. We are all more capable than we give ourselves credit for. But, I don't enjoy it. It's taken me quite a few years to understand that it doesn't matter what industry I am in or what high profile job I am doing every day. I won't ever shatter a glass ceiling so long as I don't feel *personally* confident and deeply in touch with what I am doing and what value I am adding. Personally, I believe I need to be writing every single day to do that.\n\nSoft skills shouldn't be looked down upon or associated with any one gender. Neither should hard, quantitative skills. Both matter. What matters more is understanding what you love and why, and trusting your gut with going after something with passion. Writing is my spark. I encourage you to identify yours and bring it to life through your studies and career choices.\n\nedit: a commenter made an excellent point that saying that quantitative skills are needed for a career in the STEM field is a generalization that isn't accurate. Many skills are relevant to a fulfilling career in STEM!",

    "text": "My favorite high school teacher turned out to be a pedophile. I just heard some news that has really thrown me for a loop and I feel like this is the only place I can get it out. I (24F) have always loved history and social studies in particular, and took as many APs as possible in the subject when I was in high school. My favorite course of all was AP European history, and the teacher, Mr. B, was my absolute favorite teacher. His lectures were fun and engaging, he encouraged us to be creative and come up with art projects and video productions that connected back to different historical events, and he would tell us his ghost stories from living in a haunted dorm in college when we had time. I always looked back on my sophomore year with great fondness, and it was definitely a formative time for my sense of self. Now, years later, it turns out Mr. B has been arrested for having a sexual \"relationship\" with one of his female students. He was grooming her on Discord, asking for nudes, and had even escalated to physicality DURING THE SCHOOL DAY.\n\nI know this isn't an uncommon feeling, and it's not like this guy was that close to me, but I feel like I've had the rug pulled out from under me. I get sick to my stomach now when I think back to how safe I felt in that man's presence. His predominantly female class was made up of girls like me who were passionate about history and so excited to have a male role model in their life who was respectful and acknowledged their brilliance, sometimes for the first time in their life. His classroom felt like a safe space for me to be confident, to be myself and not apologize for being smarter than the boys. And now I find out he used that safe space to groom a minor, sexually abuse her, and ruin her childhood. I'm so angry and all those memories feel sinister now. Above all I feel so bad for that girl. As an adult now I can see how much an experience like that can fuck you up for life and I pray that she ends up okay.\n\nEvery day it feels like there are more abusers, more men you thought you could trust but can't, more lives ruined. When can girls (and all children, really) just be safe and protected and given the respect they deserve?\n\nAnyway. It felt good to vent and write that all out. To be honest, whenever I have kids, I dearly hope that they think their teachers are all boring squares. At least they can't be taken advantage of so easily.",

    "text": "I was abused by a paedophile for several years as a teen Following the recent trend of posts here, I wanted to share my experience. I had been thinking of sharing for some time:\n\nI must have been about 13 when I met this man on a social media platform designed for the 'alternative' person. The platform was Vampire Freaks (I think?). Let me know if you are aware of it. It took me years to realise that this platform was epidemic for paedophiles. I'll even go as far as saying it's simply an undercover giant paedophile ring and nothing more. It isn't an innocent social media platform, at all. It was a way to facilitate paedophiles meeting with children.  \n\nDuring this time of my life, I was vulnerable. I had (or still have) a plethora of mental health issues which were not yet treated by medication/therapy/techniques. My mental health was out of control. Consequently, so was my relationship with my parents. I was horrifically bullied in school and even my 'friends' would chuck me to the lions at any opportunity if it meant it would save them. Basically, I was trapped in a very suffocating situation where I felt so unloved and that no one cared about me. \n\nIn comes this man. He lived a few towns over. From day one, he promised me the world. He promised to love me, always be there for me, that one day we will live together, he will have a baby with me, he will buy me anything I wanted, he will support me etc. He told me the words I needed to hear and so I was hooked. He also made sure to tell me that my family and friends didn't care for me and he was the only person that did. \n\nCouple this on top of the fact that there is something innate (what do you think?) inside a teenage girl that thinks she is so mature, age doesn't matter, she can handle this situation and there is nothing abusive about this situation. That this situation isn't one of a paedophile because paedophiles are obviously horrible, violent and abusive people. He isn't horrible or violent. He cares for me. He buys me things. He gives me the security I so desperately need. Also, he's older and that's cool. He drives, has his own house, has a job, has money and all this freedom. \n\nMy friends knew about him and again, they all thought the idea of an older man was so cool. I got lucky. My friends were also abused by paedophiles. One of my friends got pregnant at 15 by a 30 year old man. She's now traumatised for life. I was trapped in this teenage girl circle where we all encouraged and enabled each other to be abused. I even introduced some of my innocent friends to his paedophile friends and for that I feel so guilty and ashamed. \n\nI often think about what is still out there on the dark web of me. He took many photos and videos of me in underwear, naked, masturbating, performing sex acts from the age of 13 until I was about 16. Things like this do not disappear from the internet. That content is most likely still being shared and used. It makes me feel sick and furious. \n\nWhen I turned about 16, his communication and attention starting getting less and less and I couldn't understand why. I felt so hurt. Then I had a sudden realisation that I was too old for him. It wasn't until I got my first consensual boyfriend who was the same age of me that I realised the situation was fucked up. I realised I had been used and abused and now disposed of. At 16, I was too old for a 27 year old man. That's fucked up. \n\nThat's when the fear kicked in. It kicked in for him too. He now knew that I knew it was wrong. I would often take trips into the nearest city (which was the nearest city for him too) and he would send me messages, saying he could see me, that he will follow me. It sent me into a hole of severe anxiety, panic attacks and for several years after, I spent it constantly looking over my shoulder. Even a 'small' incident of street harassment/cat-calling would send me spiralling. I couldn't deal with any of it. \n\nSo please, if you're a teenage girl reading this, don't fall for it. Please. If you're vulnerable and going through a bad time, there's alternatives to getting involved with a much older man. They won't save you. There's absolutely no reason for an older man to be in any sort of contact with you (but for family member/teacher). Nothing. They'll give you some bullshit that women their age are boring/nagging/not attractive. That's misogyny. I thought I was so mature at 16, I thought I knew and had experienced everything and felt like I could handle the world. Looking back now, there's so much you haven't yet dealt with/experienced/learned a lesson about. Without sounding patronising, you know so little and can handle so little. Please, don't give yourself the added and very unnecessary trauma of being abused by a paedophile. Life is hard enough as it is. \n\nProtect yourself and protect your friends. Call it for what it is and help them see the truth. Tell an adult what is going on.",

    "text": "I thought it was finally going to be different. I started working when I was 15 at a KFC. The shift manager there was a 20-something good looking guy. He constantly would pick me up at work. Throw me over his shoulder and put me places. In the trash can, on a shelf, in the freezer. He thought it was funny. I could not out strength him and it terrified me. I asked him not to. I cried. I went to our manager and asked her to do something about it. She told me, “oh he doesn’t mean anything by it” and my hours got cut. \nAfter a few months I got a new job at a pet store and aside from the constant creepy comments from customers everything seemed to be better. Until the assistant manager broke up with his girlfriend who was a shift manager at the same location. He started making comments about my appearance and inviting me to hang out while she was standing there. After very awkwardly turning down advance after advance I got moved to another department where I had a similar situation with a stocker. His girlfriend was pregnant and he wasn’t getting the attention he wanted at home. Because these two people were full time employees and I was not.... my hours got cut when I complained to my manager. \n\nThroughout college (for game design) I was often the only female or one of maybe 3 in a classroom. We often sat through lectures on how sex sells and how to make the characters more appealing. Characters who were badass and not scantily clad were not often welcomed in my classes and often we were marked down for design not being appealing. There are plenty of comments as well that went along with that by the men in my classes too. At one point the teacher had  requested to make a realistic model they would use someone from the class to take photos of and make the 3D model off of those photos. Every bit of my curves good and bad got to be scrutinized and and criticized up on the projector while the instructor modelled me. I got to watch them flatten my tummy more, make my breasts larger and my waist smaller in front of my peers. \n\nWhile in college I worked at a GameStop for awhile. Week after week I was the best numbers and sales for the store and district. I got promoted to a shift manager. On one Sunday I was working with another shift manager and he slapped my butt right on camera. When I reported it to the district manager he saw it happen on camera and he transferred me to a store 30-minutes away. \n\nSometime over the next year I had gotten promoted again to assistant store manager and had just interviewed for a store manager position. The district manager called me to tell me I didn’t get it because that store needed to be run by a man. \n\nAfter my career changed to Apple I thought I was going to be okay. They’re inclusive and ground breaking and and and and the same as everyone else.  I turned down a much older man who happened to be friends with my manager. In fact I turned him down many times. After reporting it to my manager and to HR I stopped being allowed to participate in rotation opportunities. I stopped being permitted to interview for other roles. All of that in spite of the fact I was one of the top 10% of sales numbers every year for the 7 I worked there. This went on for three years. That older man stalked me. He harassed me. He sent me photos and packages and stalked me everywhere. HR wouldn’t do anything for 3 years. 3 years of me begging for help and being denied movement in my role because I turned down a man 15-years my senior and his friend was my manager. I didn’t want to be involved in drama or harassment but I was labeled a trouble maker and “negative”. No one wanted me on their team. \nI went back to school for software development and I said to myself, “this time will be different” \n\nThere’s a guy at work who is very rude and talks awful to me he says very mean and hurtful things and when I reported it to my manager... I was told\n“Females are just too emotional. “ and to imagine he puts a “lol” or smiley after his comments. \n\nIt thought it would be different. I thought hard work would equate to a better role, higher pay, advancement.  I thought I was deserving of respect, that no meant no, and that it was okay to say no. I thought I had bodily autonomy. I was wrong. \n\nThis time was not different. \n\nI don’t know if it ever will be.",

    "text": "Everyday I am reminded of my feminist teacher who was demonized by all the boys in English Class Back in highschool I had a teacher in English whom all the boys labeled as \"sexist,\" \"a demon\" literally even \"a witch.\"\n\nWhy was she be labeled as such?\n\nWell for one thing, she was known for being a tough grader, and all the kids who were used to high grades were now suddenly getting B's and C's. All of them were extremely high achievers and blamed our Miss Teacher for just doing her job. HOWEVER, a lot of the times during discussions, Miss Teacher would try to get girls in the class to participate because mostly the boys would be doing all the talking. She would frequently correct the girls when they tried to downplay themselves by saying \"I might be wrong on this\" or \"I think it's,\" or \" I'm not sure if this is correct but\" when they mentioned their own views and answers,  and instead made themselves answer in a more confident manner. \n\nAll the boys accused Miss Teacher of playing favorites towards the girls when literally all she was trying to do was to encourage them and have a voice for themselves. I of course quietly sided with the boys because I was definitely a pick me girl at the time. Miss Teacher also joked about how society was super misogynistic and I think some parts of what she said might have made the boys uncomfortable because they identified themselves as part of the problem in perpetuating misogyny and the patriarchy.\n\nA lot of people (behind her back) would label her as extreme and a man hater, and only a few students were okay with her. When she got super sick, a lot of the students (mainly the guys) celebrated. Miss Teacher of course knew how the students felt about her and even mentioned that she heard a few students wanted to \"burn the witch\" and \"celebrate her funeral\". I don't know how she's doing right now but I hope she gets better. \n\nEveryday when I immerse myself with feminist literature and taking a stab at misogyny, I always think about Miss Teacher.

    "text": "Just wanted to share my great news with someone: after years of endometriosis pain I finally got my hysterectomy! I’m recovering right now and it’s just settling in how much better I’m going to feel and I wanted to share with how I got here. I had to fight tooth and nail to get here and it’s been a long time coming. Diagnosed with endo and PCOS in 2011. Never wanted kids but they kept telling me I had to wait til I was older to get a hysterectomy because I might change my mind. I didn’t like that but I kind of understood it. It’s a huge life altering decision and you’ve got to make sure it’s what you want. I am not the same person at 33 as I was at 23 (thank god). I occasionally waffled about having kids but only fostering/adopting. Never once have I wanted to push one out. \n\nI’ve had six surgeries to remove endometriosis. Found a doctor here in Orlando who changed my life and did a different kind of surgery (excision) which meant I could stop having those yearly surgeries. When I hit 30s and my pain was coming back she said yeah it’s time for the hysterectomy. All my other options were just as likely to increase my pain as decrease it. \n\nBut she doesn’t do hysterectomies, so I had to see someone else. The lady she wanted me to go to didn’t take my insurance so I had to see someone else.\nGuys... this doctor was the most sexist asshole. Told me I wasn’t old enough to make a decision about kids yet. I’M 33!!!! I straight up asked him if I said I wanted to get pregnant would he tell me I wasn’t old enough to decide and he LAUGHED and said “of course not.” Of course not. Of COURSE not. I left mid appointment which I’ve never done before because I was tired of arguing and didn’t want him digging around in my insides by that point anyway.\n\nSo here’s what I did. I’ve been with my boyfriend six years by that point. We were planning on getting married but like whatever we’ll get to it later. He’s an engineer and had great insurance while I’m a teacher and .... not great insurance. So we got a domestic partnership which allowed me to get on his insurance which allowed me to see the original doctor. That’s what I had to do to get this surgery which is ridiculous. I love my partner but it’s beyond irritating that I had to tie myself to a man to be able to get rid of my uterus. \n\nBut at least I finally got it. I’m in pain now but it’s so worth it. I hopefully won’t be crying during sex anymore - maybe I could actually even enjoy it?? Crazy. (Guys, find a man that not only stops during sex the second you start crying but will stop before you start crying because he senses your body tense from pain.  Seems like a given but it’s super not. Pro tip: we’re supposed to like sex, too) No more periods that send me to bed for three days with a heating pad crying. No more endless surgery on a body part I didn’t even want. \n\nDisclaimer, however - this doesn’t necessarily mean my endometriosis is gone for my fellow endo ladies. Sometimes a hysterectomy is touted as a cure-all for endo and it’s not but can definitely be a life changer for many endo sufferers. Just want to throw that out there.\n\nTL;DR: Uterus got evicted for failure to not be an asshole and I’m super happy about it",

    "text": "I am so sick of people putting all blame on the mother when it comes to difficult family situations! First off all I (F24)am not a mother but my sister(28) is a mother of four and the things she is being put through that I have  witnessed just grind my gears! \n\nFor context my sister is currently in the process of getting out of a toxic relationship. It's  messy and a slow process.  But the abridged version is,  she got married to a guy from a very religious  household who pressured her into becoming  a mother early and kept pressuring her for more kids. Her (still)husband still wants more kids but doesn't care for the already born ones (for him caring for children boils down to scream at them till they finally  do as he says). Result  is that the oldest two show early signs of childhood trauma,  social services are involved and my sister is struggling to build an independent existence so she can get a divorce. \n\nWhat just ticks me off is that everyone expects her to pull the whole stunt off. \n\nThe flat  looks like a dumpster and the husband doesn't  leave enough money for food in the bank account?  Well she  needs to manage the household better.  She is the problem because she is an unfit mother. It's not the husband that spends money on unnecessary stuff and locks the goverment child support  money from her for his expenses. It's her the mother being lazy for not getting the dishes done while caring for four children all under the age of 7 not him sleeping or gaming most of the time. \n\nThe child shows signs of mental trauma and is already seeing a child psychiatrist and talking to social services but still makes trouble in school?  Well she the mother gets belittled by the teacher and principal even tho they are fully aware of the family situation and give the father a pass for being the \"bread-winner\". My sister holds down two jobs and is building her own bussines  but the man with one job and three days off of work a week that he spends gaming or drinking with friends is good to go.It's the mother that is soley  responsible for the bad behavior. \n\nOn regular check up visits with social workers she got told  that : \n1. She needs to renovate  the flat \n2. Her renovations  she did all on her own in one week aren't good enough \n3. She should ignore her diploma in agriculture economics and stop persuing  building her own bussines because \"she needs to acknowledge the insecurities of her husband\"\n4. She needs to be more understanding  for the needs of her husband\n5. She needs to stay with her husband for the kids sake\n6. She should just leave the kids with our mother or me not even acknowledging that our mother as well as I have seperat lifes and our own occupations and in the case of me even live a 45 minute drive  away. \n7. She needs to sell her bussines assets (livestock and horses)  while her husband has multiple unused cars and other motorized expensive  and unused equipment as well as tons of limit edition gameing equipment and fanmerch that could be liquidated and that the kids aren't emotionally  attached to. \n8. The fact that she gets help from other women for cleaning  and cooking is making er less of a mother figure. \n\nIn no moment  was it ever acknowledge that the husband is also a factor  in the equation. His behavior which in parts actively prevents my sister  from fulfilling the demands the social services have for her is completely excused  and socially acceptable. It is the mother she has to make everything right! \n\nThe expectations society  places on mothers just because they are mothers are just rediculous. It seems mothers are expected to just strip themselves of all rights of individuality and become solely responsible  for the kids even if a other parental figure  is involved. If mothers struggle,  they get blamed for struggling in the first  place. \n\nAs woman who doesn't  even want kids this just breaks my heart. Why can't we just give mothers a break and respect what they achieve and give them the support  they need?",

    "text": "I'm tired of us ignoring some of the genuine reasons many women get STIs that have nothing to do with being \"dumb\" or \"careless\" This is kind of a rant, but I'm seeing a pattern of STIs in women with male partners that I feel like we don't talk about or acknowledge.\n\nI work in sexual health. So I see a ton of people in my clinic with STIs. Many women with male sex partners do not come in with STIs bc the are \"careless\" or \"dumb\" or \"slutty\". In fact, women with a higher number of sexual partners, often take sexual health more seriously than others. Sex workers, highkey have the best safe sex practices.\n\nI feel like we are dishonest about what is really fueling so many of the STIs in women with male partners. SOOOO many of the women I see felt uncomfortable forcing a man to get an STI test before sleeping with him. Or they believed a man verbally saying he was tested, instead of demanding official paperwork (shocker some men lie about their results or when they got tested). some women were too scared or uncomfortable to demand a man use a condom.\n\n(I have literally had to teach teen girls how to say no to men who refuse to use condoms because none of their sex-ed teachers ever bothered to mention that critical aspect of sexual health to them.)\n\nThe vast majority of my HIV positive women I see got it from a monogamous partner who either cheated on them or withheld their HIV positive status from them.  I just had a woman get HIV from the only man she'd been with for the past five years and I just feel bad because she did nothing wrong and it never occurred to her she'd be at risk - but women in monogamous relationships still have STI risks. I've seen married women discover they had an STI because they were struggling with getting pregnant, but hadn't got an STI test since the start of their relationship, and their male partner had unfortunately been unfaithful to them at some point. (Fun fact some STIs are silent killers, you can't necessarily \"feel\" every STI)\n\nI feel like we just tell women \"use condoms\" and \"get tested\" for safe sex, but that's literally scratching the surface because it doesn't acknowledge many of the genuine cases that cause so many women to not feel educated  or strong or confident or comfortable enough to press for safe sex in risky situations. \n\nWhy aren't we teaching hetero women how to say no to men who refuse to use condoms? To say no to men who refuse to get up-to-date STI testing (no a test from 6 months isn't good enough)? That's its not being untrusting to demand to see STI results in official paperwork and not accept word of mouth? To know that sadly infidelity happens so even in monogamous relationships/marriage you still need to get STI tested yearly with your doctor? To tell their male partners that if they ever are unfaithful to tell you ASAP to get tested to prevent possible health risks? \n\nI just feel like we aren't being honest about the education and empowerment needed to actually help women practice safer sex - because giving free condoms is not enough to stop women from getting STIs.\n\nP.S. I'm not trying to be heternormative, it's just the vast majority of women I see with STIs are having sex with men",

    "text": "(TW) I was sexually harassed at church. In front of my family. They did nothing. Title says it all, really.\n\nFor about four years, I was frequently harassed by an old man in my church. It started when I was 13, ended when I was 17. He was well into his 70s, 80-something (I think) when he passed.\n\nMr. G would put his arm around me and tug me right up against his side. He'd tell me to smile, and wouldn't let go until I did so. And it couldn't be a little closed-mouth smile either, it had to be full with teeth. He'd kiss me on the head or cheek even when I moved my head away, and one specific comment from him sticks in my head to this day:\n\n*\"You're so pretty, I just wanna take ya home and keep ya in a vase!\"*\n\nAnd like the title says, he did this in front of my family. My mother would ignore it entirely. My dad would threaten to beat up the man, but then they'd both just chuckle at each other while I wanted to just disappear. And my sister readily laughed at me--because she said it was funny how uncomfortable I was. I told my family multiple times, very explicitly, that I hated it. I hated him. I told them, word-for-word, that he made me deeply uncomfortable.\n\n\"There's nothing to be uncomfortable about,\" said Dad. \"He's a harmless old man, just messing with you. Just humor him.\"\n\nSister would smirk. \"I know, that's why it's funny.\"\n\nMom just shrugged a little and went, \"Well...\"\n\nI was 16 when I confessed to one of my teachers that I was having these experiences. She seemed perturbed, but never did anything.\n\nI stopped going to church for years, only making an obligatory appearance for things like Easter or Christmas. Mr. G died when I was 23. I went to his funeral, and everyone talked about what a great guy he was. How he'd served in the military, and later as a detective. He worked on the Charles Manson case. He was a hero, back in his day.\n\nI sat there at that funeral, feeling nothing. Not even relief.\n\n... And that was the worst of it. Another man from the church, much more recently (threeish years ago), made a sexual joke about me. Once again, in front of my family. And they still didn't do or say anything in my defense.\n\nDad and Mr. M go way back. They would always briefly chat after service and joke around. I was in college at the time, visiting home over break. Mr. M asked if I was heading back to school later that day, which I was. I followed with a comment that I couldn't wait to graduate. Then Mr. M replied:\n\n*\"I wouldn't be surprised if as soon as you do, we'll hear the pitter-pat of little feet!\"*\n\n... Yeah, he suggested that I was gonna get pregnant at school and come back with a baby. Because nothing says 'Good Christian Man'  like making jokes about your friend's daughter's sex life. At church. In front of family. I didn't even say anything back as he laughed at his own joke--and then laughed at my lack of a reaction. Family were totally silent. He moved away last year and I don't miss him, either. Good riddance.\n\nAll these years later, I still have a poor view of the church and religion in general.",

    "text": "Reported what feels like a very unsafe situation to my college today; was informed that transparency is more important than my safety. My self and another women in my program have been dealing with some pretty intense harassment from a male student for the entire school year. It's always made me uncomfortable, but in the past month it has moved well past that and officially into the realm of feeling unsafe both on and off campus. \n\nThis male student has become erratic, confrontational, and increasingly unpredictable; as well as going out of his way to tell other males in the program how much he dislikes and distrusts women. There are only two female students and one female teacher in my program, and each of us have come forward to say that he makes us feel unsafe. \n\nAfter spending over an hour explaining how this is not only making me feel like I am in physical danger, but also taking a heavy toll on my educational career I asked how the situation was going to be handled moving forward. I was shocked to learn that none of our identities will be protected in anyway when the man is confronted- apparently our safety is not as important as this being handled \"fairly and transparently\". So if he asks who reported him, they will just give him our names... Not that it would have been hard to guess as there's only 3 women in the program, but what the fuck?!?\n\nSo basically my choices are:\n\n1. Continue to be harassed by someone who doesn't even treat me like a person while my grades slowly deteriorate as I am so uncomfortable I can't even focus, let alone learn.\n\nOr...\n\n2. Have my name given to an unstable man (who I am physically afraid of) as the person who reported him while he is being informed that he's being suspended or expelled from school for gender-based harassment.\n\n\nThis sucks. I love my field of study; it's a very niche program and one of only a couple in the country so it's not like I can continue this with out relocating (not an option for me). I'm a straight A student and have an awesome internship lined up for this summer as well as a exciting future to look forward to. I feel like my education is being put on the line just so some asshole can continue to treat me like shit everyday.\n\nI have talked with the other woman and we have decided if the school refuses to protect our identities or try to keep us safe we will be calling the police to get a no contact order. I will literally have an officer come onto campus and present the order to admissions if I have to. \n\nI'm fluctuating between being so angry I could scream and so sad I want to cry. I don't feel like I should be forced to make the choice between my future or my safety, but it seems I have no other options. It seems to me that my school either doesn't believe it's us, or doesn't care what happens to us... I hate this. \n\nAm I crazy for thinking I deserve to be able to learn in a non-threatening environment without being outed for filing a report against my harasser? Is it unreasonable to expect my school to protect me from a potentially dangerous situation?\n\nEDIT: I posted this before I went to bed last night, waking up to this many people confirming what I was already feeling has convinced me that I just need to file a restraining order. I'm going to take with the other person involved and take care of this. Thank you for helping me. I'll update as I go.",

    "text": "\"I saw your husband cleaning. He must be a good man.\" Really? Last night My husband and I had yet another heated discussion. We tried to talk about our issues with our difference in expectations for our children. Our kids are still young 7 and 9, and the 7 year old is autistic. He considers himself a strict, structured, authoritarian who is very tidy. My perspective is, there is another side to that coin-He is rude, aggressive, high maintenance, with too high standards for other people, and doesn't see his own piles of mess in the house.\n\nDuring our discussion yesterday, I asked him as I gestured around to our tidied house with a recently swept and mopped floor and asked as neutrally as I could \"What in this room is a pig sty to you?\" (he used the words pig sty and slobs).  He gestured to 4 snowflakes sitting in front of his pile of electronics that he leaves spread all over the dining room table every day. \"Our seven year old made me these 4 days ago, and they have just sat here. She gave them to me as a gift, but I don't want it. Its trash. So, now I'm expected to take care of it and throw it in the trash for her. She expects me to clean up after her.\"\n\nI could go on with examples like that. Where he has a point, but his perspective, attitudes, and standards are pretty ridiculous. But this post isn't about our fight.\n\nI am teaching high school to special needs kids 8-3:20 every weekday. A few days ago, my husband was seen in the background doing dishes. Since instruction was being led by the other teacher that hour, my mic was muted. He was swearing and grumbling the entire time, loudly clanking dishes. After the kids went on break, the other teacher commented how lucky I am to have a husband that cleans, and what a good man he must be.\n\nSeriously? Witnessing a man doing the dishes once makes him so good, and I'm so lucky? This man who rages at paper snowflakes, having to ask twice, and the quality of cleaning from an autistic seven year old. When he does clean, he slams cupboards, and grumbles and curses. But because he is male and doing dishes, he is a damn saint.\n\nHis cleaning habits/expectations/demands are probably one of the worst aspects of his personality. He walks in the house, and everyone immediately gets this sense of dread that hes going to go into one of his temper tantrums over a puzzle on the couch, or an apple core and 3 pieces of paper on a desk. We occasionally go on red alert when we know hes coming home, and whirlwind around the house making sure all the little things from our day is picked up. And half the time we do that, he throws a passive aggressive hissy fit about something we missed. Hes no fucking saint for cleaning. Hes just male.",

This is a story about being humbled.\n\nWhen I arrived to see this man, I could quickly tell he had many wounds/scabs on his body that didn't seem to be healing. (Just my assessment, not medical staff, just a chaplain) - we began to talk and after a bit, he told me how hungry he was and that he was homeless, down on his luck. He spoke in a low and defeated tone. He just wanted a sandwich. I helped him out.\n\nI came back to my office after that visit, looking at his chart, and saw that he had complaints of worms in his wounds/stool, extreme amounts of pus, and a few other things that aren't very pleasant. I immediately became frustrated that I had shaken his hand and spent time with him in close proximity. \n\nAs I sat there washing my wands for the 3rd time and wiping down my computer and office, it hit me. I and the other members of the hospital team caring for him might have been the closest human contact he's had in a while.\n\nI imagine he's outcasted, at least by most of society. In a moment of self-realization, I was humbled and convicted. As someone who is religious, I often think about Jesus. I remember stories of Jesus being with lepers. Choosing to enter into people's unpleasantness to love them. This man was a modern-day leper. To love is to see someone as more than their worst qualities. I did not initially do that.\n\nI judged this man and thought I knew him when I was with him. But I didn't know. I saw him as a homeless man who needed help. I didn't see him as a dad or a son. A person who feels pain every time someone looks at him in disgust. Insecure about his wounds. Longing for the affection many of us take for granted. \n\nI don't know why he is where he is, if it's his fault or not. But I know he's a person just like me. With a heart.

I'm currently taking my last 3 needed prerequisites for dental hygiene, after being a habitual college dropout for almost 8 years now. I'm leaning into going into nursing rather than dental hygiene, and these 3 classes are still needed to apply to the program. I always leave college because I dont want to do one thing for the rest of my life. I'm more of a \"jack of all trades\" type of person. I'm very good at a lot of things but a master of none. Im 26, married with 2 children and really still don't know what I want to be when I grow up. \n\nI'm in A&P 1, Chemistry 101 and a film class to fill up my schedule. I have no confidence in Chemistry. I'm great with numbers, I have been a math tutor for almost 10 years and love math. But chemistry makes no sense to me. The math part is easy, its more so memorizing formulas and the way my professor teaches is very confusing, he talks in circles and advised AGAINST us buying the book. \"I will teach you everything you need to know\", were his exact words. But he's not a good teacher. Smart man, great chemist, bad teacher. \nAny words of encouragement? Or study tips for this? I really want to overcome this class. \n\nAlso, would you rather do dental hygiene or nursing? I am personally choosing DH simply for the scheduling flexibility with 2 school-aged kiddos. And to make a decent living. Very few nurses get to work those types of hours but there is very little room for advancement as a dental hygienist. I feel a lot of pressure to go into nursing also. My mom is a nurse, one of my sisters is a nurse and my other sister is a pediatrician. I am the black sheep, artsy/dreamer, hippie, in the family. I know I am smart, but school has never been my thing. But I know I need to grow up and be something. Also, my mom is sort of a dream killer so that's why I feel all of her children are in the medical field. Every dream or passion I told her I wanted to pursue as a child even into adulthood, her response was \"you won't make any money doing that.\" Now in the day of technology and social media, literally every career I showed interest in as a child/teen is making decent money. I just feel like I'm too old to pursue them at this point and I need to provide for my family.",

    "text": "A student was being forced to cut her hair. I did something to show some kind of support, and the outcome was WOW! A rather long story, but I really need to shout this out.\n\nSo, the 9th grader in question (I'll call her G) identifies as female, has asked us to use she/her pronouns, and wears her hair long, always in a dainty plait or ponytail. She once told me that she had been growing it since 6th grade and taking good care of it because it made her transition easier. G's parents are aware of her situation and fully support her.\n\nMost of the staff either have no problem with this or we keep our opinions to ourselves and comply with the name change, pronouns, etc... That is, everyone except her Social Studies teacher, Mrs T.\n\nFrom Day 1, Mrs T has refused to change pronouns with G, deadnames her, has told her several times that she needs to \"act/dress like a man\", and often mentions her hair is too long. Mrs T has been teaching at the school since its inception and is close friends with the Assistant Principal... So, yup, a bit of seniority leverage comes at play...\n\nA few weeks ago, G came to me (I'm the tutor of her class) to tell me that Mrs T and AP had given her an ultimatum - either she had her hair cut by the end of the week, or she would get a suspension.\n\nSince G was visibly troubled and she's a nice teen, I got a copy of the school's regulations and gave it a read to see if I could help. I did find a few sentences that mentioned hairstyles but they only stated, quote, \"*Students' hair must be kept away from their faces at all times. Unruly or uncombed hair is not permitted. Hair is not to be worn any shorter than a Number 3 cut*.\"\n\nAs you can imagine, G was in fact following the rules, so I told her to get a copy of the regulations and plead her case directly with Assistant P. She did, and everything seemed okay...\n\nLast Friday, however, G broke down in tears in the middle of the lesson. While Assistant P had initially agreed that she was following the rules, she had told her that morning that her hair \"wasn't appropriate\" and she had to cut it by next Wednesday. AP even mentioned the possibility of changing the regulations to make sure she complied.\n\nThe class was in disbelief, and I felt mad. Went to talk with AP and argued for G's case, but I would've had better luck reasoning with a wall. Then, an idea - I texted my Principal (he was away for a regional meeting) to ask whether the staff had any regulations on hairstyles. He said of course not, there were no regulations. Great, that's all I needed to know...\n\nMonday morning, I walked through the halls showing off a very short pixie - short enough to still be considered professional, yet a far cry from my trademark long curls.\n\nMrs T went pale as a sheet when she saw me and my 9th graders were aghast when I entered the classroom, but ended up cheering. I got a tearful hug from G before we started the lesson.\n\nA few hours later, the Principal knocked on my door and asked if we could talk outside. He told me Mrs T had entered his office in quite a state and said something about me stirring up trouble and setting a bad example. What was that about, something to do with my new hairstyle?\n\nI told him I thought he was aware of what happened with G last week. Nope, he said. I explained the whole thing, finishing with a firm, \"You can fire me right now if you think I crossed a line\". He belly laughed and called me a firecracker before sending me back to my lesson. Mrs T and AP were called to his office during the day and, before we left, staff received a Whatsapp from him.\n\nIn short:\n\n* School regulations must be followed to a T, but so far there's no distinction between male and female hairstyles and there won't be.\n* Starting tomorrow, all 9th-grade teachers and classmates must use G's chosen name and she/her pronouns at all times.\n* Discrimination of any kind, against staff members or students, will have severe consequences.\n\nDid I play with fire? Maybe.\n\nWas it worth it? ***Absofreakinglutely***.\n\n\\--------  \nEDIT: Holy... Wow. Guys, thank you very much for all your kind words and support for G, for sharing perspectives, awards, for taking the time to read.\n\nAnd you honestly have no idea how much it means to me when someone goes out of their way to praise something I did. Truly, you can't imagine. I'm freaking crying. I really hope I can become a better teacher and person with this boost, so THANK YOU.\n\nLet's all keep up the good work!",

    "text": "The best two lessons I was ever taught So I had a student teacher in fourth grade who gave us two “non standard” lessons that stick with me to this day.\n\n\n\nThe first was that he gave us a math test that was far above our level, and called for us to hand it in 5 minutes later. The instructions on the test were to only do the two easy questions on the back.\n\nThis taught me to always take the extra few seconds to read the instructions.\n\n\n\n\nThe second thing he did was he pretended to be a Martian, and on Mars they only eat sloppy Joe’s that come straight from the motion sensor tap, and we had to verbally walk him through making a PB&J sandwich. \n\nHe would deliberately misinterpret our instructions, hitting the jar of PB, against the table when we said to “open the jelly”, or twisting the wrong end of the jar the wrong way when we said to twist the top off.\n\n\nThis taught me how to make clear and concise instructions and it has been a boon in my life so far whenever I want to get a point across too.\n\n\n\n\nThat is all.\n\n\n\nIf you’re reading this mr anonymous teacher man, you rocked!",

    "text": "Every Teacher is an Actor First year teacher here. I'm now thoroughly convinced that every teacher is an actor. As a first year I assumed that knowing what to do would come with years of experience. This doesn't seem to be the case. Everyone puts on a show. We all act like we know what we're doing when in reality, everyone makes everything up. \n\nMy mom occasionally comes in to volunteer in my classroom. I was talking to her while my students were doing a quick brain break and almost began crying. The brain break ended and I put on my teacher face and went right back into teaching the content. My mom later commented that it was weird to see me flip like that. Going from one extreme emotion to just acting like everything is fine. I realize that I am now the actor. I wonder if my teachers often felt the same way.\n\nOn the surface, everyone seems to have their shit together. When I ask how they felt their first few years they all tell me that they had no idea what they were doing. Then they tell me I work too hard. I feel like I do the bare minimum to survive at this point. I read the curriculum every night and prepare the next days activities and they tell me that that's doing too much. Even though they all did that when they first began too. You have to. Otherwise, how would you survive?\n\nI honestly feel like teaching is some made up thing. People put on a show all day long (in front of the kids, in front of colleagues, in front of parents). I'm convinced that no one really knows what they're doing ( 100% of the time) and that everyone just does what works best for them (which isn't a bad thing, I just find it hard to grapple with the fact that I have to try out a whole bunch of things - fail - and then figure out what works for me. It's not concrete.). \n\nI just want to succeed. I want to have made an impact. I have no idea how to feel successful in this career.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nEdit:\n\nI just want to clarify that I like what I do, for the most part. In this post I was making an observation about the world of teaching. \n\nYes, we teach the standards and curriculum. I read curriculum every night. I'm not \"faking\"/\"making\" that part up. However, there are a million parts of teaching that do not have to do with the curriculum (that you also can not thoroughly prepare yourself for before you do it - I know college didn't prepare me). Some things that come to mind are: classroom management, student behavior, meetings, parents, etc. I know I'll get better with \"knowing\" what to do over time, and it won't feel as foreign to me.\n\nOf course I put on a one man show for my students every day. What I feel like is really odd about this profession is how everyone seems to be excelling on the outside but secretly breaking down on the inside. For example, there's another new teacher at my school. I reached out to him to voice what I'm struggling with. He told me that it seemed like I was doing really well and he had no idea that I felt the way I did. He told me his struggles too, and if I hadn't reached out to him I would've thought that he was having no issues at all.\n\nNot only are teachers acting for their students, they're also acting in front of each other (when no students are present)! \n\nI'm not saying that other professions or adults in general don't act. What I am saying is that I feel like it's amplified in this profession.",

    "text": "What Not To Do At An Interview Pt. 1 So I have been busy all week interviewing candidates for a few vacancies we have for the 2021/2022 school year. Yesterday was not a great day to interview candidates. I had two candidates in a row for the science position we have that were just....... bad at interviewing. I will describe the first one now. Let me explain how the interview process works in my district. \n\nCandidates apply to the school district via the district website. Those candidates applications are then sorted into what positions they are applying for and what they are also qualified to teach. the district then gives us a list with their stats and we schedule interviews with candidates we are interested in. I meet with the candidate for 5 minutes before the interview begins to make sure information is correct and to just chat with them. If there are no red flags, they meet with myself, the principal, and a member of the department they are applying to work in (Science, Math, P.E., ect..) If we like them, we let HR know and they make the candidate an offer. \n\nThe first candidate I had yesterday for the post was a young man who we will call Abe. Abe is a 24 year old man who has a degree in biology and would need an emergency certification if hired. Not uncommon when you have a position that is hard to fill. Abe showed up onetime and dressed in a polo shirt, brown slacks, and a pair of tennis shoes. I spoke with Abe in my office and I asked him the questions I often do of teachers who are new to the career field. When I asked him \"Why do you want to be a teacher here?\" he gave me an honest answer, but still a terrible answer. I shit you not, here is how this part of the conversation went:\n\nHonest Abe: Oh, I don't want to be a teacher.\n\nMe: What?\n\nHonest Abe: I don't want to be a teacher. I just need a job for a few months until my Master's program begins.\n\nMe: This position is a full time teaching position. It is from August till May. \n\nHonest Abe: Oh I know. But I just want to teach a few classes a day until December. \n\nMe: Ok, that is not going to happen. I need a full time teacher that will complete the school year. I can't hire someone part time to work for only a few months. Sorry.\n\nHonest Abe: So are we going to meet with the principal now? \n\nMe: No. You just told me that you don't want to be a teacher and that you can't complete the school year. \n\nHonest Abe: Can we just forget I said that stuff and meet with the principal?\n\nMe: No. No we can't just forget it. I am not going to hire someone who doesn't want to be a teacher and can't finish their contract. I'll show you out.\n\nHonest Abe: Please. I need a job. \n\nMe: This is a teaching position, not fast food. Good luck in you job search and your Master's program.\n\nI then walked him out and let the principal know why I cancelled the interview. I also let HR know. Just a bit of advice to any new teachers. \n\nDon't tell the interviewer that you don't want to be a teacher or that you plan to quit before the year ends. It won't work out for anyone.",

    "text": "I Threw Away My Xanax I am a very fortunate human being in that I was born without any mental health issues to speak of, which is to say naturally and without outside cause, I don't suffer from depression or anxiety. It's now been two years since I left teaching. Today I was cleaning out my bathroom closet and found the Xanax I was prescribed back in the days when I would cry multiple times a day, get yelled at by admins, get verbally and physically assaulted by the kids, get called a \"bitch\" several times an hour, start trembling as I got in my car to drive to work every morning, got gaslit by a toxic principal who would literally witness a student insult me and then genuinely say \"he didn't say that\" when I asked for disciplinary actions, hear literal little boys say sexually explicit things about me well aware that I could hear every word, got a black eye from a student, lost a great relationship because I would spend every weekend in a Xanax and wine haze just to suppress my deep emotional pain and trauma, and basically live like a depressed, anxious and ill person who barely washed her dishes and spent all non-working moments on the couch staring at Netflix and not even really watching it and who'd quit all her fitness pursuits and personal hobbies.\n\nAfter the black eye incident I left and never came back. I moved in with my parents. At first I was still taking the Xanax to deal withe the PTSD of it all and the feeling of being an utter failure for living with mommy and daddy as an adult. But then when the pandemic happened and we went into lockdown, I started to know more people who moved back home, so the shame I felt dissipated. \n\nAs the months progressed, I started to feel like my old self again. I dove into self-care and became the queen of home workouts, hobbies, meditation and journaling. I applied to nursing school - stress I can handle, abuse I cannot - and am loving my studies and the friends I've made, which include two former teachers who share my story. I decided to say \"fuck it\" completely to *any* societal stigmas about living at home and have been loving spending time with my folks and my teenage brother, who turns out is an incredibly intelligent and thoughtful young man, and I almost missed his adolescence completely because I never socialized while trapped in an abusive job. I got to get my teaching kicks by helping him during the pandemic and I think having his own personal tutor will do wonders to ensure that he's academically thriving come college. (Also his sweet little romance with his adorable girlfriend is my own personal \"Riverdale.\" Their occasional mini breakups are hilariously melodramatic, as teenage love tends to be.)\n\nToday I found a half-full Xanax bottle, with my name and a 2019 date, and I threw it in the trash. I don't need it medically, and I don't want to take it recreationally.\n\nI don't know who in the thick of it needs to hear this today, but you don't have to live like an abuse victim under the guise of a career. You don't have to put the needs of the three \"good kids\" in your room over your own personal mental health. You don't have to spend every day in a never-ending panic attack. There's another life waiting for you and there's no chain holding you to that desk.",

    "text": "Should I call my boss out? Hi,\n\nFirstly let me apologise if this is the wrong sub for this. I had a meeting today which has really bothered me. At around lunch time I was asked to meet with my boss and a member of the HR department about some work I had recently completed. \n\nI work for a subcontractor to the education sector and we get asked to create specific content for teachers to use. I had been asked to make a guide on using a certain program and had done so with the mind of producing this for teachers. However, my colleague who is at the same level as me but whom I was working with on this task had intended this recourse to be used by students. This led to some confusion and the work I produced was not to the desired level. With this in mind my boss wanted to talk to me in a formal manner regarding expectations and the level of work we produce. \n\nHowever, I feel that this is too sever of a step and I feel that I have essentially been given a disciplinary over a miscommunication. I feel that this is completely one sided and that there were no clear expectations or examples given of what to produce. I also feel that I shouldn't be solely responsible for this and it is equally my colleagues fault for simply telling me to make a guide without specifying who for. Now i could live with this if we were both invited to a discussion and this was settled between us and our manager. However, I have been given sole responsibility for this mistake which cost a fair amount of man hours. I am debating handing my notice in over this and at the very least I feel that I should inform my manager of how frustrated I am with this.\n\nI'd like to hear your thoughts whatever they may be.",

    "text": "How to start over with a hands on career without having to start over financially? Degree suggestions that are hands on? This post is long as hell. Felt like venting my frustrations on Reddit today.\n\nWhen I was in my earlier 20's (I'm now 27 going on 28) I went ahead and got a Bachelor's in Ethnic Studies (don't ask why...I was younger and more naive when I was staring at a list of majors and as person of color, I thought it would be a \"cool\" fit. Not to mention, I wanted to be a teacher or pursue a masters in counseling at that time and that major gave me an upper hand). I felt the regret right after I received my diploma - which is why I didn't pursue teaching - I just knew I was trying to justify the degree.\n\nNot going to lie, some days I still like the idea of being a counselor, but I cannot get over the regret of not going into trades when I was younger and the thought of spending even more money on another degree to have the same regret has me thinking twice on that.\n\nI know I'm a hands on person that really enjoys fixing things and physically seeing work. In the past I've held jobs as a shop hand/material handling repairer and even had a gig manning an industrial coffee roaster and maintenance tech. Both of which have been my favorite positions.\n\nI recently had a \"big boy job\" working as a data analyst for a national grocery chain of all things. Totally unrelated to my degree and unrelated to my interests. It was mind numbing work, and quite sad to spend every day like that. The office culture wasn't my cup of tea, it just irked me. People complaining about the dumbest things all the time, terrible small talk and staring at the computer made the time go really slow. I know all jobs have their downs, but I could not stand the corporate culture one bit.\n\nI quit the job for an electrical apprenticeship position, (my dad is an electrician, so it has been a huge influence in my life that I can't avoid)  but had a voice in my head telling me I was too old to start over, mainly based off of the stigma that I should have my shit figured out by now. The thing is, I'm married and I have a baby on the way. My wife and I both want to buy a house, and going from a $50k salary to $16.00 hourly with no benefits just set us further back from achieving that goal. More importantly, I couldn't justify it with a baby on the way. We were both on employer provided insurance before I left and we then got approved for Medicaid.\n\nThe gig was hard work, but I enjoyed it. It was daunting that I had 4 years to get a Journeyman status and more schooling, but it was even more daunting to think about the pay cut, benefit loss and having to wait longer for a house.\n\nIt was short lived and I quit to take a job at a local hospital training people in medical software programs that they use in clinics. It's salaried, great benefits and all. Here I am again, knowing it's not my jam - not my cup of tea. I'm doing this for my wife and baby - as I should.\n\nAfter we are all settled in and reach some of our goals, I plan to explore career and school options and I really want to make the right choice. When I see trade workers I get envious and wish I was doing what they were doing. However, in the back of my mind I know that I can't just walk in as a 1st year apprentice and request $20+ an hour and I know we both can't really afford to take a pay cut to our household income if we want to buy a house and provide for the baby.\n\nUnless my wife makes bookoo bucks, the trades idea probably won't happen for me. My other option is to pursue further education in something hands on, though it won't be the same as a trade. I can't enlist in the military due to some medical disqualifications, so that's a scratch.  Anyone else have similar career paths/regrets/dreams/etc? Or general advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading this heap of hot poopy.",

    "text": "LONG. Can't find work even with good chances. Can anyone help me figure out how to stop my life crashing and burning? No TLDR sorry. It's just a long read from a relatively desperate man and I don't know how to be more succinct about my life's failures.\n\n~~Story:\nIt's hard to know where to begin. My parents \"raised me to be individual\" which is another way of saying that they provided zero guidance beyond \"school is important.\" That is not an exaggeration. My parents never gave me a sex talk, job talk, interview talk, or ANY talk for that matter. Literally. They fed me. Clothed me. Kept a nice house and generally put an emphasis on family. I felt loved. But short of that very important thing, I felt completely unprepared for adulthood. If I ever become a parent, I'm going to be much more hands on. Laissez faire is not a parenting strategy.\n\nI was a stellar Highschool student. Without much effort on my part I was able to easily attain a 4.0+ GPA with honors and AP classes. I was socially apt. I was a state champion in debate, a national semi-finalist in Student Congress, as well as a 4 time national qualifier for competitive political speech. I had racked up hundreds, possibly approaching thousands of hours of community service in high school to pad my resume; including teaming up with 4 other students to 100% plan, execute, and deliver unique service events. One event we even rallied in the local national guard to help host a Run-a-thon to raise money for a well-liked student who had been crippled by a degenerative disease. Raised thousands of dollars for her medical bills. Granted we did all this for ourselves. I don't claim to be altruistic, but the scale of accomplishments  completely outpaced anything else I had heard of students doing in our state. I was selected for multiple top % summer camps and programs. (not books they try to sell you, actual experiences where they try to bring in the top students). Honestly my resume applying for scholarships was something I was really proud of because I had done it all on my own, with no guidance from my parents. Unfortunately, the money didn't show. Probably should have been a red flag here.\n\nI was pushed into college since I was in 8th grade; it's what everyone was doing at least till the early 2000's (probably still are). My dad was a first gen college grad and it had provided a good life for him since the 70's. So I tailored my high school experience to get me there and that was the plan. I had been accepted into prestigious schools on account of my test scores and resume. In the end, I had no way to pay for it and no one ever offered my guidance about whether  it would be worth it to do whatever it took to pay for those schools. So I ended up going to the local state school because I had placed in the top 3 in their two largest scholarship programs which, while short of the full ride, had secured me 2 years of free college. In the end I would end up with over $50k in student debt and 15 years later I have never once been in a financial position to start making payments on it. I'm honestly extremely bitter about college all together. It's a burden I will likely shoulder until I die and as of yet have seen zero rewards from it.\n\nStarting college and all throughout I never had any clue about what kind of work I wanted to do, should do, or even had a chance of getting into. I went to college for the vague idea that I had to do it to \"get a good job\". After 5 years and several major changes in the business school, I walked into the counselor's office and asked them what degree would get me out the door fastest. Because the loans were piling up and I still felt like I had no path in front of me. I figured I needed to get work experience. That's the real world shit that people actually care about right? That's how I went from Entrepreneurship Major to Accounting Major to Engineering Major to finally...Marketing Major. I was one class short of the Marketing degree come the May graduation, but since it was an elective credit, I could take it over the summer and they would still let me walk the the grad ceremony beforehand. I just got an asterisk saying I had to complete the summer program. \n\nSo I walked the stage, got my papers and my entire family celebrated. My dad was proud. It's all he ever wanted for me. Somehow he just couldn't understand that I had just went $50k into debt but had absolutely no clue what I had purchased or how to use it. I went to guidance counselors and they made resumes with me. I was willing to take any job in any industry that would serve as a stepping stone to something better. But it was 2009 and the economy had just crashed so I found nothing. 2 years of searching, working a local sandwich shop, and watching my own peers decide it made more sense to go back to school for a Master's than continue to search for jobs. I took a slightly different route. I sold everything I owned and moved to the west coast from the midwest. Another year of searching for jobs out here yielded nothing better. I was told the economy was recovering and the job market was heating up. No one ever called me back for an interview. I began to get depressed. I felt worthless. Here I was this \"gifted\" student whose pedigree would make plenty of people jealous but no one cared. I had amounted to nothing. \n\nLuckily I was able to stay afloat the last decade because of a free state program sponsored by Boeing because they needed CNC operators. So I did a 6 month course for free at a local community college, sent out one resume after getting the certificate and 3 weeks later I was hired at $15/hr at a local shop that supplies Boeing with parts. 7 years there, the company promoted me multiple times, made me a lead, I managed dozens of employees working directly under the supervisor. I interviewed candidates. Made hiring decisions. Trained staff. Did disciplinary action. You name it. I managed. The company brought in an outside teacher to host a chosen few of us in Leadership classes, this lasted a few years. In the end that company seemed to be helping me grow, but ultimately it was never reflected in my titles or pay. Because I was so hopeless at finding work I stuck around. I thought the time would soon come that I could take my management experience, package it right, and get a bump up to Supervisor somewhere else maybe. Then Covid hit. I survived 3 rounds of layoffs but eventually was laid off. During this same time Boeing was hit hard by the Dreamliner crashings and the company decided to move 90% of its work to North Carolina in a business move, a place I couldn't follow because my wife's family lived here. \n\nFast forward 2 years and the job market is supposedly \"hot\" right now. My old company has positions open from operator to supervisor. I applied for the big positions first. I believed I was qualified and they knew me so I figured if they gave me an interview I pretty much had the job since they knew what they were getting. Well they never called. Later I applied for the lowly jobs at the company again. As things tightened up I was willing to take anything. They ghosted me. 7 years at this company of ~100 employees. I personally knew both HR staff, the COO, the Operations Manager, and anyone under them. They won't even give me the time of day. Fine. They're a company after all. I'll just add that the list of lessons I've had to learn the hard way. No one cares.\n\nSo life is giving me lemons. We press on. I consider seeking more school. Not sure what, but it didn't matter. I discovered that my transcripts wouldn't be sent around from my college because some clerical error had showed me as receiving zero credits for that summer course. As a result for the past decade I had been telling people I had a college degree but anyone who bothered to check would see otherwise. This was absolutely infuriating to discover. But I held my head high and pressed on. What could I do? It's not like I could afford a lawyer and it was all so long ago. \n\nSo I call up the student advising center. In an insane turn of events, my old college buddy who couldn't find a job with his bachelor's ended up getting his Master's there, worked there to save money on that, and ended up employed by the University as the head of the student advising office. So pile embarassment onto the luck, but my old acquaintance was able to help me through the process of appealing to the college. In the end, the graduation rules had changed so that technically I had enough credit hours even without the summer course being applied, but there was a problem. In order to reopen my account with the college, I had to send them all recent transcripts. So I had sent them the grades from my 6 month machining course. This in turn meant that my \"final 15 credit hours\" or w/e had not been completed at the college which violated a rule and prevented a simple rubber stamping of my diploma. In the end my friend 2000 miles away had to give the in-person verbal appeal on my behalf to a panel of decision-makers at the college. Luckily they saw fit to wave their hands and grant me my diploma. Seems fair since the program I missed credit for was literally a Bowling class. I had completed all core coursework and capstones.\n\nSo the first time I \"graduated\" college was in 2009 at the height of the housing bubble when I couldn't find employment with my degree. The 2nd time I graduated college was in December 2020 at the then-height of the Pandemic and I haven't been able to find employment with my degree or experience. Now add in 3 ectopic pregnancies for my wife and a now we have a bundle of medical debt, all my student debt, and things are just looking really grim for us. Luckily I saved pretty well and was also able to get some of the UI bonus last year, but this month I had to withdraw several thousand from my Roth retirement account (thanks machinist job) to stay afloat. We've been bleeding red since last September when the UI benefits stopped and my unemployment ran out. It won't be long be long before I have to start dipping into actual gains and start paying penalties on any withdrawals. I'm back to being very depressed. Our whole situation just stinks. We thought we've done everything how we're supposed to. We followed all the rules. We stayed hopeful. But now were facing the unthinkable. Moving in with her family in our mid 30's. And I don't have enough text to tell you how fucked up that would be.\n\nListen, the long and skinny of it is that I busted my ass early in life. I was told I had every advantage. And indeed I did. White male in the midwest. College educated. Not too ugly or pretty. The list goes on. I honestly can't think of what else I could've asked for besides someone to guide me along the way and help me transition all this into a gainful career. \n\nI'm willing to take full responsibility for my situation. I don't care how much of it was my fault or the \"system's fault\" or whatever. I'm sure I've sugar-coated my story a bit, but it's all history now, and the reality is here I am today. I'm a 35yo married man with dreams to have kids, own a home, and just try not to be destitute in my old age. I have over a decade of work experience, most of it assisting managers or being a manager myself, although I never received a title better than \"Lead\" or \"Assistant\". I've been responsible for the operation of multimillion CNC work centers, including training other newcomers. Anyone who knows CNC mills knows that it only takes a 1 second mistake to lead to VERY EXPENSIVE repairs. So when I say these were my responsibilities and people I directly oversaw worked them, it means I was reliable, laser-focused, and I made sure others around me were the same. I've coordinated production schedules, reviewed QA, created meticulous training programs, mediated disputes, and really just about done it all as mentioned previously. I'm ready for the next challenge. I'm ready for someone to bring me to the next level. I could type on and on and on explaining why I believe this is true. But it feels futile. I can't even find work at my \"current\" level or any level lower than that.\n\nThe \"hot\" job market doesn't seem to apply to me. I can't get management jobs. I can't get machinist jobs. I can't get Lead jobs. I can't get Fast Food jobs (I've tried, I'm desperate, but I must seem too 'something' to them cause they won't interview me or hire me either.) I can't seem to get any job beyond the most sketchy. I'm at my wit's end. The only conclusion left for me to draw is that I'm the problem, and I don't know how to fix that or even what to fix. I guess I've got a 2 year gap on my resume since being laid off at the start of Covid. But I filled that with \"finishing my college degree\" and \"started my own business\" (I've tried doing VO as a side-gig but literally has been a money pit for me. There's a story there if I could get into an interview to share it). And if that isn't enough, well then I can always point out that being furloughed in times of Covid should cover some of that gap. I've even tried getting some professional photos done to spice up my profiles. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I've completely fallen through the cracks of society and now I'm just waiting to be put out of my misery.\n\nI started writing this thinking I would post it to Career Guidance or Jobs or somewhere on reddit where maybe I could find help, but now I'm just more hopeless than when I started. I cannot imagine what it must feel like to be a disadvantaged member of our society. With every leg up, I've fallen flat on my face. With every natural and circumstantial advantage except overwhelming wealth...I've made nothing of myself. I own nothing. I have no prospects. The only and best thing in my life is my wife whom I love and I truly believe loves me the same.\n\nAnd worse. Despite all the life lessons and experience. I still have no idea what to do or how to fix it. I still have no idea how to succeed or even proceed. I'm no better off than when I was 13 years old at the end of 8th grade and my parents told me I WAS going to college. In fact, I'm worse off financially. At least then I had no debt or responsibilities beyond myself. Now I'm tens of thousands of dollars in debt with no end in sight and I'm responsible for more than just myself.\n\nI just glanced at the title I started with. I guess this is all pretty much in line. It feels like everyone around me is getting on with life. They're managing to make things work and some of them are even accomplishing dreams. They are finding jobs, finding new jobs, getting raises and promotions. They have trajectory. I feel like a dud. So many folks are out there making it with worse situations than me and I don't know how. I feel doomed to just keep bleeding retirement money until we're living off toast and ramen living in my in-laws basement. I try so hard to keep my head up and stay positive. Even now as I write I'm trying to be conscious of not coming across as too much of a whiny loser that is only going to attract angry replies and suicide-hotline links. \n\nIf I could have anything right now? If this post could change my life? It would give me the secret I need to get a good job, get promoted, and just live my life. But that's a crazy ask from a reddit post. So for now I'll just tell my story into the void and see if it makes me feel better. Maybe cross post a bit. If you made it this far I really appreciate you hearing this....paired-down version of events. It's hard to sum up anyone's life, even a portion it so of course I couldn't do that to my own. If you're someone who can help me understand what to do. Thank you.",

    "text": "(Teaching credential, data science, boat deckhand, financial advisor) Can you please give me feedback on the following career pathways for my situation? I could really use some insight with my situation, and I'm going to extrapolate my situation while describing pathways below. Essentially, I (at 31 years old) am considering one of the possible pathways to pursue. I want a stable career that is conducive to raising a family. I am based in California\n\n**Teaching Credential**\n\nI currently have a Master's degree in what used to be an in-need subject in education: Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages. I taught as a lecturer in university and an adjunct professor at community college for three years, before I got fed up with the working conditions and left. I loved what I did, but it was a dead-end: I knew people who were doing that for 10, 15, or 20 years without ever getting a fulltime job. People in this position have no real retirement plan, and haven't visited a doctor in years because the schools will not give them health insurance.\n\nPROS:\n\n* I am already a practiced teacher with all the skills, and I know what age range I would want to teach (Middle school).\n* K-12 teaching jobs are full-time, guaranteed. The schools would have no choice but to give me a full-time job, and medical insurance.\n* A teaching job would be most conducive to raising a family. Travel is important to me, and with school breaks we could travel to my heart's content.\n\nCONS\n\n* I would need to get a California teaching credential, which would take 2 additional years of school (taking useless classes) and $15,000.\n* Things like job protection, benefits, and pay are all being attacked in US society. I would essentially need to pay a significant amount of money to get the license to work a job that almost everyone quits within 5 years. While I've found that I get respect from individuals when I tell them I'm a teacher, the US government treats us like they hate us. I recently caught up with a friend who is a commissioned officer in the US Army. He told me that the army pays for all of his family's expenses, and gives gigantic bonuses and per diems. This would not be that.\n* My job (in US education) would be to prepare students to attend college/university. I know first-hand how badly US higher education is falling apart. I'd essentially be part of a system preparing them for failure.\n* I hated my coworkers, when I was a teacher. I don't need to get into it, but I was amazed at how bad people were at this job. Teachers tend to be \"book smart\", but astoundingly life stupid.\n* Education in the US is a feminized environment, and I'm a man. These types of environments don't appreciate gender diversity. In my experience, they want to limit men coming into their departments as much as possible; they will only hire other women to positions of authority, etc.\n\n**Data Science**\n\nI've discovered that I have something of a passion for probability, risk, and statistics. I think I would love a job in which I worked on polling data for a politician. I have a degree in Applied Linguistics and did my Master's thesis on verbal and participatory elicitation. I'm imagining something in which I conduct research on how well the public responds to policy phrasing and public opinion.\n\n EDIT: I forgot to mention that I did an internship in a community college's institutional research/effectiveness center. The Dean of the department was a really weird guy (seems commonplace in these environments. Hard workers beg for scraps, while the freaks are given 6-figure jobs with no work) but I liked the nature of the work a lot. *Essentially, I'm interested in creating and analyzing surveys.*\n\nPROS:\n\n* I feel like this is an in-demand skill world-wide. It has ultimately been my goal to leave the United States, and I feel like this could allow me to do that.\n* The job market is real. This wouldn't be like my days as a teacher, hustling to work for less-than-minimum wage.\n* The work would be intellectually stimulating and dynamic. It would offer me a mix of the stability I desire, with something that satisfies me.\n\nCONS:\n\n* I would have to go back to school. I've seen first-hand how bad American education is, and I always hesitate with something that requires me to subject myself to more school.\n* I would need to finance my own education. However, I don't see this as being as big of a con as the teaching credential, as I could focus on employable skills (i.e. the classes wouldn't be as useless).\n* I fear that it could lead me to a job that requires me to spend my days in front of a computer screen. I like interacting with other people. I want to focus on a more social job.\n\n**Boat Deckhand**\n\nAfter I left education after teaching in higher ed for three years, I decided to take other jobs to explore other career possibilities. I first took an entry level job at a luxury hotel in their spa, and I loved everything about it, apart from the management/hotel leadership. I loved that it was lightly social but would allow alone-time as well; I loved working as part of a team, with both men and women; furthermore, I loved that the job was lightly physical. I was eventually fired after I reported our management for inappropriate behavior, but I still have fond memories of the spa. I don't want to get into the specifics of my next job, but it was servicing a hot air balloon. The balloons are somewhat comparable to boats, as you need to work as a team to keep it moored and under control with the use of specific rope knots, it accommodates passengers, etc. This job was more physical and outside, which I liked. As a big negative, it had abusive management. I was forced to leave after I found them breaking the law, but I am expecting a sizeable settlement from this position.\n\nPROS:\n\n* The jobs is outdoors, it is technical and social, and I would work on certain skills that I've come to appreciate. The job descriptions I've read list accommodating passengers as a job function, and that was one of my favorite parts about hospitality.\n* I wouldn't need to go into debt to gain these skills. I could either attend a maritime science program (one of the community colleges I used to teach for has a respectable one), or according to another redditor the employers will train you on the job.\n* It's a full-time job. After I was burned so badly in the teaching world, I have come to appreciate anything and everything that is a full-time job.\n\nCONS:\n\n* I worry about the schedule. I'm looking for something that would allow me to have a family life, and not something that is going to bring me away from my family for days and weeks on end. Some deckhand jobs allow you to go home every night, so I would focus on that.\n* The job posting I've seen require \"at least 1 year of relevant experience.\" I worry that, even if I do a Maritime science degree, I won't make the qualification for 1 year of experience.\n* I'm 31 years old, and I don't want to do a lot of bitch work or get yelled at by someone born after 9/11. This is also why I hesitate to become a paralegal, and one reason I decided against joining the US Coastguard.\n\n**Financial Advisor**\n\nI have a passion for personal finance, which I discovered in my adult life. After I finished my degree in education, I taught myself the fundamentals (because, again, personal finance is not taught in US schools), and I discovered that it gave me very real, very salient power.\n\nPROS:\n\n* I have found the major three investment brokers (Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Vanguard) to be the most competent, user friendly, and frankly intelligent institutions I have ever interacted with. It stood out to me because US schools have been so abhorrent.\n* I looked online at, for example, entry level jobs with Fidelity. They're full-time (yay!) and would require me to acquire some licenses that I believe would only take a few months.\n* Personal finance is something near and dear to me on a personal level. Learning the fundamentals as an adult has been life changing, and has improved every aspect of my life (even outside of my finances). It is a passion; I am a devoted listener to the Clark Howard show, and have given my friends and family advice. To me, it would possibly be a way to combine my experience with teaching with my passion for personal finance.\n\nCONS:\n\n* I would be working for a major corporation (most likely Fidelity. My ideal is to work for the government, so I'd aim for that eventually I think). I've been burned in the past by private companies. I don't trust the private sector.\n* I worry about sedentary work. I am a physical person, I enjoy time outdoors. I do not want to work in front of a computer all day.\n* Work/life balance is important to me. Teaching allows me to travel, yet I'm not so sure this pathway would be as generous in that regard.\n\nThank you so much for your thoughts.",

    "text": "Do I drop out of school once again? I'm a French male 19.\n\n Back in high school, at 16, i quit out of shame and of feeling despised (this \"oh my god girls are looking down on me, all popular guys are douchbags and I am stucked with creeps like me I don't really wanna hang up with\" very classic kind of profile)...\n\n6 months stuck at home thinking I could finally write my book, muster up the courage and time to build my artistic skills with all that free time. \n\nIn the meantime, my creeps friends whom I had abandonned in a blink of an eye had begun flourishing. One became this psychedelics user and painter hosting parties in his coutryside home, the other got kicked out of his mom's house and by being homeless became a sort of charismatic adventurous black metal artist, a Valfar or Per Ohlin copypasta, and him and other of these \"creeps\" created a metal band as a pretext to hang out.\n\nI had not seen the potential of these people by being a piece of sht unable to see people as they really are, and at how high in charisma and social success could be at their best. I quit just the moment it became to be wild back there. Too bad. I didnt write, just watched youtube, didnt even play games which could at least have uppered my cultural and social credits.\n\nThen I got in a wood carving schools, running away. I still connected hardly to people, didnt write, demons kept following me.\n\n Then at the end of these two years I was 18 and could have chosen to leave once again, not seeing the potential of good life my commitment to my friends in this carving school could bring me, if regardless of all my shitty context i wanted to run away, numerous relational problems with all of this friends, and creativity still not flowing on the keyboard, i'd still stick to it.\n\nSo i followed these not that much friends in upholstery 2 years course in the same high school. And fucking regret it\n\n I hate upholstery, still cant manage to be creative, dislike a lot of the people here, and want to run away from them to become a better me and present this one to a new social group of unknown people, but in the meantime i genuinely love AWESOME people here ,  some are friends, some a bit less. \n\nI didnt wanna quit after carving because the learn-from-your-mistakes wiseness told me not to repeat my catastrophic 16yo year that made me miss a wonderful history of friendship with awesome people. But either by being stuck in the failed social context because fearing to losing the pearls in the garbage that are in it and that would lose contact with me and that I would have to start over in a new context OR when running away from this context by sacrificing the pearls, I still cant begin to be creative. \n\nYet I have all the ideas in my head but €procrastination€.\n\n Oh and if I leave I will be at my parents and its very humiliating because i cannot fully live and work on my projects by being into the fking nest of mommy, having my room asked getting cleaned and all the stuff, not being able to invite whoever i want or order the food or -healthy unaddictive-psychedelics I want, not having my private world. I'm stuck.\n\n Do I risk remaking the same mistake as in my 16nth year? \n\nDo I try getting an apartment and a shitjob to struggle away from the nest as a free grown man, to carve wood and write things and all?\n\n Or do I stay in this humiliating context to not lose all the social interactions I have with the awesome friends I have in this upholstery course?\n\n Or do I wait till covid ends to do this?\n\n Some friends in this highschool are metalheads and i love metal and would love to play the guitar with them but i cant play the guitar even though i personally own one, and leaving rn would repeat the pattern of when i quit my first school and see my friends forget me to work on music projects.\n\n Do I stay till the end of the course the time to learn some guitar, some chords, and integrate better with them and be later on in my life more easily in touch with the metal world? I don't have a fucking clue.\n I feel like an artist, always felt, and i dont wanna stagnate in this hole but not lose friends either. \n\nAm I fucked?\n\n I'm stuck with procrastination and asociality since middle school.\n\nP.S i'm diagnosed with aspergers\nP.P.S i decided to go in Berlin for my upholstery stage out of craving for travel but everything is closed, all my teachers think im a very very important student and the expect me to be as passionnate in this course as it takes to want to be the first to make this stage up there in our deutsche neighbourss home. So i can't drop out that easily and discretly. And yes i fell like this kind of idiot not wanting to get face masks in public, wtf am i doing in this DEAD lockdowned foreign city in a full pandemic....",

I should man up, and do law stuff to pay my degree and some teaching degree if I want to go back to the classrooms... But, my first years as a graduated, I learned teacher stuff, not law stuff... And I am a little too old to do beginners stuff because no one will hire me... And that's why I am freelancing, pretending to be a lawyer...\nSo, thank you if got this far, this is more a rant, or general complaint...\nBut, if you have an advice, something, that will be greatly appreciated. \nSo, any ideas?\nUn abrazo pana",

    "text": "What kind of future/career advancement is there in working for a company that facilitates students doing a semester abroad? Hey r/careerguidance, I could use some career guidance. \n\nSo I (34M) have been an ESL teacher in Spain for the last 6 years. I had a smattering of jobs before that but nothing that would amount to a career. Teaching has been great (sort of) but I decided that it isn't what I want to to long term and I needed to start thinking about alternatives while continuing to live in Barcelona, which is where I have built my life. \n\nLast year, I ended up doing a masters in marketing and sales hoping to facilitate a career change. Now, I knew that no one was going to be busting down my door to get at me for simply having a masters, but man oh man have I been surprised at just how little it seems to matter! I've been looking since May and I got close once but other than that I've had little luck. I can't even find and internship willing to touch me! I can't tell how frustrating and disheartening all this has been. \n\nAnyway, so I recently applied to a Program Coordinator for an organization that facilitates students doing a semester abroad and I have an interview lined up. It honestly seems like an interesting position and something that I could be good in, but I'm getting older and I really need to start thinking long-term. Also, it wouldn't be in marketing, which is fine, but I feel like i will have gotten (and paid for) this degree for nothing essentially. But that might be a but of sunk cost fallacy.\n\nDo you guys think this kind of position could lead to a sustainable career? \n\nWhat sort of experience would this give me to bring to future positions? \n\nI will want to move back to the US eventually. Are there jobs in this industry in the US, if so what kind of jobs? \n\nCould I take this kind of experience to work at a University in some capacity?\n\nAre these kinds of questions I could ask the interviewer, or would they look down on me already thinking beyond the job on the table? \n\nAny other advice would be most appreciated.

    "text": "Choosing teaching vs. other careers-are all careers as hard? feeling stuck(rant/advice) Hi guys, might be a long one here, sorry in advance.\n\nI live in a small UK village surrounded by small towns, and the most common jobs around here are care assistant, retail or warehouse/manual labor jobs-I'm not trying to knock these jobs, I know people in these jobs work hard for their money, my dad being one of them,  but my dad is a 60 year old man who works as a care assistant for minimum wage and can't get more than 25 hours because not all clients want a male carer. Despite this he is out the house from 7:30am often till 10:30pm because of all the driving and empty spaces between clients. We aren't starving but I know that's mostly because of the benefits he gets-benefits that won't be available to me. I'm worried about living to close to the povertyline, with no ability to save money or provide for him and my brother. I need a career to lift us out of it but am terrified of choosing wrong/regretting my decision and being stuck.\n\nSo I started studying a computing bachelors degree in the UK and kinda already feel stuck because of the path I'm on. I'm very new to IT and tech in general-I'm on the second year of the course and only studied art and design before this- and am now trying to look at what careers I could pursue, and have considered software development, IT support, teaching or retraining in healthcare. \n\nHowever I'm aware in IT and dev there's an expectation to always keep on top of new technology and seek new certifications and I do not have a strong passion for these so think I would find it difficult to keep up, not to mention there are fewer tech jobs near me and I cannot afford to move away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have considered healthcare but am aware unless I get another degree in nursing-which I know is a stressful degree leading to a stressful career and would likely require me to move (which I cant afford to do)-that all I can do is be a care assistant and it will be hard to support my dad and brother on that wage.\n\nSo my last possible option is teaching. I have heard mostly bad things about teaching, including poor work/life balance, increasing expectations and oversight, and poor mental health but I am also aware that in my area there are decent job opportunities, with far better pay than I could hope for elsewhere. I also am aware that I already struggle with mental health from our financial situation and lack of career direction-which would be reduced by a stable career, despite how difficult it may be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n My dad makes £10.4k per year($14.5k) but we live off £23k($32k) because of the benefits and a newly qualified teacher makes £25k($34k) minimum so it would be a large step up.\n\nI guess I wanted to know from others their teaching experience, If your own career(teaching or something else) has comparable expectations and stresses, and whether you feel this is a manageable career?\n\ntldr; I'm poor, don't want to be poor, so am considering teaching but want to know from others their experience in teaching and how manageable the stress is.",

    "text": "Extreeeemely long winded auto biographical post, beware, read at your own risk. Asking at end if there are remote internships available for someone like me after I get enough studying in. I  come from the SF bay area where I used to work as a professional  flamenco guitarist. But I haven't lived there since 2004.\n\nI currently  live In Mexico.I  have not worked at an office job or for any American company since 2010  when I worked for a major American manufacturer of software and  computer services in Guadalajara, Jalisco where I worked in  operations from 2005-2010.\n\nMy  Last job there was being the hardware order management rep on the  account for possibly the largest social media website in the USA at the  time. I actually processed over 100 million dollars worth of cloud  server rack orders for that account my last year there.\n\nThe  reason I left that company was due to personal reasons not  professional though. My ex wife worked in the same building and floor as  me. We actually got along pretty well still, but we had mostly the same  friends and likely many of our future romantic prospects would be  people from the company as the facilities were large, those were the  people we were most around and neither of us were actually from guadalajara. So that was an uncomfortable situation.\n\nIronically,  the reason I left being a musician in the bay area was to marry that wife  in Mexico as i couldn't find anyone compatible with me within my  flamenco community of the bay area (even though I worked with and around  about 60 different dancers).\n\nThe  only reason i got hired by this tech company was my native English skills. I actually  had to crash course excel for 2 weeks before starting working there. I  had never used MS Office before that. I studied Basic in junior high  over a summer, and I studied audio video electronics at a junior college  in the late 90's. That was the sum of my tech studies.\n\nHowever,  by the time I left the company in 2010 I was pretty adept at excel and had used  it to contribute to organizing the small and medium business order  management team that i was in to save many a man hour in our process  concerning working our open order reports. Unfortunately my immediate  superior took the brunt of the credit for what was mostly my efforts and  insight though 📷📷📷.\n\nWhat  I feel most proud of though is when in 2009 I got the assignment to  process the PO's for (social media website)'s cloud server rack orders into the system.Rack  server orders needed to be entered manually in a specific way into our  as400 system so that it did not fail when flowing to the SAP system in  Houston where the racks were configured.\n\nBefore entering a rack order,  we would need to send the PO or a quote for the rack configuration I  believe to 1 or 2 ladies in Omaha that would send us back a rack doc.  The rack doc was an excel document explaining how the order should be  entered so that it would flow correctly into SAP without failing.\n\nSo  since it was assigned to me to enter a ton of  these rack orders with several types of rack configurations in the  mix of them, I decided I needed to find a way to automate as  much as possible.So,  I remembered an internal tool (that almost no one used in my  department) where excel documents could be converted to quotes that  would drop and convert into orders in our as400 system. \n\nHowever the rack  documents would not work unless they were to be modified themselves,  and modifying them one by one would be just as much work.What  I did therefore was program into a worksheet in excel an if statement  using like 6 or 7 clauses(whatever the limit was at the time in XP days)  and it would take any rack doc pasted into the previous worksheet and  translate it into a quote in excel that would not fail and would  corectly populate the line items for whatever  quantity I would specify in the previous worksheet. And THAT is how I  got all them orders in. And that fulfilling experience stuck with me and  led me to want to start coding now a decade later even though I am now  44.\n\nWhat is very cool is that that year was the first year a company other  than (Famous Seattle Software Company) became (my company)'s largest  Direct customer and I was ( just  due to peculiar circumstances) able to be on the account team for it.  Also peculiar, is that since I had been moved around laterally to  different departments so much (instead of getting higher positions that I  had applied for - non supervisor positions btw) I was uniquely probably  the most qualified to handle that task,  and not only that, it was more  fulfilling for me than any of them other positions I had applied for  would have been. God is good, his hand was on everything the whole time  when I had felt that I was being unfairly looked over, when in reality  he had prepared me for something much more fulfilling. To be properly  used as an individual (no matter what it is for and no matter how much  money  it is, whether nothing or billions) is possibly the most fulfilling  thing one can experience in this life. \n\nWhen I worked at that company I  was so driven at times to find a way to improve the processes of my team  and myself that there were occasions that I would stay at the  facilities until 1:00 am working on ways to make things easier and more  efficient (even though my shift had ended at 5:00 pm the day before).\n\nThat  is why I have started studying programming since 5 half months  ago. I have been mostly studying C but am now studying C++ as my older  programmer friend was adamant that I knock those two out before learning  other languages.\n\nSince  2010, I have lived on the pacific coast of Mexico in a place called San  Blas, Nayarit where my parents retired to. I was an english teacher for  a year which I hated and then a jackfruit farmer for the past 8 years.  But I no longer like jackfruit farming as it requires too much time and  money to be feasible. I would rather code and work remote, which is why i  am studying these things, not to mention that I think I should have  studied this stuff in college instead of music and electronics (which i  gave up to go full time into music anyways). I say that because I like  coding as much as I like playing music but coding would have probably  included a much more stable and secure life :).\n\nBut  it is looking like web development might be more suitable for my  situation. However, if it were for me, I think I would have maybe been  more attracted  to learning how to work with either embedded systems or maybe as a data  engineer. But those jobs would probably require me to relocate and that   is not possible right now. \n\nI could travel for flexible periods of time  but not up and relocate. My  wife(2nd wife) doesn't want to move from here as she wants to be near  her family here and I do not want to be away from my parents that  retired here either as they are getting old.\n\nBut in all honesty I am very flexible and willing to do anything as long as I am given  a task to achieve and a problem to solve (as that is what most matters t me). I love to help solve other  people's problems and make their lives more efficient. I am the one on  the team that seeks to facilitate the leaders and workers alike more  than to be a leader myself. I may be ignorant of much, but whenever I  get up to speed I feel like I usually end up in the upper percentile.\n\nWhat my past experience has most made me realize though is that on-the-job training is usually more fruitful than schooling.\n\nSo.....\n\nAfter  I get enough schooling (online and books), are there descent remote  internship opportunities available for someone in my situation?\n\nI  can get long-winded so this is maybe too long for you to read  :). Sorry. \n\nBTW, If anyone wants to see a video of me playing flamenco  guitar to backup my story, just ask and I will pass the link :)\n\nThanks",

And I'm not mentioning the quality of the teacher (David Malan) that's light years ahead of the PowerPoint, half-asleep aged man we have in front of us in every class. Of course they probably don't go too in-depth with their content, but that single course seems like more content than a full-year of university I've had here in Canada. Things like Security isn't even a subject that's talked about at all. When I've gone through my university's program we pretty much used Java and I had like 4 courses just explaining the basic of programming with it like I had a full class where we didn't even used functions AT ALL, just really simple programs and they go through 5 different languages in the beginning. I was so bored in my classes and wanted some good challenges like what I'm seeing in that CS50 class.\n\nI just feel like even though now I know I can learn everything on my own (and I do), my education seemed it was total bullshit compared to some of those US universities, they aren't the top schools for nothing I guess. The level of the students that come out of those schools is so much higher than what my school can produce is insane. The worst Harvard student is probably more competent than the best here with that kind of education.\n\nDoes anybody feel the same about their education?",

    "text": "17 yr old conflicted about doing CS So fyi im a high school senior, and seeing these salaries of 300k are really enticing me to pick up coding, particularly SWE. However SWE is probably the hardest part of the tech job world imo. I took 3 CS classes in high school over java, learning basic OOP fundamentals to data structures lkke binary trees, and concepts of Big O. It was mildly interesting, however when my teacher assigned lab assignments, I was frustrated. It often included assignments about solving a puzzle using the topics I learned, but i couldn't implement the topics for the life of me, ie linked lists. It was so frustrating being on one error for 3 hours the night before it was due. I would often turn in incomplete labs that had errors. Honestly this made me have a bad view of coding in OOP languages. Is it just me? I did procrastinate alot and never practiced code on my own. I highly prefer math over coding, so I was considering doing data science, as i find statistics and modeling more appealing. What should I do? Should i power through and learn java/python and libraries and the APIs and try to catch the bread of six figures? Or do what I like man its so hard to pass up those 200k salaries because i didnt like coding in high school. But honestly the concepts of OOP never tripped me up nor the math just implementing it was kinda painful. I need advice if i should power through and do CS in college, but I originally was going to do math major.",

    "text": "Growing as a Black Lady I’m not sure how to write this, but I’m about to move out of my white community that I spent the majority of my life in. I’m just beginning to see that a lot of the trauma I’ve experienced in life is from racist white people and systematic racism, and I’m  done. I think I just need to rant therapeutically.\n\nMy black parents moved to my area in the 1980s to escape the crack epidemic in the city before I was born. They were very “old school” to say the least. They tried to enroll my sisters in the local Catholic school, and the nun interviewing them asked them “Do you live in *insert only poor predominately black community in three counties here*?”\n\nThey weren’t sure what microaggression the nun was insinuating, but it rubbed them the wrong way. Around town one of the neighbors told my parents the local public school was actually the better option academically. So that’s where my sisters were enrolled. My middle sister actually made out decently, but my oldest sister had a hard time. My middle sister was actually crowned *Miss _*insert town here*” and almost went to the state beauty pageant. Never seen before or after in my town. They were both harassed by the school bus driver (who, years later saw the error of his ways and made sure I wasn’t harassed on his route). The school principal and teachers made a point of humiliating my oldest sister. When my sister brought it up to my parents, my parents said “well it’s not like they’re turning the hoses on you. Deal with it.” In their old-school mentality. My oldest sister is still in a cocktail of psych meds today from the abuse she received going through this school, including sexual assault. \n\nMe? Where to begin with me? I was the youngest in my entire grade and the only black child at a new school. The first teacher I ever had in elementary school husband was a reknown bigot in town, and said teacher tried her best to make sure I was held back. She never gave me any attention in class. Funny, to go to the next grade level I had to be tested (the deal my parents worked out with the school). The results came back that although I was the youngest in the grade-level, I was academically a whole year ahead of my classmates with just the equivalent of being at best ignored or regularly bullied each day. The way my parents tell it if it wasn’t for the teacher’s union the administration and Board of Ed would have fired her on the spot.\n\nUp until 8th grade it was pretty uneventful on the social front, I was still emotionally immature, but had a small group of girlfriends. Academically I was still ahead of most of my peers, but each year the bullying by the teachers became more and more intense. Could it be an emotionally younger student is an easier target? Sure, but looking back I think the teachers were looking for low-hanging fruit. Starting in 5th grade, I remember a teacher who liked to bully low-hanging fruit take me aside after another clique tattled on me and said meanly “there’s something wrong with you”. That stuck with me until I started anti-depressants a year ago and was my universal truth. \n\nEnter the guidance counselor. The middle school guidance counselor automatically had me slated as a “bad kid”. I was having a middle school girl fight with one of my girlfriends (truly over something petty). Looking back, I was probably beginning to experience symptoms of childhood depression around age 10 or 11. The middle-school guidance counselor threatened to call the police on me if I upset one of my girlfriends again. She found any excuse to drag me into the principals office (who was a level-headed man, he would just shoo me away within two minutes). 8th grade, there was a switch and my classmates became blatantly racist towards me. No one defended me. We had a new principal 8th grade and he enabled the bullies towards me. Looking back, I was not only depressed, but had begun to exhibit some symptoms of OCD. I had my first panic attack over these bigoted bullies when I was 13. I never told my parents as I was completely shut down and silent at home.\n\nEnter high school, long story short... more of the same. I was not accepted by my white peers, and the few other black kids at the school did not accept me because I was not “black enough”. During these awkward years I was pushed out of the closet as an lgbtq student. So, it truly felt like “we can’t dislike her because she’s black, but we can dislike her for being bisexual”. I was basically the school pariah. Did I mention when the white students came out of the closet they were elevated to popular levels? Some students were openly racist. Once again due to depression I was shut down and nothing was done about it. My OCD, Panic Disorder, and depression was severe in high school. My OCD came up in untraditional ways than cleaning and hand washing; rather I had scrupulosity, limerace, disordered eating, compulsive exercising, sexual OCD, verbally repeating words/sentences, thought cycling, maladaptive daydreaming, and excoriation disorder. Do you want to know what an obsession feels like? Imagine having intrusive, anxiety provoking thoughts on an topic ALWAYS. Sometimes it’s something average about work or school. Sometimes they are grossly inappropriate like socially-unacceptable sexual thoughts. Or anything in-between. Always. When you wake up, when you go to bed, during the SATs and GREs, at your grandma’s funeral. Always! You cannot turn that off. People don’t understand.\n\nWanna know what a compulsion feels like? You know that feeling when your having sex and you’re about to cum? That’s what the build up feels like. When you orgasm, that’s what engaging in the compulsion feels like. So, every time I engaged in religious rituals (my family was Catholic so it was hella easy for this aspect of my OCD to fly under the radar for a while), that I HAD to do or I was damned to hell, this is what it felt like. If I didn’t engage in a religious ritual, it was panic attack inducing.  That’s just ONE aspect of my compulsive nature. As an adult, I stay away from all organized religion. I’m very happy with this decision.\n\nThis was in the early 2000s. Even in my awkward teenage years I was intelligent, I knew something was “wrong”, but when I approached “safe” adults to say something was up I was told I was “looking for attention”. I tried to see my high school guidance counselor, but it became clear that she may have thought she could start an inappropriate relationship with me. She laughed off my concerns and enabled rumors that we were dating. When it got scary, I mustered up the little strength I could and told her to F off and never talk to me again. I was still shut down at home so my parents didn’t know what was going on. They also knew something was “wrong”, but instead of helping me get the help I need, they just screamed at me to “be normal” until a panic attack was induced. My parents would once again say “there’s something wrong with you.”\n\nStarting in college, at a PWI, I finally began healing and I was accepted for who I was. I went to therapy regularly and I truly bloomed.  \nI was still bullied by mean racist girls, but I had a circle of friends who would shut them down because it was the right thing. For the first time, my college had a multi-cultural club, and I had black girlfriends and I began to learn what it meant to be a black lady!\n\n\nThroughout my travels in life, I have consistently been rejected because I was either black or not black enough. I’m an educated woman with a successful career. I’m finally moving out of my racist white county. Is it weird that this is bitter sweet? Its gotten more obviously racist over the years. Trump flags are still up. Blue Lives Matter people are silent over the Jan 6 attacks, but the area is truly beautiful. If things were different I wish I could raise a family there. The cherry on top of everything is when another black family moved into town from a predominantly black area. As a good neighbor I went to say hello, excited to have someone else in town who looked like me. The family was very cold me to with the common look I get from some other black people of “not black enough”. \n\nThere are some very good people in this town. This may sound controversial, but a LOT of town cops and local state troopers made public statements during the BLM protests that “Black Lives Matter” over and over again. They marched with BLM, and were uncomfortable at Blue Lives Matter rallies. The whole community is taking steps to embrace inclusiveness and diversity. They are finally having real conversations. \n\nOne of the few things that came out of COVID-19 is that I started anti-depressants. My “old school” black parents were and still are highly embarrassed I attend therapy sessions, and told me my whole childhood that “only people in crisis go to therapy; only people with something wrong with them go on psych meds”. My life became clear and I found the strength to just leave. I realized how severe my Panic Disorder once when I began to take a PRN med for them every week and a half or so. That didn’t count the panic attacks I had behind a closed door at work or simple panic attacks that didn’t warrant a PRN. Since I was 13, I’ve been averaging 2-3 panic attacks a WEEK. I’m in my 30s... My therapist and my primary collaborated to add an additional medication last month, and for the first time ever the OCD symptoms, which have been notably decreasing since a year ago, (heads up they’ve always gone down little by little since talk therapy) went down significantly in the past month. It was like before I could only walk a mile, and out of nowhere I could run a marathon. I still have work to do in that area, but I count my blessings. \n\nHowever, the bigots are getting louder and louder. If you have guessed where I’m from yet, a local politician recently gutted a local anti-hate bill to only list BLM and Antifa as hard groups (if I understood the controversy correctly). A part of me wants to stay and fight for the town I love, but I think this just may be some sunk-cost fallacy. There are maybe four people in my town who I’m going to keep in touch with. This place is not good for my mental health, which is an ongoing project to heal. The area I’m moving to is far more diverse, mix of black, white, and Hispanic. The community over is predominately Indian, black, and Hispanic. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I fit in in my new community. Where I don’t stand out like a sore thumb just for having more melanin to white people; where I’m not teased for speaking the King’s English to other Black people. I love that feeling.\n\nWhat should I do next? I like what I do at work, but I think it’s time to take the next step in my career... also, I hate being one of the only black people as high up as I am in the company (1st world problems, I know)... I really want to find a company that is more diverse. Should I join the NAACP? Links? Or should I just be me and know I’m exactly where I should be in life?\n\nI don’t know... I’ve never been around a large group of black women in my life (the group of black girlfriends I had, though healthy and fabulous, was small). Have any of you ever experienced any of this? What do you recommend the next steps be as a strong black woman on my life journey?",

Any time you experience racism is jarring, whether it’s subtle or blatant & crude— however it’s definitely much more surreal and off-putting when you’re a child because you have yet to “come into your blackness.” You know about things like slavery, segregation, Jim Crow and apartheid but you are too young to understand the effects of these things and how that shapes society— and you absolutely have yet to grasp how nuanced racism is. \n\nWe have been calling these moments our “If I Wasn’t a Child” moments, because we would’ve handled them much differently if we weren’t children. \nHere’s one from me: \n\nI was in a majority white accelerated program in middle school, at fairly mixed school in a very white county. In our Latin class before the bell had rung, someone mentioned the word “audacity”. I turned to my two friends (who were also black girls) and said something like “I feel like that’s a word black moms use ONLY when they’re angry with you.” We all laughed because we couldn’t recall our moms using that word in any other instance. Literally just sharing in a black experience. My Latin teacher, who was a white man, overheard us and very irritatedly told us “That’s just a word that ANYBODY can use at ANY TIME.” We all just looked at him dumbfounded.  If I wasn’t a child, I would have spoken up and told him that he completely missed the point and made it divisive when it wasn’t. lol\n\nSo what are y’all’s “If I Wasn’t a Child” moments?\n\n(Edit: formatting)",

Deleted if inapproproate!\n\nI am 100% NYer, first generation American, born and raised in Brooklyn in a heavily Italian dominated neighborhood. I was lucky enough to be surrounded by people who have been supportive and understanding of our traditions and cultures, from teachers to friends to neighbors. But that doesn’t mean I didn’t have my fair share of racism growing up. \n\nI vividly remember this one incident when I was 11/12 years old, walking to school every morning with my mom and my brother, carrying a heavy trumpet case. For a whole month, an old white man with a cane, what I assume was around 80 yo, would walk right past us, spit at us, and call us “chinks” and to “go back to your own country”. The young me doesn’t understand why it is happening, but I know it made me angry. We would end up taking the longer route to school, or even just crossing the street when we see him walking toward us. But that doesn’t stop him from harassing us. One day, I had enough. As he walked past us, spit at us, I turned and screamed, “Why don’t you go back to your own country? We have the same right to be here as you.” My mom grabbed me and told me to stop and to not cause any trouble. I remember heading into school, and crying in the staircase because of what happened. From that day on, I never saw him again. \n\nCulturally, we are taught to keep our heads down, do what we are suppose to do: go to school, get good grades, get a good job, and DON’T CAUSE ANY TROUBLE. Funny thing is, I was never the type to “keep my head down” and to “keep quiet”. I am very vocal about the injustices growing up.

    "text": "Pushing Hands (1991): A movie contrasting Confucian tradition with Western Life &#x200B;\n\n[ Sihung Lung as Mr. Chu  and  Deb Snyder as Martha Chu, his daughter-in-law](https://preview.redd.it/y9s3brwjheq61.jpg?width=338&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1169587db08c2da3e0924d70663722bd4675816c)\n\nI watched this movie last night on Amazon Prime. The movie starts with Mr. Chu practicing Taiji Quan in the living room while Martha is sitting rigidly at a computer. After the elderly man finished his routines, he set about making lunch for himself. Since there was no plastic wrap, he covered a bowl in aluminum foil and stuck it in the microwave. The first words that are spoken between them are from the woman who hears the crackling discharge as the foil sparked in reaction to being microwaved.\n\nAfter racing to the kitchen, she pulled the bowl out of the microwave, ripped off the foil, and held it up to Mr. Chu. \"NO METAL\" she snapped. \"NO METAL.\"\n\nThere was no reply. \n\nDuring lunch, Mr. Chu ate from the bowl with chopsticks. The woman ate a completely different meal of vegetables with bread. The meal was eaten in complete silence. \n\nIt took me a while to figure out that Mr. Chu was a retired Taiji Quan Master whose son Alex, had saved money for years in order to bring him to the United States. Martha was Alex's wife. The couple had a son, Jeremy who was played by Haan Lee. \n\n[Mr. Chu smokes outdoors while Martha tries to ignore him by reading a book.](https://preview.redd.it/bma6ybkymeq61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=815d9969732d76cf00d2b68278457a5c4e26cce1)\n\nThis film is about the clash between eastern and western cultural values. Mr. Chu believes in traditional Confucian virtues. He does not speak English and has no interest in learning. Martha is an American novelist who is suffering from writer's block because she finds her father-in-law's presence in their \"cramped home\" distracting. She wants to move into a larger home which would have an in-law suite that would then allow her some degree of privacy while she writes. Although she has picked up a few words of Chinese, she does not speak enough to communicate with her father-in-law. \n\nAs Chinese Americans Alex and and Jeremy straddle both cultures. As a first generation ABC (American born Chinese), Jeremey attends a Chinese language school in an effort by the parents to keep him in touch with his culture. Alex disagrees with his wife about their \"cramped home\" and tells her that in China 4 families could live in a home of this size. He refuses to move because moving would mean that he would have to accept financial assistance from his mother-in-law. \n\nMr. Chu does not think much of American parenting skills. When  Jeremey asks to be excused from dinner, his mother tells him that he may leave after he finishes his milk. The father-in-law observed to his son that American parents think that all interactions with their children are business transactions that have to be negotiated. When Jeremey turns on the TV to watch cartoons, the old man deplores the senseless violence that his grandson is being exposed to. The translated conversation appears as English subtitles. \n\nWhen Martha asked her husband what the father-in-law had said, Alex tactfully mentioned the cartoons but left out any mention of his father's thoughts about American parenting. \n\nWithout saying more, I will simply observe that the characters have been introduced and the tone of the movie has been set. Will the four of these people be able to coexist in their home? If they are not able to live together, what will happen? \n\n[Mr. Chu uses his Taiji Quan skills to teach at the community center. ](https://preview.redd.it/9ll4polmneq61.jpg?width=688&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6327aaf8b15f6a8897b2469e86b477e94536e0b4)\n\nIt was somewhat painful to watch this movie. I'm a sixty year old 3rd generation American and a 1st generation ABC. Watching this movie brought back some bitter sweet memories of visiting my paternal grandparents in California. It also made me think about my relationship with my father. \n\nAlthough my father was the eldest son of his generation, when the time came for someone to take care of his aging parents, he declined to do this. He was employed by the U.S. Public Health Service as a tropical disease specialist and at the time this conversation first came up, he was on TDY (tour of duty) in Bangkok, Thailand. Taking care of his parents would have meant returning stateside to California and possibly ending his career. The responsibility for taking care of the parents fell to his younger brother who was a doctor with the California Public Health Service. \n\nAs with the Chu family in the film, my cousins were raised in a multi-generational home. Since my Uncle's wife was also ethnic Chinese, they were not raised in a biracial home as Jeremey was in the movie. \n\nWhile my grandfather did not practice Taiji Quan, he did meditate. He would sit on the floor in his Tang suit with his limbs cross legged under him and would remain absolutely still with his eyes closed in complete silence. \n\nUnlike Mr. Chu in the movie, my grandfather was a Presbyterian who had been converted to Christianity by American missionaries. My father tells me that when my grandfather caught his wife offering rice to a Buddhist monk,  he seized the monk by his robe and booted him out on the street while yelling in Chinese, \"HALLELUAH, I'M A CHRISTIAN!\" \n\nMy cousins all spoke some Chinese and attended a Chinese language school. They also attended a Chinese American church which offered bilingual sermons. I didn't speak Chinese at all and since my parents wanted me to assimilate into the American culture, they had made the conscious decision to not teach me any Cantonese.\n\nWhile my cousins grew up using chopsticks while eating Chinese food prepared by my grandmother and aunt, I grew up using a fork and a knife to eat American food that my mother made using recipes from a Betty Crocker cookbook. While they ate sticky rice, congee, and bao, I grew up eating spaghetti and meatballs, meatloaf with mashed potatoes, brown gravy, and peas, and pot roast with potatoes, onions, cabbage, and carrots. \n\nMy father has long since deplored the decision to raise me as an American because he thinks that I am much too independent.\n\nIf I were a dutiful son, I would have followed his advice to become a lawyer instead of becoming a teacher. I would have met a woman, married, and given him grandchildren. After he retired, I would have quit my job to move back to California to act as an adult caretaker for my aging parents. I've always wondered about the hypocrisy of this last expectation because my father declined the same request when the time came for him to take care of his parents.",

See below for all the studies. What do you expect when feminsim teaches extreme misnadry, male privelge theory etc.... that feminise teachers will be like this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrevious submission got deleted by mod eventually so reposting here... still check it out as many excellent comments from men and women about their experience of this bias... many pointed out very obvious misandric comments from their teachers, some teachers even commented about their biases:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers\\_mark\\_girls\\_higher\\_for\\_identical\\_work\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers_mark_girls_higher_for_identical_work_to/)\n\nThis is an unpopular fact as it widely held in society that women and girls are discriminated against in education and in work, indeed in everything in life.\n\nNote; below is general statement, countless awesome teachers but....\n\n**Education is an example of institutional sexism. Now this data should to even feminist not be surprising... after all they call male majority and even female majority places as rife with sexism and \"male norms\" i.e. women have to act like men... is it any surprise then in teaching where 98% of early educators are female, 90% primary school teachers are female and these teachers have often studied gender studies type radical subjects at uni, and all HR and admin is female, that there is \"female norms\" being applied in education..... that the default child is a girl according to teachers? As the following data shows e.g. female teachers punishing boys for entirely normal behaviour that they dont understand; marking girls higher for IDENTICAL work, and giving higher predicted grades (despite boys objectively getting higher real life assesments) as they prefer girl students as model students and can relate to girl students better.... it is no wonder that schools are reducing play times, even removing physical education completely and replacing it with in class movement.... i.e. an entirely anti boy environment.... if 40% of boys are being drugged with aderal in some schools, do you think 40% of boys are unwell or maybe its the teachers who are shit and the system they made?**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOver then entire OECD countries globally, a large scale study showed that girls were given higher marks for IDENTICAL work to boys. OECD also showed that a boy receives 1/3 higher grade if the teacher does not know he is a boy. Interestingly this gender gap goes away when it is a male teacher doing the marking.\n\n[https://www.tes.com/news/teacher-stereotyping-means-higher-marks-girls-says-oecd](https://www.tes.com/news/teacher-stereotyping-means-higher-marks-girls-says-oecd)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/eliminating-feminist-teacher-bias-erases-boys-falling-grades-study-finds](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/eliminating-feminist-teacher-bias-erases-boys-falling-grades-study-finds)\n\nCornwell found that boys in all racial categories are not being *“commensurately graded by their teachers”* in any subject *“as their test scores would predict.”*\n\nThe answer lies in the way teachers, who are statistically mostly women, evaluate students without reference to objective test scores. Boys are regularly graded well below their actual academic performance.\n\nBoys are falling significantly behind in grades, *“despite performing as least as well as girls on math tests, and significantly better on science tests.”*\n\nAfter fifth grade, he found, student assessment becomes a matter of *“a teacher’s subjective assessment of the student’s performance”*, and is further removed from the guidance of objective test results. Teachers, he says, tend to assess students on non-cognitive, *“socio-emotional skills.”*This has had a significant impact on boys’ later achievement because, while objective test scores are important, it is teacher-assigned grades that determine a child’s future with class placement, high school graduation and college admissibility.\n\nEliminating the factor of *“non-cognitive skills…almost eliminates the estimated gender gap in reading grades”*, Cornwell found. He said he found it *“surprising”* that although boys out-perform girls on math and science test scores, girls out-perform boys on teacher-assigned grades.\n\nThe report also found that:\n\n* At primary level 85% of teachers are female. This has remained roughly the same since 2003.\n* At secondary level the percentage of male teachers has fallen steadily at first and later precipitously from 40% in 2003 to 31.7% in 2012.\n\n**It has been shown that boys and girls do better in reading when they have a same sex teacher. Just one year with a male teacher reduced the reading gap by 1/3 for 13 year old boys.

At this point, the writers' names (Andrew or Sarah) were revealed, revealing that one was a man, the other a woman. Participants submitted a grade to each writer, as well as substantive comments to improve their essays.\n\nParticipants were more likely to tell white lies to the woman writer,  **inflating Sarah's grades nearly a full letter grade higher than from their initial private evaluation. They also gave her more positive comments than they gave Andrew. In contrast, the man's in-person feedback was statistically indistinguishable from the participants' undisclosed evaluations of his work.**\n\n**Please note:** When this study was reported, it was reported as being discrimination towards women as their performance was being upgraded and they weret being given correct feedback, rather than the more obvious statement, that men are being disrimnated against and women work is being marked up.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBoys 'being held back by women teachers' as gender stereotypes are reinforced in the classroom\n\n[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1307856/Boys-held-women-teachers-gender-stereotypes-reinforced-classroom.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1307856/Boys-held-women-teachers-gender-stereotypes-reinforced-classroom.html)\n\nChristian Hoff Sommers explains how boys are being punished for normal behaviours:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFpYj0E-yb4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFpYj0E-yb4)\n\nDo Schools discrimiante against boys: Dr. Jim Dueck, author, former Assistant Deputy Minister of Education for the province of Alberta, and former head of Accountability and Student Assessment, performed a revealing analysis on current practices in student assessment. The results were not only remarkable but very disturbing, exposing what might well be an institutional suppression of the performance of male students.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qloY4OJxBoQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qloY4OJxBoQ)\n\nRelated, despite a widely held view to the contrary, in a large scale national study, women are favoured 2:1 over IDENTICAL or even slightly more qualified men in STEM applicationss but gender BLIND helps men significantly, and the latter is now becoming less commonly applied as a result.\n\n[https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360)\n\nThis could go to explain why many prominent claims of discrimination have failed as there is a perceived bias but on investigation, this is proved false e.g. US womens football team equal pay claim led to the judge saying the women were paid more than men, or women suing Google only for Googles results to show they were paying mens less.\n\nFunding:\n\nFemales given $6 billion per year more in grants by government for education despite being the overwhelming majoirty in university\n\n[https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=13620&fbclid=IwAR1zxexkrfKy5VeGcW0IC-hUy6mgUMQS4F8di\\_Eyk3ZDt2jhMVgtTcX6WcA](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=13620&fbclid=IwAR1zxexkrfKy5VeGcW0IC-hUy6mgUMQS4F8di_Eyk3ZDt2jhMVgtTcX6WcA)\n\nThere are also 11 female only scholarships per 1 male one, with some universities have 100 female only scholarships and none for men, again despite men being a minority in university, and in alsmost all courses (even in STEM technically men are a minority, its only a few specfic subjects e.g. physics, computer science that men are a majority while women are a majority in Medicine, Biology, Nursing, Psychology, Veteniary Medicine etc)\n\n**At home (similar ins school):**\n\nBoys are more likely to receive corporal punishment from their parents then girls ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952896/)). They are also, in general, more likely to recieve severe verbal and physical punishment from both mothers and fathers ([source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227312033_Harsh_Discipline_and_Child_Problem_Behaviors_The_Roles_of_Positive_Parenting_and_Gender/link/55aeac6b08aed9b7dcdda4c0/download)). Some studies indicate the difference is less pronounced at the home and may be non-significant in the first years of infancy ([source](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/113/Supplement_5/1952.full.pdf)), but the difference is still present in the same direction as it is in schools for most of adolescence.\n\n**Can something be done? Of course:**\n\n[http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/sept06/vol64/num01/Teaching-to-the-Minds-of-Boys.aspx](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/sept06/vol64/num01/Teaching-to-the-Minds-of-Boys.aspx)\n\nThis school took a boy friendly approach. What was applied is explaied in detail. **Boys performance rocketed, gender gap went and girls performance went up nearly as much too.**Current system is bad for everyone but it just s happens it massively favours girls. I think it will get worse bad sterotypes about boys and now literally every other story about manspreading, mansplaining, toxic masculinty, menaretrash (real hashtag on twitter) all will not help. There is no political will... in the UK the head of uni admissions even said she thinks its a scandal no one is doing anything about plumetting uni levels for boys and if any other group it would be an outrage.... Uni of Arizona has 160 female only scholarships and 2 male ones despite women outnumbering men in almost every single degree... in the very few that they dont in STEM (not even all stem, for example more female medics, biology, vets) they are actively recruiting girls but doing nothing for boys\n\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/05/real-reasons-girls-outperforming-boys-school/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/05/real-reasons-girls-outperforming-boys-school/)\n\nTelegraph article on number of men in teaching, and techers openly admitting to sexism in favour of girls:\n\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html)\n\nI do know from my own direct experience that many young women of the 1960s and 1970s went into teaching inspired by a feminist mission to raise the self-esteem and the social position of girls. I could name at least half a dozen women teachers I knew personally in the later decades of the last century who were proud to say that they favoured girls in class to make up for the oppression of women in the past. The moral dubiety – and outright sexist prejudice - of inflicting second-class treatment on little boys who could bear no personal responsibility for those alleged (and profoundly questionable) historical crimes never seemed to trouble those apostles of equality. Men are hardly likely to become primary school teachers because they feel they owe a duty to their sex\n\nBy the same token, I can name a similar number of feminist commentators in the media/political establishment who celebrated the rise of educational attainments for girls in school as evidence that females are, by birth and nature, superior to males. As girls overtook boys in grades and exam results at all levels throughout the education system, those sisters were cock-a-hoop at their gender’s triumph – never acknowledging that the advantage of one sex must have been bought at the expense of the other. Not one Secretary of State for Education in the last 40 years has expressed concern that the [gender divide in academic achievement ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/11364130/Girls-do-better-than-boys-at-school-despite-inequality.html)reflected a worrying ethos in schools that imposed disadvantage and inequality on boys. They wouldn’t dare.\n\nAlong with the politicians, men, as a whole, simply gave in to this feminist-driven growth of inequality with the bovine supinity which has characterised their outlook for the last half century. Have you ever met a man who was fretting anxiously that his own son/s were being unfairly treated at school?",

Recent one e.g. asking all boys to stand up and apologise for their sins e.g. gained media attention and outrage by parents.\n\nIf your school does girl sessions for STEM or sports, this is great and to be encouraged. Ask your schools what they are doing gor boys also. Are they trying to increase boys entrollment in college? The gender gap in exlcusions, leaving school with no qualifications etc.\n\nGender equality is great, but it needs to mean gender equality. Do not exlude boys from the good programmes you have for girls, and do not poison these programmes with false anti male ant boy idealogy.\n\nHere is a great report by Save the Children, that rarely actually looks at boys in educations very thoroughly. It has some great insights into just how pervasive this problem is. Sadly it doesnt mention the teacher bias much, but it covers most other things.\n\n[https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/content/dam/global/reports/the\\_lost\\_boys\\_report.pdf](https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/content/dam/global/reports/the_lost_boys_report.pdf)\n\nHere is a great comment by a user:\n\n# Imagine  a 14 yr old girl, all her teachers were mostly men.  In her country  girls are marked less than boys for the same work.  In her country girls  are much more likely to be disciplined, to be expelled, and not to  finish school.  In her country, almost all primary caregivers are men.   Fewer women than men have gone to college for at least 40 years.  But of  course the efforts to get more men into college march steadily on.  She  is surrounded by Boy Power and The Future is Male!  Academic journals  will print anything that denigrates her sex, even if its something  Hitler wrote as long as jews are replaced with women.\n\n# (and  this bias exists in almost every single institution...she will receive  harsher sentences for the same crime, she is about 10x more likely to be  shot than a man, she is much more likely to be a victim of a violent  crime, she will die sooner, less will be spent on her healthcare, there  will be fewer programs for her across every single government agency.   She will commute further, she will work longer, she will be 20x more  likely to die on the job, etc etc)\n\n# But  despite those facts, she goes to school to learn about how everything  is setup to benefit her.  About how bad her gender is, how toxic so many  of its traits are, how oppressive it has been throughout all of space  and time.  That despite her obvious reality, she lives in a world of  abundant privilege.  See come to find out, everyone actually treats her  better because of she is a she.  Theres no shit, a Boys Are Wonderful  effect.. like scientifically fucking proven....but nonono its girls that  are treated the best.  Theres no data to confirm this (quite the  opposite).... its just so.  Theres really no data for almost any of this  at all.\n\n# Further, that she needs  to be an ally to boys and help them all she can.  Even though a not so  quiet part of them really do chant \"Killallwomen\" and \"female tears  sustain me\"....just ignore that.\n\n# And  when she raises any point, however timid about how none of this matches  her lived experiences.....well she is struggling with her femininity  and God help us if she finds a video on the internet by a professor who  may say she isnt a goddamn monster.\n\n# What a backwards fucking world that would be huh?\n\nI will also add, rough and tumble play and rough housing - the type of play fathers do - is critical for boys and girls development, it is especially important in boys.... its has really wide reaching benifits, e.g. confidence, emotional regulation, behaviour management.... this is done by father usually and mothers usually do not do this type of play.\n\nThe combination of fatherlessness, less fathers in childcare, and absence of men in teaching as well as the health and safety culture in education (bad combination with an already feminised work force too) all adds up to really missing out for boys.\n\nHere is importance of rough housing:\n\n[https://youtu.be/QAbkUpVfkTs](https://youtu.be/QAbkUpVfkTs)\n\n[https://youtu.be/ryVSS0q2FCM](https://youtu.be/ryVSS0q2FCM)\n\nThis is also a tip for all the fathers and uncles etc out there.... this is excellent to know for your sons/ daughters etc that thist type of play is really good for them\n\nI am much more hands on in play with nephew now and I notice how easy it is to manage his behaviour now, how much he aboslutely adores playing with me now, whereas previously no one could get him still to change clothes (well his father could!), go in car seat, I can easily do it now, his behaviour is good etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nComment in Guardian post linked above:\n\nTo clarify a few points raised:\n\n\\- In our first study, (not me im copying/pasting this) we found that girls from Reception (aged 4  or 5) and boys from Year 3 (aged 7 or 8) thought that girls were  superior students to boys in every way.  This included perceptions of  conduct, motivation, achievement, and even intellectual ability. This  latter finding surprised us - we find it rather shocking and sad that  boys this age have picked up this self-effacing stereotype.- In addition to this stereotype, our first study  uncovered what's known as a \"meta-stereotype\": not only do kids think  girls are better students, they believe adults think so, too.- These \"meta-stereotypes\" are important because  previous research has shown that they can be self-fulfilling.  Kids can  become anxious because they are aware that they are expected to perform  badly, on the basis of the social group to which they belong (e.g.,  race, class, and in this case, gender).  This is know as \"stereotype  threat\" .  As a result, \"experimental groups\" of kids who are reminded  of such expectations do worse than \"control groups\" of kids who are not.- Indeed, this is what we found in our second study.   Being reminded of the general expectancy that girls will do better  harmed boys' performance in SATs-type tests.  Notably, it did NOT boost  girls' performance.  From this, we can provisionally conclude that the  stereotypes in question harm boys, academically, without benefitting  girls.  By implication, undoing or neutralizing these expectations ought  (in principle) to help boys, without compromising girls' achievement.- We did NOT examine where these expectations and  anxieties come from.  We have no data to suggest, for example, that it  is teachers' fault. On the contrary, in our experience teachers bend  over backwards to be inclusive and fair. Rather, we are inclined to  believe that widely shared social stereotypes of gender are more  important. Pre-school and out-of-school experiences are likely to be  very powerful shapers of gender stereotypes.- Nonetheless, schools are an obvious place to start if  we want to break the \"spell\" of the stereotype that boys are inferior  students.  One thing that we are beginning to try is simply  communicating to boys and girls that we do not expect them to perform  differently. (Note: this is not the same thing as telling them that they  are the same in any other way, be it culturally or biologically.) In  any case we hope our research will stimulate debate and especially  creative solutions to the problem that boys seem to be facing.- Note that we would not suggest for a second that  stereotypes are the only reason that on average, boys tend to struggle  at most age groups and in most subjects, relative to girls.  We are just  trying to identify one piece in the puzzle.- Also, of course, in some subjects and in some  contexts boys go on to do better, as in the highest levels of  Nobel/Fields lists.  Many (including us, as it happens) would also argue  that later in life, men are advantaged relative to women.  It's  tempting therefore to conclude that the gender gap at school is not a  big deal.  But our view is that any arbitrary and avoidable limitation  on the potential of any group in society ultimately costs us all.  It is  also our view - a point of value rather than science - that we should  not view gender relations as a zero-sum game; that men's  underachievement is a kind of victory or compensation for women, for  example.  And therefore, we find it a problem that although men are  over-represented in many fields of excellence, they are also  over-represented in the field of academic failure.  We hope our research  will one day help give boys a lift and therefore help everyone.- That said, we don't claim that our work is  ground-breaking - we are simply applying the well-demonstrated concept   of \"stereotype threat\" to try to help  understand what's causing boys  and girls to perform differently.  It's \"applied\" rather than \"pure\"  research.  And certainly, our work says little or nothing about whether  girls and boys should be schooled separately, taught in the same way, or  by men, and so on.- However, there is one general moral that I hope  people take away from our research, as from much of the social  psychological research that it follows.   Stereotypes (of say race,  class, and gender) have a way - myriad ways - of fulfilling themselves.   They don't require that parents, teachers, or the media explicitly tell  a certain group that certain things are expected of them.  Thus we  should not conclude from the poor performance, disadvantaged position,  bad conduct or even low IQ scores of any group that it is innately or  inevitably inferior.\n\n&#x200B;",

The reason was that there was a huge lack of science teachers so anyone graduating in a science subject was encouraged to consider science teaching.\n\nOne credit I took was called ' Gender differentials in education',. It was given by a fat leftist female professor who proclaimed that she was a radical feminist. It was an optional unit and in a class of 50 and we were just 2 men.\n\nThe professor often picked on me. For example I'd whisper something to my neighbour and the professor would pounce on me and tell me ' Please share that with the class' (It was something personal) and I replied that I'd rather not. \"I knew it\" she spat out. \"It was a sexist joke\".  I do not know how she made this jump in logic.\n\nWe were taught to use examples that appealed to women when teaching physics (as it is the only hard science where women have not penetrated too much). So we were discouraged from using speeding cars, bullets, skate boards, billiard balls etc when teaching momentum. We were encouraged to use 'gender neutral' examples which included cutlery (when explaining electroplating), a runaway stroller when explaining acceleration and ice skating when explaining momentum.\n\nAt the end of the credit, we were to be judged by performing a study and submitting the results. I chose to ask permission from 2 schools and observe a class of boys and a class of girls while they were being taught physics. I observed differences and I wrote down my results, quoted my sources and gave my interpretation. I was horrified to see that I got an F - I am not sure whether other people understand what an F means. It means FAILURE. It does not mean low quality work - but work that is so bad that does not even merit a grade.\n\nI went to complain to the professor and explain to her how I had carried out my work and she ended up telling me \"I don't feel like changing your mark'.\n\nThat was the first time I told a professor FUCK YOU!\n\nThis idiotic but cruel radical feminist had missed the chance of having a young man (me) join the field of feminists and made an enemy of feminazis for life.",

    "text": "A member asked here, \"How do we know that the statistics on 97% and 1/3 of women have been sexually assaulted are false?\" here is the full answer, with all the links to all the studies. Read and disseminate.   \n\n# Some Feminist Readers May Want to Sit Before Continuing\n\n [April 26, 2021](https://lovists.com/2021/04/26/some-feminist-readers-may-want-to-sit-before-continuing/) [Henry Blair](https://lovists.com/author/henryblair/)   \n\nIs the attack against sexual  communication and the language of sexuality justified? Is the position  of women in sexual relations with men so abusive, desperate, and violent  that the step taken by feminism – disqualifying almost the entire  language – should be endorsed even if the price is a cessation of human  sexuality between the sexes?\n\nFeminist women and  feminism-sympathizers have absolute confidence that the answer is an  unequivocal yes: the feminist belief is that all women were sexually  injured and that all men sexually harass, if not in practice then  potentially, if not directly then indirectly in creating an environment  that encourages harassment. Feminists see this as a plain, clear picture  of reality that is easy to establish. The problems begin when one  attempts to do just that.\n\nIn 2015, [the Journal of Public Health published a study](https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/39/4/738/2298455)  that was conducted in Spain and included 10,171 women. The researchers,  all women themselves, contacted randomly-sampled women to avoid data  bias, and performed in-person interviews with each of the thousands of  participants to find out if they had experienced assault or harassment,  from rape to “Has anyone touched you sexually, or did anything else  sexually that you did not want.” In case the women weren’t comfortable  answering verbally, the interviewers offered to point to cards. It is  important to emphasize that the study addressed assaults and harassment  from any person of any type of acquaintance, except for a spouse  (regarding sexual assaults by spouses, according to the World Health  Organization, [the prevalence](https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap6.pdf)  ranges between 3% and 11% in the West and reaches up to 40% in small  tribal communities in Latin America where weddings between minors are  frequent).\n\nSome feminist readers may want to sit  before continuing: the results were that a total of 7.2% of women  reported some form of rape or harassment of the types examined.  Specifically, out of 10,171 participants, 1.4% went through an offense  of rape of any kind by a man of any acquaintance, 2.8% have experienced  attempted assault that did not end in rape, and 5.6% reported some form  of sexual harassment. We should pay attention to a crucial aspect of the  data that will later take on dramatic significance: when we mentioned  how many of the women reported each type of event, we got the numbers  1.4% plus 2.8% plus 5.6%, which when added up give 9.8%. But it was  written here that overall, 7.2% of women reported some form of assault  or harassment. Not 9.8%. How is it possible? This happens because there  are ***overlaps*** between the groups. Some women  who reported a particular type of incident, also reported another type  and are included in both groups. If we were to calculate the total  number of women who experienced any kind of wrongdoing by adding the  percentage of the second group to that of the first group, women  appearing in both would be counted twice, and we will not arrive at the  percentage of individuals who reported some kind of incident. We would  get the wrong percentage – a higher one. Therefore, the researchers  reported the total percentage of women who went through any kind of  event. Only the researchers themselves could have reached this figure;  it cannot be derived from simply reading the percentages of the  different events. In order to reach this total, the researchers had to  calculate the percentage of affirmative questionnaires out of all  questionnaires. If the researchers had not reported the result, we  wouldn’t be able to arrive at it ourselves because we have no way of  knowing the overlap between the percentages of the different groups.\n\nIf the figure 7.2% seems surprising compared to the information you may have heard, you may want to remain seated. Because in [a study published in 2014 in the Lancet](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673613622436),  one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the world,  researchers conducted a review (meta-analysis) of 7,231 different  studies that examined the percentage of women who have been sexually  assaulted or harassed, excluding incidents from a spouse. This is not a  mistake, these are seven thousand, two hundred, and thirty-one different  studies. The summary of the studies reached the following figure: 7.2%.\n\nThe critical reader will quickly turn  to the possibility that the studies rely on legal definitions, which  would entail omitting harassment that women experience during their  lives but supposedly is not reported in the studies. The chances that  this explains the figure 7.2% are extremely low: the definitions of  harassment in such studies, usually refer to the interviewee’s  subjective experience (“have you felt harassed”) and not to any rigid  definition taken from criminology or the law, nor to whether a complaint  was filed or legal actions taken. For example, the purpose of the  Spanish study was to examine the long-term psychological impact of  harassment and sexual assault. It was a study in Psychology, which takes  no interest in criminology or legal definitions. Most studies on the  prevalence of harassment, such as those included in the Lancet review,  are of this type. They ask about those events that women experienced as  harassment and, most of the time, do not limit themselves at all to what  the law defines as criminal. Still, feminists will have a hard time  digesting the figure 7.2%. They may demand that new studies will be  performed, with some broader definitions of harassment. Fortunately to  them, these studies have already been carried out. \n\nIn 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the US published [a study conducted by telephone in 2010 among 16,507 respondents](https://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/NISVS_Report2010-a.pdf), in order to assess the prevalence of harassment and rape in women and men, and [published again](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4692457/.%20Accessed%20December%2027,%202020)  in 2014 findings from 2012. The study is particularly interesting  because of the way the questions were worded and how harassment and  sexual assault were defined. Unlike in most studies, participants were  not asked, “have you been assaulted” or “were you harassed.” Instead, ***situation-descriptions***  were given. Respondents were asked, for example, “How many people have  you had sex with after they pressured you by… lies, (or) making promises  about the future?”, “How many people have you had sex with after they  pressured you by… showing they were unhappy?” or whether they had sex  “when you were drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to  consent.” If the respondent answered in the affirmative on the last  question, the interviewer recorded that she was raped, and an  affirmative answer on the other two was recorded as sexual violence.  Non-physical harassment was similarly defined with the broadest  definitions. Did this study support the feminist assertion that 100% of  women were harassed?\n\nThe findings of the 2014 study (the  2011 study presented similar data) were that in total, 43.9% of women  reported incidents that the study defined as types of non-rape  harassment. Specifically, 32.1% answered in the affirmative on questions  defined as non-physical harassment (exposure, nudity, verbal harassment  in public), 27.3% responded affirmatively on questions defined as  physical harassment (“Caressing, cornering, grasping or touching in a  way that made you feel insecure”), and 12.5% answered in the affirmative  to questions defined as verbal coercion to sex, including with  dishonesty or sadness, defined as sexual violence (the three categories  are contained in the number 43.9 but do not add up to it, because of the  overlaps between groups). Regarding rape and attempted rape, a total of  19.3% answered in the affirmative to questions defined in the study as  sexual assault. Specifically, out of all the participants, 11.5%  answered in the affirmative to questions that according to the study  definitions indicate they had been raped, and 6.4% answered in the  affirmative to questions defined in the study as attempted rape.  Finally, 8.8% reported being sexually assaulted by a spouse. These last  three figures together add up to 19.3%, as mentioned earlier. Also, all  sex under the influence of alcohol or drugs was categorized as rape,  constituting 9.3% included in the figure 19.3%. \n\nRegrettably, the CDC researchers did  not publish how the figures of 43.9 and 19.3 are summed up. They did not  report the overall percentage of women who experienced any form of  assault or harassment. This is at least 43.9% (full overlap between  categories) and at most 63.2% (complete lack of overlap – that is, no  woman in the study was harassed in two or more ways). The two extreme  states do not appear in reality in studies, so the sum is likely to  range between the two values – possibly around 50%, that is, that 50% of  women were sexually harassed or attacked. If one wishes to compare this  figure to the 7.2% that 7,231 studies have reached, it’s necessary to  add sexual assaults by a spouse, because these were studies that focused  on incidents from any person other than a  spouse. The prevalence of  incidents caused by a spouse can be found, for example, in the World  Health Organization figures mentioned above, pointing to [3% to 11% in the West](https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap6.pdf).  When added to 7.2%, these incidence rates reach an overall prevalence  of between 11% and 18% (this addition is done under the stricter  assumption of no-overlap, so the actual sum can only be lower). No  doubt, if 11-18% of all women have gone through any kind of sexual  harassment or assault, from the mildest possible verbal innuendo to  actual rape, this is a high figure, but it is still very far from the  50% arguably reported by the CDC. Which is more reliable? The finding  reached by 7,231 studies, or the CDC’s?\n\nShortly after their release, the two CDC studies were criticized in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/cdc-study-on-sexual-violence-in-the-us-overstates-the-problem/2012/01/25/gIQAHRKPWQ_story.html?utm_term=.38d6accfbd38), by prof. Christina Hoff Sommers (who also runs a very revealing YouTube channel, called [The Factual Feminist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLytTJqkSQqtpB1YvQFdEEdAtYO3qg7fow)) and in [Time magazine](https://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers/)  by Dr. Kathy Young. Both have wondered if the CDC’s questions  distinguished at all between women who were harassed, and women who were  in consensual situations. Because, in order to reach the figure of  around 50%, the researchers defined any sexual relations under the  influence of alcohol or drugs, as rape (9.3%). There were no follow-up  questions – just a phone call asking the respondents if they had sex  “when you were drunk, high, drugged, ***or*** passed out and unable to consent” – the ***Or*** made  the statement just as true for those who were not passed out but that  had a drink. The question could very well receive an affirmative answer  from those who would not think of themselves as assaulted in any way,  but have responded that at least once in their life, they had sex after  drinking. Due to the wording of the questions, there is a very likely  possibility that women who drank a few glasses of wine in a restaurant  and slept with their husband or boyfriend were counted as raped. In the  same manner, any verbal persuasion for having sex, including lying and  expressing sadness, was counted as sexual harassment (12.5%), so a woman  who slept with a man only to find out a week later that he was married,  would be counted as harassed because she was lied to, even if she was  married herself and lied as well to the man she was with, and may have  felt angry, but not necessarily sexually harassed. Non-physical  harassment, which reached 32.1%, included showing and taking nude  photos, so teens who voluntarily exchanged photos with their boyfriends  were most likely considered harassed because the researchers only asked,  “How many people have ever… made you look at or participate in sexual  photos or movies?” (the rest of the sentence – “against your will”, did  not exist in the study). \n\nUnlike studies that reach 7.2%, the CDC study did not ask anyone, “were you harassed.” Instead, the researchers formulated ***situation-descriptions***,  thinking only of the negative examples for each description and not of  the positive ones. As a result, very innocent situations that also fit  the same rigid situation-description (having a drink before sex,  exchanging photos for fun) should have been counted as violent  incidents, making it extremely plausible that some proportion of those  who responded in the affirmative, were women and men who did not feel  harassed at all and yet counted as such. This is probably the most  plausible explanation for the gap between 11-18% reached by thousands of  studies, and the 40-60% reached by the CDC, whose creators were  associated by the commentators with radical feminism.\n\nImportantly, studies reporting 7.2%  assaulted and harassed, also record much less rape cases than the  numbers commonly used in public discourse today. For example, the  Spanish study found the number to be 1.4% of women. What is then the  source of expressions such as “one in five” (20%) and “one in four”  (25%), that are being spread? Even the CDC study reached 11.5% assault  incidents, not 1 in 5 or 1 in 4, and this figure was obtained with rigid  situation-descriptions that probably counted many who were not  assaulted, thus artificially increasing the actual number. Where did the  feminist belief in extraordinary figures 20 times higher than the data  come from? One possibility is that the number comes from biased samples.  Feminism-sympathizers run internal surveys, but without minding  methodological considerations such as random sampling, that are  necessary for the results to apply to the entire population and not just  to the site where respondents were recruited. For example, in such  surveys, feminism-sympathizers may approach women in places where rape  rates are exceptionally high, such as busy city centers, and then report  the findings as applying to the entire population (in fact, one  gender-studies department published instructions to its teachers and  students not to apply random sampling, but to focus on “interesting  cases,” which amounts to intentionally introducing a sampling bias that  would render results uninterpretable). Another explanation might be that  feminism-sympathizers summed up percentages of different categories  (from the same research or even from different studies). If done while  ignoring the overlap between groups, this would cause an error that  inflates the numbers. Another likely possibility is that feminists  applied the same way of thinking of the CDC investigators, of defining  rigid situation-descriptions, and counting as assault the categories  that studies created in their questionnaires, because the sympathizers  decided that a question is a rigid situation-description that  constitutes an assault, without having access to the respondents to  verify this. \n\nThe feminist statement that all women  were harassed was formulated only very recently, and as part of a  broader endeavor, to convince in a different claim – that all men have  harassed women, directly or indirectly. Notably, even if it ***would*** have  been true that every women was sexually harassed, this would not  necessitate that all men have harassed because such a result could just  as well ensue from a small number of men harassing all women. That is,  even if “all women were harassed” ***was*** a true  proposition, it would not entail in any way that “all men have  harassed”. However, this plain fact was missed entirely by feminists,  who, believing in the logical fallacy that if all women were harassed  then all men have harassed, aspire to reach 100% harassed first and  foremost, to show, basically, that all men are guilty. \n\nThe feminist motivation to show that  all men are guilty by attempting to show that all women were harassed  continues to grow. The use of arbitrary situation-descriptions without  ever inquiring “were you harassed”, that is, without taking interest in  personal will, thus forcing on respondents a negative interpretation of  innocent experiences, has become ever more popular since Me Too. In  feminism, the situation-descriptions expanded to encompass almost all of  daily life, until nearly every human interaction between men and women  may be regarded as harassment, [the greeting “hello” included](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/when-did-hello-become-har_b_6173284). This forcing of situation-descriptions on interactions to count them as offenses, enabled recent pseudo-research [to conclude that 81%](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/21/587671849/a-new-survey-finds-eighty-percent-of-women-have-experienced-sexual-harassment) and even [97% of women](https://mashable.com/article/sexual-harassment-un-women-uk/)  were sexually harassed.  Feminism-sympathizers joined the efforts and  apply voluntarily the new situation-descriptions to their own lives to  count innocent interactions as “harassment”. Just recently the New York  Times reported that [Gov. Andrew Cuomo was accused by an assistant](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/nyregion/alyssa-mcgrath-cuomo-harassment.html)  of sexual harassment because “he inquired about her lack of a wedding  ring”, “him telling her she was beautiful — in Italian”, and once “gazed  down her shirt and commented on a necklace”. All along, what drives  this ever-increasing expansion of the definitions of harassment by  situation-descriptions that become more and more arbitrary, is the  relentless aspiration to point a blaming finger at all men, to argue,  “all men are guilty”. \n\nThus we arrive at the underlying  question that drives this entire discussion – how many men have actually  sexually harassed women? While there are plenty of studies assessing  how many women were harassed, it is difficult to find ones that examine  what percentage of men out of all men behave in a harassing way. Still,  my searches led me to [a 2013 study performed in the United States](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/1748355)  with a thousand young men and women of the ages 14 to 21. And here are  the results: Of the boys and young men, 9% have harassed – far from the  notion that all or most men engage in such behavior. But the findings  also revealed that the proportion of girls and young women who committed  the same sexual harassment was the same – 9% – and the girls’  harassment was directed primarily, like the boys’, toward the opposite  sex. It is generally very difficult to find studies examining the  question “what percentage of men have sexually harassed,” because ***until recently, this was an absurd question.*** It  was clear to everyone that there is crime in the world, committed by  both men and women, and everyone knew that criminals are a tiny fraction  of humanity. The notion that all men might be criminals, so that  studies should seriously look into the question of “what percentage of  men are criminals,” was unthinkable and therefore almost no studies can  be found that have examined such a question. \n\nSome historians specialize in trying  to understand how a popular error about research facts has been created.  Historians will be able to examine in the future what caused the  feminist false beliefs that all women were harassed, and that one in  five, four or three were raped. In reality, studies that apply a  verified methodology to identify the number of women who have been  raped, reach 1.4%. In the West, another 3% to 11% of women have been  sexually assaulted by a spouse. As for harassment, these studies show  that 5.6% of women have been sexually harassed.  \n\n\nSource and url for sharing: [https://lovists.com/2021/04/26/some-feminist-readers-may-want-to-sit-before-continuing/](https://lovists.com/2021/04/26/some-feminist-readers-may-want-to-sit-before-continuing/)",

Ever heard of manipulating? “Well they were flirting and sexting.” And who’s fault is that? Do you go to other victims and tell them “well why did you wear that skirt? Why were you out at night? Why did you drink the drink he/she gave to you? Why didn’t you scream?” No, you don’t.",

    "text": "Abuse of boys in Australian schools is OK with Australian Human Rights Commission In Australia earlier this year, parents of boys in several Australian schools were shocked when their son's were forced to stand in classes, and public apologise for their masculinity. Two schools were publicly identified (Braurer College, Victoria and Parkdale Secondary College, Victoria). The teachers handing out this abuse were also identified by the schools, and parents were promised the allegations would be investigated, and the issues addressed.\n\nTo date, no-one has been held accountable for this public shaming and abuse of these boys. In addition, the Australian Human Rights Commissioner (Ros Croucher), the Australian Sex Discrimination Commissioner (Kate Jenkins) and the Australian National Children's Commissioner (Megan Mitchell), all women with entrenched misandrist beliefs about toxic masculinity, have done nothing to investigate, and have had nothing to say about these disturbing events. In fact, the Australian Human Rights Commission web site has no record of these events at all, despite both reported events and schools apearing in 100s of news reports over a period of several months.\n\nIt appears that the Australian Human Rights Commission supports and endorses the abuse of boys in Australian Schools, enabling the continuing discrimination against boys in the Australian education system and community generally, while blithely continuing to concentrate on the rights and privileges of women and girls. \n\nPerhaps it's time to appoint a man or woman with less misandrist views to one of these important public offices.",

    "text": "The US-funded (in)voluntary male medical circumcision program and its 20 million victims to date. VMMC stands for Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision.\n\nIt is a totally legitimate and totally medical procedure that is obviously done under informed consent. \n\nAccording to research by researchers and governments who legitimately refer to themselves as the \"VMMC community\" in papers, more than 6 million of such totally consensual procedures had been carried out by 2013 with more than 20 millon planned by 2016 and more than 80% of the ones completed by 2013 having been payed for by:\n\n>the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief [PEPFAR]\n\n>The VMMC program is an ambitious public health intervention. While it is estimated that close to 6 million circumcisions had been completed by the end of 2013, against a goal of 20.2 million by 2016, this progress should be viewed within the context of the recent and rapidly developing understanding of the importance of VMMC as an HIV prevention intervention (Figure 1). (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the reason for what researches refer to as \"the VMMC program\" is the belief that circumcision could prevent 60% of female on male HIV contractions without having to provide education on safer sex practices or female and male condoms. Of course, such a program is claimed to be implemented to help the people, but the justification for choosing a method that, as I will show later on, inevitably lead to gruesome human rights violations was to save money. The estimated savings were more than 16 billion in treatment costs with the VMMC program wheighing in at only 2 billion without \"demand creation\" - obviously, the \"created demand\" will be totally voluntary, organic and gras fed:\n\n>Furthermore, the choice to be circumcised involves deep-seated values, beliefs, and motivational factors that vary with ethnic, religious, and cultural identities, and must be addressed effectively to generate demand for circumcision. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/) \n\nOf course, the surgeries are not the only, nor the most effective way to prevent HIV. But with almost 14 Billion in total savings, it is the way to make the most money as VMMC is a one-time procedure that provides \"continuous benefits\" without having to continuously invest into further adherence:\n\n>Modeling studies done in 2009–2011 showed that in these 14 priority countries, achieving 80% circumcision prevalence among males aged 15–49 within five years (“catch-up”), and maintaining this coverage rate in subsequent years (“sustainability”), could avert 3.4 million new HIV infections within 15 years and generate treatment and care savings of US$16.5 billion [7],[8]. **VMMC is a highly cost-effective HIV prevention strategy for both generalized and high-prevalence HIV epidemics [7]. It differs from most other prevention methods (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis, sexual behavior change, or condom use) in that it only requires a one-time action in order to provide continuous benefits.**[...]\n\n>A major limitation of the cost studies in this collection is that they do not include the costs of demand creation nor analyze how increased spending on demand creation might affect the actual demand for services.[...]\n\n>The program faces increasing competition for declining funding for HIV prevention and treatment. The funding need for VMMC remains significant, and continued evidence-based advocacy is necessary to secure funds for accelerated scale-up from a broad base of donors. One way to do this is to evaluate the population-level impact of those VMMC programs that have already been scaled up. Another is to continue to draw comparisons between VMMC and other HIV prevention programs, highlighting specifically that if VMMC coverage reaches the JSAF goal of 80%, it will prove the **most cost-effective and cost-saving HIV prevention intervention** in Eastern and Southern Africa. In addition, it **does not require sustained adherence**, and there is evidence that referrals made from the VMMC program increase HIV-positive males' access to treatment [32].[...] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\nTotally unfortunately though, they are struggling to reach their goals:\n\n>Despite the rapid implementation and scale-up of VMMC programs and the doubling of the cumulative total VMMC procedures in the past year (from 3.2 million by the end of 2012 to an estimated 5.8–6 million by the end of 2013), progress at the country level has varied widely (Figure 3) and the year-on-year rate of growth in the number of VMMCs performed is declining (Figures 2 and ​and 4). This is due to a combination of factors: the JSAF goal of reaching 80% of uncircumcised men by 2016 did not fully take into account country-specific constraints that have tempered the pace of scale-up, **lack of sufficient demand**, and insufficient funding from a broad base of international donors (the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief [PEPFAR] has funded more than 80% of circumcisions to date). Modeling suggests that even if the current growth rate is maintained and adequate funds are forthcoming, the number of VMMCs completed by 2016 would fall about 3 million short of the JSAF goal of 20.2 million (Figure 4). (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\nSo what do you do? What is this \"demand creation\"?\n\nLet's see:\n\n>Demand creation: Messaging must be tailored to different age groups and to the cultural norms of different communities. Men aged 25 and above are less motivated to undergo VMMC. Studies suggest that we need to go beyond simple HIV messaging and present VMMC in terms of hygiene, appearance, attractiveness to partners, peer group norms, and modernity. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\nIn other terms, stigmatize being uncurcumcized as ugly, dirty and unattractive, incite bullying, make them self-conscious and ultimately psychologically break them into totally voluntarily undergoing the ~~assault~~ surgery.\n\nI mean, they totally look at the human and their needs as ~~victims of coercion~~ \"users\":\n\n>While a large portion of this collection focuses on surgical efficiency or quality [9]–[12], the bigger challenge is overall programmatic efficiency. The challenge of scale-up can be approached as a management challenge that requires addressing each element of the delivery value chain (the specific activities that deliver the end product to the user), using time and resources appropriately, and matching supply with demand for VMMC services while working to increase both.[...]\n\n>The cost of circumcision devices and other supply chain costs must be brought down considerably if devices are to reduce overall program costs. This will require advocacy as well as negotiation with manufacturers and suppliers in tandem with demand-creation activities. We recommend further study to ascertain whether devices make circumcision more attractive to men and to understand whether devices could assist with balancing supply and demand to help achieve needed programmatic efficiencies. It is also important to tailor demand-creation activities for devices in order to reach those who may already be aware of circumcision's benefits but who have avoided conventional surgical methods.[...]\n\n>To date little research has looked at the male population as a market of consumers of an intervention with multiple benefits. A market research approach, along with insights from diverse fields such as behavioral economics and anthropology, can provide new tools to inform the development of new approaches. More funding should be allocated to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the many approaches to creating and mobilizing demand. Those that show positive results should be taken to scale. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\nBy now, by the way, we are in the next stage and already target boys down to the age of 10 (and below, as I will show later on): \n\n>It is important to begin strategizing for the sustainability phase that should follow the present “catch-up” activities. It will take time to determine the best approach to sustaining high MC prevalence in each country, develop global and national frameworks, secure resources, and implement long-term programs. Since the cohorts prioritized in the sustainability phase will likely be some combination of uncircumcised boys (aged 10−14 years) and infants (aged 0−60 days), it will also be important to explore how best to reach young adolescents and parents of infants, taking into account impact, cost, the feasibility of scale-up, cultural acceptability, and other factors. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\nSo let's look at some actual approaches for ~~coercing~~ promoting ~~mutilation~~ demand.\n\n>Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) programs in Africa have significantly altered social norms related to male circumcision among previously non-circumcising groups and groups that have practiced traditional (non-medical) circumcision. One consequence of this change is the stigmatization of males who, for whatever reason, remain uncircumcised. This paper discusses the ethics of stigma with regard to uncircumcised adolescent males in global VMMC programs, particularly in certain recruitment, demand creation and social norm interventions. Grounded in our own experiences gained while conducting HIV-related ethics research with adolescents in Kenya, we argue that use of explicit or implicit stigma to increase the number of VMMC volunteers is unethical from a public health ethics perspective, particularly in campaigns that leverage social norms of masculinity. (https://academic.oup.com/phe/article-abstract/14/1/79/6134846)\n\n>The objective of this study was to explore norms of masculinity and the decision-making process among Luo young men to provide a better understanding of how circumcision and masculinity relate to cultural norms within this community. The methodology consisted of eight FGDs with male peer groups and 24 in-depth interviews to elicit young men's perceptions of masculinity and voluntary medical male circumcision. Findings from thematic analysis reveal that young men described several key characteristics of masculinity including responsibility, bravery and sexual attractiveness. For some young men, voluntary medical male circumcision has embedded itself into cultural norms of masculinity by being a step in the transition from boyhood to manhood and by being a marker of some of these masculine characteristics. In the case of voluntary medical male circumcision, there may be opportunities to integrate other programming that helps men transition into healthy adulthood.(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345920045_Integration_of_voluntary_male_medical_circumcision_for_HIV_prevention_into_norms_of_masculinity_findings_from_Kisumu_Kenya)\n\n>There is a need to identify key barriers and facilitators to VMMC uptake in priority countries to improve uptake. In this paper, we report findings from a systematic review of the barriers and facilitators of VMMC uptake, comparing them across countries in order to provide programmers critical information to design effective VMMC uptake interventions. Our review followed PRISMA protocol. Twenty three articles from 10 of the 14 priority countries were included. The top three barriers cited were: MC negatively perceived as being practiced by other or foreign cultures and religions, fear of pain caused by the procedure, and perceptions of VMMC as not helpful/needed. The top four facilitators cited in most countries were: Belief that VMMC reduces health risks and improves hygiene, family and peer support of MC, and enhanced sexual performance and satisfaction.(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324780087_Systematic_review_of_barriers_and_facilitators_to_voluntary_medical_male_circumcision_in_priority_countries_and_programmatic_implications_for_service_uptake)\n\nNote that \"peer support\" and \"peer educators\" are very euphemistic terms, given what they actually describe:\n\n>Many circumcised respondents, especially the younger men, relayed stories of peer-influence in their decision to get circumcised:\n>\"*There was a friend of mine who had decided to go for circumcision and told me, ‘Let’s go and circumcise. How can we continue like this and let other people ridicule us?’ The fear of ridicule from age-mates [already circumcised] influenced our decision.*\" (Circumcised man, age 35)\n>Similarly, some uncircumcised men in the more peri-urban areas, said they would be more likely to “go for the cut” if their peers had been circumcised. [...] Social network influences on VMMC uptake are relatively unexplored [28], although the use of peer educators is widespread in VMMC programming. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011674/)\n\nStudies with these populations have exposed numerous problems, for example the fact that the ~~victims~~ \"clients\" have to be turned in by certain groups of \"mobilizers\" and \"peer educators\" for them to collect money that was put on their heads:\n\n>For mobilizers especially, monthly remuneration (and their future employment) depends on referring enough clients to the clinic each week; failing means earning less, regardless of the amount of time and effort invested in mobilization. From our interviews we learned that while most mobilization supervisors receive a base salary from their IPs regardless of the targets, other lower-level, subcontracted “associate” mobilizers or “peer educators” only receive payment by providing clients and meeting targets. [...]. (This and following quotes without links are from here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337027391_Voluntary_medical_male_circumcision_for_HIV_prevention_among_adolescents_in_Kenya_Unintended_consequences_of_pursuing_service-delivery_targets)\n\nOne mobilization supervisor said:\n\n>And you know, when there are zero clients cut, all the pressure comes to the mobilization supervisor because the surgeons will be saying, ‘We are ready to cut, where are the clients?’ So the buck stops on me as the mobilizer; so it is not a very easy task.\n\nAnother:\n\n>Likewise, a 30-year-old, female mobilization supervisor offered, “We bank on schools so much. And now, when they are taking their exams, you can’t pick a child from school [. . ..] . . .when schools are so engaged, then definitely I will not meet that target” [Mobilizer 4].\n\nThe pressure to meet targets leads to numerous ways of coercing, pushing or otherwise making people undergo the procedure:\n\n>Data collected during interviews and observations suggest that the drive to meet targets may lead some VMMC mobilizers to use misleading or otherwise questionable mobilization practices to increase the number of adolescents they can refer for circumcision. As Mobilizer 1 explained: \"*Another thing is the peer mobilizers, yeah, someone wants to meet his or her targets and that is the time that they engage in what I called the uncouth methods, whereby the end justifies the means; whichever means that can make those clients come out. So you end up having the clients coming, but they are not coming for the VMMC the way we want it. They have been pushed; they have been coerced. . .yeah. This one is happening because of these targets. So that is the downside of the targets.*\" These practices are sometimes blatant: during one door-to-door village mobilization, the mobilizer kept referring to himself as “doctor” although he had no medical training. Another mobilizer, a 38-year-old male who referred to himself as a “VMMC champion” explained how he pays boys to help him mobilize their friends: \"*For us we are calling it ‘broking [brokering] system’. So after the exercise, you tell him to go. . . and convince a friend and bring a friend. . . [. . .]. For me I am using my own system being that we are not even allowed to give children money. But for me, because I have a target, and if I get my target, I am expecting 10800 KES [108 USD]. So I do divide this 10800 KES; maybe if he brings me two boys, I can give him up to 50 KES. I can even give out 100 KES [1 USD]. The moment I give that money, 50 bob, to that boy, he is going to bring me more four boys. So the more he bring boys for instance if they are four, I give 100–150 KES. At the end of the day, I will hit my target*\" [Mobilizer 5].\n\nThey also perform skits in which they try to stigmatize foreskin:\n\n>Other times, these practices are subtle and easy to overlook. During a promotional skit in which mobilizers played the roles of a husband, wife, and brother all discussing VMMC, the message to the audience was one of strong female preference for circumcised men. The wife told her husband, “Go and cut your firimbi [whistle] . . . go and remove that sleeve of a sweater. That whistle is not going inside me. . .don’t blow the whistle inside me. I have refused. . .. I am not giving you [sex].” Later, when the husband’s brother arrived, he explained that his wife is refusing to have sex. In response, his brother said, “I was passing here to tell you to go for circumcision. Look at me, I have gone, and I am fine. I am now a clean person.” Explaining the benefits, his brother offered that MC reduces HIV risk by 60% and enhances cleanliness (“you avoid smelling”) and prevents cervical cancer.\n\nThat being said, I want to explicitly distance myself from the author's statements claiming this to be \"subtle\" and even framing it as merely \"unbalanced humor\" later on:\n\n>While we recognize that the promotional skits used during VMMC “roadshows” use humor and dramatize promotional messages to accentuate the positive, greater efforts should be made to ensure that this messaging is balanced so that benefits and risks are neither over- or understated. For similar reasons, the practice of public health workers persuading boys to become circumcised by claiming that their future female partners will definitely prefer them that way (and reject them if they are not) [45] should be questioned if not discouraged.\n\nI strongly disagree. As long as uncircumcised men are in any way stigmatized, the resulting willingness to undergo such a prcedure may not actually be based on personal preferences rather than an attempt to avoid social sanctions. In fact, the abovementioned alterations of social norms may act as a coercive force even if these practices were completely abandoned, let alone only \"balanced\". It doesn't surprise me though, given that according to netflix, telling men with small dicks to go kill themselves already is \"balanced humor\". Outsourcing the coercion to peers does not change the inherent conflicts associated with not wanting to get circumcised whilst not wanting to get bullied or even attacked for being incorrectly held responsible for all HIV infections that will inevitably occur until education and supply of proper prevention methods is ensured.  You can stop claiming to be a doctor, you can stop using material incentives to persuade those who are easy to manipulate - but you can't just revert the social changes and misinformation (as shown later: only uncircumcised men contract HIV; the only prevention method is circumcision) which induce the creation of pressure by people whom you have no control over. The damage is done and may be irreversible. \n\nAnother way of coercion is paying them with food and clothing:\n\n>According to interviewees, food, money, water, sanitation, clothing, and other basic needs are issues of concern for many adolescents’ households. During health talks, some mobilizers emphasized the incentives that boys will receive (e.g., sodas and/or new underwear) following circumcision—items that may be significant inducements among impoverished children. During a village mobilization effort, one mother explained her reluctance to let her son be circumcised: “. . .*this one is small. Even his heart was there because those who have come from circumcision are ‘seducing’ their friends to go also. They are telling them, ‘go and it is not painful.’* [OP: Remember boys are paid to seduce their friends.]  *They are also giving people sodas. So that soda is what brings them nearer. I told this boy not to sneak, but to wait and I will take him there*. . ..” Offering a similar analysis, Provider 3 told us: \"*Sometimes they also entice them for us; in the facility we give them a bottle of soda, Fanta to be specific because one, some of the boys come probably from poor families, they haven’t had a meal in the morning or breakfast and sometimes stay in the clinic for more than two hours, three hours and thus to maintain their sugars. [But] that one [soda] becomes a bait, especially for the young ones ‘We will give you a soda; we pick you with a vehicle’ . . .which is actually wrong because, it is like enticing a client which you are not supposed to, but that is how they [mobilizers] ply their trade.*\" However, according to our interviewees and as we observed first hand, clinics sometimes lack sodas and/or underwear to give to clients.\n\nA common theme here is the incitation of social stigma and peer pressure:\n\n>All six of the teachers we interviewed recognized social pressure as a primary motivator for MC among adolescents. During observations of mobilization activities, we saw firsthand how mobilizers sometimes make use of or encourage peer pressure to promote circumcision, including through the use of abusive and/or stigmatizing language. During a health talk in front of a large group of boys at a primary school, one male mobilizer referred to foreskins as the “sleeve of a sweater” and “cold matumbo” [boiled goat intestines]; at the end of the talk, he implored those who still had their “whistles” to have them removed. He also told them: “Those who are still having the foreskin, you are the ones who are going to spread the diseases. In the future, you are the ones who are going to spread the HIV virus.” Later that same day, the mobilizer asked a large group of older students,“How many of you wish to get the HIV virus? If you don’t want to get the HIV virus, the only option is to remove the foreskin.” Revealing his awareness of this type of language and messaging within VMMC mobilization, Provider 3 explained: \"*This is demeaning and they try to create some peer pressure. Like when you go to those mass cuts in high schools, probably they registered like 100 clients, you would likely get another probably 30 or so who, because of the peer pressure, just jump into it. But if it was like walking from home to hospital and demanding for the service, they are not likely to have gone. But now that it is here, and so and so has gone and is my friend, I have to be in it.*\"\n\nUnfortunately, the quality of the provided \"surgery\" is lacking as well:\n\n>Under pressure to meet targets, some Clinical Officers and other VMMC medical staff find ways to speed up the clinical process. For example, as we were told during interviews and observed firsthand at multiple VMMC facilities, providers may opt not to take patient medical histories or conduct preoperative examinations (e.g., blood pressure, weight, preexisting conditions, etc.) and/or 30-minute post-operative check-ins, and yet fill in the requisite forms as if these activities had been completed. Other avenues for time-saving include rushing circumcisions, inadequate stitching, splitting surgical utensil and bandage packs between patients, not following recommended protocols or procedures (e.g., the dorsal slit method for circumcision), and stacking patients one after another with little pause in between, which raises additional sanitary and privacy concerns. According to an experienced VMMC surgeon: \"*We cut a lot of corners and I will give you an example: [. . .] so because of speed, you find that while one client is dressing [after circumcision], the other one is [already] undressing. Ideally, it is supposed [to be] that you finish with this client, you give [them] instructions on how to take medication and all that, but because of the high volume, you find that some of us we are not the ones giving out the medication. We assign somebody randomly, you know, who will be giving out the medication and the refreshment and so [the] information [they provide to the client] may not be correct. [. . ..] Sometimes even the vitals of post-operation 30 minutes after [circumcision] are not done. It is skipped, or somebody else does [it]—probably a receptionist who is nonmedical, just to fulfill the requirements of the form. [This] is wrong because you are supposed to do the circumcision and the client rests for 30 minutes in a bed or a couch, then after that, you do the vitals then you discharge. Oh, even the wound care instructions, [that] information may not sink in for the client because it is presented so fast and there may not be [time] for questions. Yeah, there are so many corners we cut. [. . ..] . . .at a clinic last year, I saw them hold that yellow form [medical files] and going through [and just] check, check, check. . . adding blood pressure, adding all these things, just filling them in [without actually measuring blood pressure, etc.]*\". [Provider 3]. One assistant surgeon, a 25-year-old female nurse, claimed her record time for completing a circumcision was six minutes. She too associated VMMC targets with client overload, and with rushing surgeries and an increase in adverse events. She explained: \"*Sometimes you compete cutting clients and the clients are too much. The average time for a client’s [circumcision] is between 12 to 20 minutes. So when the clients are too much, and you want to meet your targets, you will perform the surgery a bit fast. So upon that you will have [an] adverse event and maybe a child will come back with a bleeder [an oozing artery or other blood vessel] you did not close [suture] well*\" [Provider 4].\n\nAnd finally, the guidelines to not accept boys under the age of 10 are regularily ignored:\n\n>Current VMMC for HIV prevention guidelines and national protocols approved for use in Kenya require that adolescent clients must be at least ten years of age.[16] Despite this directive, interviews and observations confirmed that VMMC staff sometimes mobilize and circumcise boys who are under ten years of age in order to boost their numbers to meet targets. When asked about potential links between targets, mobilizer strategies, and underage circumcision, Provider 3 offered: \"*Yes, they bend the rules. . . because you know sometimes our current age according to WHO is 10 years and above. But when they [mobilizers] go to the field and get a nine-year-old for example, they coach this client and the parent, because we insist on seeing the con-sent. We always insist they put the ID and telephone number of the parent [on the consent form]. When they come to the facility, we [call to] confirm the age and whether the parent has consented for the child to be circumcised. And you know, they will tell you ‘yes I am 10 years old’, but when you look at the guy, he is probably 8 or. . .*\" . We observed evidence for the mobilization of underage boys at ten of the 14 VMMC facilities we visited for observation, including boys (and their mobilizers) who readily admitted that they were underage.\n\nThese findings are in line with other research, showing that consent is undervalued and that uncircumcised men report higher rates of depression and a lower quality of life - which you are free to attribute to anything but the incitation of stigma, if you like:\n\n>We identify gaps in the consent process and poor psychosocial outcomes among a key target group: male adolescents. We assessed compliance with consent and assent requirements for VMMC in western Kenya among males aged 15–19 (N = 1939). We also examined differences in quality of life, depression, and anticipated HIV stigma between uncircumcised and circumcised adolescents. A substantial proportion reported receiving VMMC services as minors without parent/guardian consent. In addition, uncircumcised males were significantly more likely than their circumcised peers to have poor quality of life and symptoms of depression.

After all, if these misguided attempts wouldn't have changed societal norms and stigma to a state that makes it practically impossible to differentiate between choice and coercion, nobody would stop anyone from providing accurate information on and a safe execution of voluntary circumcisions.",

    "text": "Some common gender myths and their rebuttals It seems like the same discussions come up around Reddit a lot, so I figured I'd gather up some common topics, and their rebuttals.\n\nMany of these arguments can be expanded with more points and sources but I'm trying to keep this as compact and to the point as possible.\n\n####Myth 1: \"Sexism against men is never institutional or systematic\"\n\nMany forms of sexism and discrimination against men are *explicitly* institutionalized or systemic in society.\n\nExamples include police violence, court biases, incarceration, child custody discrimination, military service, educational biases, health research and spending, insurance, housing discrimination, reproductive rights, bodily autonomy rights, and many others.\n\nThe widespread ignorance and denialism around these issues can itself be interpreted as a form of systemic discrimination against men as well.\n\nNote that some of these are institutional because they boil down to statutory legal rights which exist in the realm of government policy and administration.  And the government is obviously an institution.\n\n#### Myth 2: \"Most politicians and CEOs are men, and this has led to a society that privileges men and disenfranchises women\"\n\nThe fact that many positions of formal power are occupied by men does not translate into measurable privileges for the average man.\n\nThe assumption this is based on is the idea that men have an in-group bias and prefer other men over women.\n\nWhich is an idea that has been debunked over and over again in the academic literature.  The gender bias among men is almost zero, and sometimes manifests as an out-group bias sightly in favor of women, not other men.\n\nIn-group bisses do exist among women though.  In fact some research has found evidence for very strong gender biases among women.  Including when it comes to educators, bosses, and hiring managers.  Women in formal positions of power do actually seem to prefer other women over men, in much the same way that men are accused of behaving. So maybe this is just projection: people who themselves have gender biases assume that everyone else does as well.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15491274\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103101915112\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_9\n\n####Myth 3: \"Women were uniquely oppressed in history compared to men\"\n\nMuch like today, sexism in history was often two sides of the same coin.  If it was unfair that women had to stay home and take care of their children then it was also unfair that men had to work long hours outside the comfort of their homes.  Many people try to equate sexism to the history of racism, as if men were unilaterally oppressing women for their own benefit. And that's simply not an accurate view of history (nor is it a very healthy belief to have).  \n\nGender norms were often unfair to women. But for most of history, women could own property, get divorced (where they usually took most of their husband's money), run businesses, and even be heads of state.  Many large empires were ran by women, for example.\n\nThe reality of the situation though is that pregnancy (and breastfeeding) often dictated the need for women to have men supporting them. Birth control and baby formula didn't exist. So your options were basically abstinence, or marriage. Which was the same choice that men also had.\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books/about/The_Privileged_Sex.html?id=4szznAEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description\n\nhttps://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download_file?file_format=application/pdf&safe_filename=Item.pdf&type_of_work=Journal%20article\n\nhttps://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199582174.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199582174-e-036\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/legalsubjection00baxgoog/\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/beard/woman-force/index.htm\n\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1855/f217b082603d0ab37ea80c4741fceb8a4a23.pdf\n\n**\"What about voting rights?\"**\n\nVoting rights were historically tied to military service and the draft. It was never something that men got \"for free\" just for being men.\n\nIn England, most men couldn't vote until 1918, and that was only because they instituted a draft for all men during WWI.\n\nWomen aged 30 and older were also given the right to vote in 1918, and this came without the same obligation to serve in the military that men had.  Women over 21 were given voting rights just 10 years later in 1928, which was the same age that men could vote.  And that temporary age difference had a practical purposes: so many men died in WW1 that there was a need to even out the gender ratio.\n\nSo men have been allowed to vote for a whopping 10 years longer than women, *at most*.  And that was only because of the mass, involuntary slaughter that they experienced around the world during WW1.\n\nOther obligations that men had were paying taxes, attending caucuses, and signing up for bucket bridges to fight fires.\n\nIt took a few decades in some parts of the world for people to decide that it was fair for women to be able to vote without giving anything back to the state, but I think it's important to understand the context here. It wasn't misogyny or oppression but political theory.  Specifically the question of whether or not it was fair to give women voting rights without equivalent responsibilities that were required from men (something known as a [moral hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard), and that can be contextualized as *\"female privilege also sometimes harming women\"*).\n\nhttps://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/womenvote/parliamentary-collections/collections-the-vote-and-after/representation-of-the-people-act-1918/\n\nhttp://www.familyofmen.com/when-did-men-and-women-have-the-right-to-vote-in-canada/\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/iu2ebj/women_could_and_did_own_property_and_have_rights/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/l1byes/suffrage_was_primarily_a_class_issue_not_a_gender/\n\n####Myth 4: \"Domestic violence and sexual assault are primarily women's issues\"\n\nDomestic violence and sexual assault affects everyone, and at nearly identical rates between men and women.\n\nIn the US, roughly 37.3% of women have been victims of domestic violence, stalking, sexual harassment, and sexual abuse.  Including 1.4 million women who experience sexual assault annually.\n\nFor men that same figure is 30.9%. Including 1.7 million men who experience sexually assault annually (defined as \"made to penetrate\").  The vast majority of these men are also victimized by women, not by \"other men\" (which is another myth).\n\nThis pattern is similar across the world, including in poor and underdeveloped nations (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/koinom/some_sources_on_the_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys/) for a collection of studies), and is consistent with a wide range of research demonstrating \"gender parity\" between men and women for this topic.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf\n\nhttp://webshare.law.ucla.edu/Faculty/bibs/stemple/Stemple-SexualVictimizationPerpetratedFinal.pdf\n\nhttps://1in6.org\n\nIt's also not true that there's a significant difference in severity between male and female victims.  Around 66% of intimate partner homicides do have women as victims (which is hardly a staggering majority), but when you include intimate partner related suicide deaths (including assisted suicides), a greater number of men are killed because of domestic violence than women.  These statistic also ignore the fact that lesbian relationships are more violent than heterosexual and gay male relationships.  Which inflates these numbers and doesn't necessarily back up the idea that women are being uniquely victimized by men.\n\nWe should obviously work to fight against abuse in any form, but our current, gendered approach to this doesn't seem to be helping very much.  It is also commonly used as an excuse for misandry.  Many people who discuss abuse against women do not actually care about female victims.  All they care about is advancing a culture of hatred and sexism against men.\n\nhttps://web.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm\n\nhttps://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.5042/jacpr.2010.0141/full/html\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01506/full\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/f4rvop/some_sources_on_the_severity_of_domestic_violence/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/koinom/some_sources_on_the_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/f5tes5/gender_parity_for_sexual_assault_academic_studies/\n\n**\"But women are afraid to walk down dark alleyways at night!\"**\n\nAs they should.  And as do men.  Most violent crime targets men. And fear is subjective. This is hardly evidence of some kind of unique oppression against women (at least one that doesn't also affect men), and it ignores the fact that men are usually afraid of finding themselves in those same situations as well.\n\nMen are stronger and more capable of defending themselves so I wouldn't blame someone for having gendered views or assumptions here.  But let's try not to minimize male victimization or blame it on things like \"male oppression\".\n\n####Myth 5: \"False allegations are extremely rare\"\n\nMultiple studies have found alarmingly high rates of false allegations in society.\n\nAs many as 1 in 7 men have been falsely accused at some point in their life, and they often have to live with those allegations even after proving their innocence.\n\nIn addition, around 1 in 20 women have also been falsely accused at some point during their life.\n\nFalse allegations are particularly common when it comes to child custody and divorce, where well over half of all allegations have been estimated to be false.  There is also a common racial element that targets minority men.  Especially in history during the era of lynchings in the US.\n\nhttp://www.saveservices.org/dv/falsely-accused/survey/\n\n http://www.prosecutorintegrity.org/pr/survey-over-20-million-have-been-falsely-accused-of-abuse/\n\nhttps://quillette.com/2019/04/16/divorce-and-the-silver-bullet/\n\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/14977/14977-h/14977-h.htm\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/e6w4yc/i_call_bullshit_on_the_false_rape_accusation/\n\n####Myth 6: \"Men commit suicide more often than women, but women still *attempt* suicide more often than men\"\n\nThis idea has its origins with faulty hospital reporting which lumps suicide attempts in with self-harm (which is something that's more common among women).  Women are also more likely to report their suicide attempts than men. And even if this statistic were accurate, it ignores the obvious fact that a suicide survivor can attempt again, thus artificially inflating this statistic.\n\nThe fact is, most suicid deaths are men, and most evidence points to there being more unique attempts by men. Any evidence that men are \"better\" at it than women has been interpreted as evidence for greater motivation of success, due to the very same factors that lead them to attempt suicide to begin with. Not as evidence that women are somehow attempting suicide at rates similar to men in the background.\n\nhttps://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1398-8\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/cvpyve/comment/ey5xeda\n\n####Myth 7: \"Men make more money because of their gender, and this is evidence of male privilege\"\n\nExisting gender norms encourage men to earn money in order to meet the financial demands that are placed on them by women.\n\nThis causes them to work harder and sacrifice more for their careers than women. Which they do in part because their income is tied to how successful they are with women, and whether or not they qualify as \"marriage material\".\n\nThe wage gap is therefore an example of a gender norm that harms men just as much as it does women.\n\n92% of workplace deaths are men. Men work on average an extra 4 to 10 hours a week (depending on your source) than women. They start working at a younger age (often skirting child labor laws). They retire later (which is also during their peak earning years). And they die sooner than women. Men have worse health outcomes than women and that's largely because of the pressures that society puts on them to be successful and earn money to spend on women.\n\nThis is the other side of the wage gap that is equally as important, and that is equally as harmfully to men as it is to women. And it's really just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIn many ways the wage gap is just a reflection of the financial exploitation of men in society.  Which is facilitated by things like hypergamy and unfair marriage and divorce practices.\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/kzvfcg/about_the_wage_gap/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/dxaimc/the_wage_gap_is_created_by_women_and_reflects/\n\n####Myth 8: \"Men don't go to the doctor because of toxic masculinity\"\n\nThe main reason that men sometimes don't seek help is a lack of time to see a doctor.\n\nMen work longer hours than women at jobs that are less flexible, and more stressful, than jobs that women usually work at. [Men overall engage in an extra hour of paid and unpaid labor per day compared to women](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/ft_18-05-01_fathersday_time/), and an extra 45 minutes commuting to jobs that are further away. Meaning men on average have quite a bit less free time to go see a doctor than women do.\n\nThis is also something that changes during retirement: retired men are just as likely to go to the doctor as retired women.\n\nhttps://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e003320\n\nA general lack of help and support, especially financial support, for men who need medical help also contributes to this.  There is a myth that men are better taken care of than women which has resulted in gendered policies that help women, but exclude men.  Even though it's men who often need that help more.\n\n####Myth 9: \"Men don't speak up about sexism as much as women, so it's obviously not as big of an issue\"\n\nThis is because people are less likely to care or listen to them. In part because many men who do speak up are silenced and accused of being misogynistic. A situation known as testimonial injustice or [epistemic oppression](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-epistemic-oppression/).\n\nMen are told to keep quiet and many end up internalizing the idea that only women can be discriminated against, since this is what society tells us to believe.  Instead, men often adopt different terminology when they discuss gender issues.  Like referring to differences in treatment between men and women as \"double standards\" instead of sexism or discrimination.\n\n####Myth 10: \"Most men's issues are caused by men themselves\"\n\nMost men's issues are caused by gender norms and those gender norms are enforced by women just as much as they are by men.\n\nMen's issues are often just one side of the coin, and usually reflect disadvantages that women face as well.\n\nOne of the biggest gender norms in society is hypergamy, or the tendency for women to try to marry up, and for men to marry down.  And this gender norm is mostly enforced by women, not by men.\n\nTwo other gender norm that are enforced by women is the providership gender norm, and the childcare gender norm. Which also causes women to perform more unpaid work and earn less money than men in the labor market.\n\nA fourth gender norm that is enforced by women more than men is the \"boys don't cry bias\". Which is mainly instilled in young boys by their mothers and by female school teachers.  In fact, fathers and male school teachers actually fight against this gender norm.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053535711000321\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/messages-of-shame-are-organized-around-gender/275322/\n\nhttps://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/09/24/chapter-1-public-views-on-marria\n\nhttps://scholar.harvard.edu/files/akillewald/files/money_work_and_marital_stability.pdf\n\nhttps://www.fatherhood.org/fatherhood/maternal-gatekeeping-why-it-matters-for-children\n\nhttps://news.uoguelph.ca/2019/11/mothers-push-gender-stereotypes-more-than-fathers-study-reveals/\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/gjtj10/most_people_regardless_of_gender_prefer_to_stay/\n\n####Myth 11: \"Toxic masculinity is harming men and their mental health\"\n\nThe concept of toxic masculinity has never been empirically tested, and some research questions the validity of it in the context of psychology and mental health.\n\nEven if you do think it is valid though, it is still commonly used in a way that is sexist and hateful torwards men.\n\nIn recent years it has become associated with female supremacy, feminist hostility towards men, and misandry in general.  And as a result, the vast majority of men find the term to be sexist and offensive.\n\nMen who identify with traditional masculine values have greater self-esteem, better mental health, better relationships with women, and are usually better educated than men who are opposed to masculinity or who accept feminist views about the patriarchy and toxic masculinity.\n\nThe key to better mental health for men might therefore be an embracement of masculinity, not a shunning of it.  Instead of trying to redefine masculinity, we should work to understand it better, and offer men better services based on an honest acknowledgement that men's and women's mental health might require different approaches.\n\nMen are not \"defective women\", and treating men's mental health in that context does not seem to be working very well.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/apa-guidelines-men-boys.html\n\nhttps://zenodo.org/record/3871217#.X-p1ji2l2J_\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_5\n\n####Myth 12: \"Most men's activists just hate women or are opposed to feminism.  They don't really care about men.\"\n\nThis rhetoric is normally used to silence the voices of men (and women) who support men's rights and prevent them from expressing themselves.  Which makes it another example of testimonial injustice or epistemic oppression.\n\nThe fact is that many people do care about men's issues, and that's why they become MRAs.  Feminism does get discussed in the men's movement, but there are a couple reasons for that:\n\n1. Many feminists, \"radical\" or otherwise, have advocated against men and have even pushed for public policy in ways that are harmful to men or discriminates against men. Feminists themselves tend to not fight against this, meaning it's often up to MRAs to address it.\n\n2. Many MRAs are themselves current or ex-feminists who were ostracized for daring to take the feminist rhetoric about *\"also caring about men\"* a little too seriously.\n\nWarren Farrell is a great example of this. He used to be on the board of directors for NOW, the world's largest feminist organization.\n\nAnd then he said that we need to work on child custody equality and reproductive rights for men. Topics that he assumed should fall under the umbrella of feminism since they are issues pertaining to gender equality.  Instead of agreeing with him though, he ended up being excommunicated from the feminist movement. And now he's often regarded as the \"father of the modern men's movement\" for carrying on his advocacy outside of feminism.\n\nThe problem that many MRAs have with feminism is that it usually stops half way when advocating for gender equality.\n\nSo sometimes what MRAs are doing is just taking it the rest of the way towards actual gender equality. Our frustration with feminists comes from the fact that they refuse to see this as valid (or do it themselves to begin with).\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ihmb2p/by_denying_that_the_feminist_establishment_is/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/9v6tqj/a_list_about_feminism_misandry_for_anyone_who/\n\n####Myth 13: \"Men don't receive custody of their children because they're bad fathers and don't bother requesting custody\"\n\nAcademic research simply does not back this up.  [The only study that ever found something like this was discovered to be purposefully fraudulent](http://www.breakingthescience.org/SJC_GBC_analysis_intro.php), although that hasn't stopped people from trying to repeat this. The fact is that men are widely discriminated against on numerous different fronts when it comes to child custody and other areas involving family court law.  \n\nNote also how hateful this rhetoric is.  This is the kind of stuff that you find repeated by feminists, and it simply doesn't treat this topic in a fair and honest manner.  Fathers love their children and many fight tooth and nail just to get a few hours a week to spend with them. The system is broken and it represents a grave social injustice that is deeply unfair to fathers and their children.\n\nhttps://www.sharedparenting.org/2019-shared-parenting-report\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ilzceq/cmv_equal_child_custody_for_mothers_and_fathers/\n\n####Myth 14: \"Most child abusers are men\"\n\nA majority of child abuse is actually committed by women, and especially by mothers.  This is even more true when you include emotional abuse and neglect instead of just physical abuse.\n\nBy some metrics, the biological father is the safest person for a child to be with. This is because when men do abuse children, it often happens while under the custody of the mother.  Who is sometimes complicit in the abuse or even encourages it.\n\nClose to half of child abductors and traffickers are also women, not men.  And many of their victims are boys.  Boys face sexual abuse and are also used for forced labor and organ harvesting. They are less likely to survive or escape, are less likely to be reported on or identified, and they suffer from higher rates of abuse than girls who are trafficked.\n\nAnd yet very little attention is given to this.  Missing boys, and especially missing minority boys, are often ignored by society and the media. To the point that people often assume that most of the victims are girls.  Something which is known as the [missing white woman syndrome](https://archive.is/mRIJL) (although in Canada there is a lot of attention given to missing indigenous women, even though 71% of missing indigenous people are men and boys).\n\nNote that I'm not saying these things to attack women, imply that they shouldn't receive custody, or to downplay the plight of girls.  Which is a lot more than you can say about people who try to paint men as the villains in this picture.  We should however be fair about what the facts are, and give male victimization, including victimization by women, the attention that it deserves.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16165212\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/childmaltreatment-facts-at-a-glance.pdf\n\nhttp://www.breakingthescience.org/SimplifiedDataFromDHHS.php\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0145213416302599\n\nhttps://www.savethechildren.org/us/charity-stories/child-trafficking-myths-vs-facts\n\n*Fair is fair and equal is equal.  Gender equality will never be fixed if we refuse to look at both sides of the coin.  We need to be honest about what the problems are, and stop ignoring them when they involve men, fathers, and boys.*",

I had this enlightening question pop into my head that said\" WhY THE F*** am i doing this?? For whom?\" Now that's a really cut through bullshit question. It changed a lot for me and for the trajectory of my life because i simply didn't have an answer. I really didn't. I realised that most of the things that i did were conditioned and how much of a herd thinker i was.\n\n At that time i didnt know anything about feminism and that it bore witness to issues like this( actually i got to know femimism because i was accused of being one hah).So i just thought that most people were ok with body hair and it should be a choice. \nOh boy, little did i know that not that many had the same understanding and didnt come anywere near the realization that i had. I figured most were asleep in utter delusions.\n\n❌❗❗I am not shittig on people who choose to shave and are ok with other people not doing it or at least are tolerant of it . Its all good. I dont have issues with them. But I have with those who, lets say \"chose\" to shave, and believe that everyone should fall in line with their preconceived notions, and if they dont they are gross❗❗\n\n\nSo at first i didnt really announce to my family that i stopped shaving. But occasionally my mother saw that i had hairy legs,pubic area, armpits and the whole abuse ( psychological) began with jokes and uncomfortable questions. ⚠️ \" Oh, why dont you shave? Its a lot, its too dark\",  \"Forgot your razor?! Honey,dont go out like that\"⚠️\n Then comparisons kicked in even when i firmly said that i am not going back with this. That was my boundary. It has been violated ever since. \n\"⚠️ But none of your classmates look like you\" , \" x,y,z, have it smooth, what they will think about it?!\" ⚠️\nAs if i care mum,as if i do. Then it spiraled into more pushy comments( though i clearly said i wasnt comfortable with those jokes ,they hurt), as she saw that i was rather persistent with my decision. Snakes and stones wont break my bones kind of thing ahhaha or  when the only bully in your life is your OWN mother. It went into ↙️\" Oh trying to be \"like a man\", \" Why dont you cover up\" .↖️ \nThen they brought my brother in. He started viewing female body hair as gross too(( and made typical 🔃\" your hair is much more than mine\"🔄. In all that crap and humiliation people who helped me through this were my friends. They supported me and said that i was very brave( it shoudnt be a courageous or RADICAL act really, but given the situation that we have it seems so). I whoud vent about all the abuse to my friends and they would look at me with the face of \" Why do people still think like that\"? I didnt know either. Insecurity? Fear? Conditioning?  Shame? Who knows... \n\nBut to see adults act like kids is the most disheartening thing to see. To realise you are only valued for your looks and that once you challenge their beliefs they are ready to kick you out, you begin to ask yourself \"do they love me at all\"?. They dont respect anything that i am as a human.  How? \n My literal freedom is restricted,  because of what? Yes, hair. I wasnt allowed to wear shorts or anything that showed body hair and my parents refused to share a table with me. Whilst no one said anything to my dad who has hair 56 times longer or thicker than mine. I was treatened to be kicked out of the house or my school( my mum is a teacher there), if i didnt shave ://///\nNot only that but constant reminders of how ugly , unworthy i am 🚫\" You will be alone then\", \" They will all reject you\" \" People will laugh at you\"🚫\nIt effects my mental health quiet strongly and none of my male friends have to go through this. Which is why it's absolutely sexist.\n\n\nIt hurts. Cuz deep in my heart i love them. They have done a lot for me and they are generally good people. But this gets on my nerves and effects our daily interactions. Yet i am also financially dependant on them which means i have zero power. Zero.\nMoreso it hurts to see loved ones so deluded and when it all gets projected onto you it sucks. It can really effect ones self esteem. I think the role of a parent is to help a kid to love themselves  and help them change if they WANT to , but not to shame them or put them into boxes. They should be a helpful  hand , not that of force or abuse.\n\nAnd  lastly ,for those of you saying sexism doesnt exist and it isnt effecting anybody or we are past that. I hope my story is a great representation why we need feminism or actually COMMON SENSE, which feminism seems to stand for. My story is clearly one of sexism. Did my brother have to go through same shaming? Did he had to hide his armpits ot legs? Or was he called ugly or unworthy cuz of it? Was he threatened in any way\". \n\nWe are equals in this regard. Both of us HAVE hair naturally. Yet we are not treated equally.\n\nSo... \nI  hope we will one day come to the point were having natural fucking hair is normalized and people see you not less of a woman if you have hair. Or having smth that doesnt correspond to the boxes of what a female or male should be like.\nAs Bono( or love of my life❤🕺🏻😅) from U2 said  in his song \" I wanna tear down the walls that hold me inside\"\n\nThe walls are in our heads. If we examine them well enough they will show their illusory nature. But it takes willingness. Some dont have it.\n\n Change starts with you.\nWe are equals and should be treated as such...☮",

I am an elementary school teacher who is trying to raise his students up to be the best they can be. I teach at a low income school, filled with families of all backgrounds and situations. As a man, I want to be an example of a strong, supportive man where many of my student don’t have such an example. I try and get all students excited to learn. I try and show examples of all people being successful in various careers.\n\nBut I have more to do. Please help me. Can you give me some more ideas that I can incorporate into making my class super supportive and epithetic? Looking back what do you wish people did or said that would have helped you grow?",
