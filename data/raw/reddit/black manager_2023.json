    "text": "Just got my first 6 figure job offer! Just wanted to share with someone Hi everyone! I don't have too many people I can talk about this with, so I just wanted to share the news with someone. I work in software, and my current pay is $75k per year. The short version of my past few years is that I dropped out of college and have been making $45k/ year for a while pre-COVID. From there, 2020 hit me really hard. I was unemployed for about 6 months. I was looking for $18/hour jobs, then I got an opportunity in software sales. I started at a base salary of $50k per year. I got promoted once and then moved over to operations within my company, and my salary went up to $75k (where it is now).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving been at my current company for 3 years, I've known that I was underpaid compared to the market for a while, so I started looking a few months ago. I applied to this job that's a manager-level position, which is one level above my current role. I had my final round interview at this company last week and it went pretty well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe hiring manager set some time with me yesterday afternoon. When we hopped on the call, we talked for a few minutes before she offered me the job! $120k per year! In the moment, I didn't react much outwardly or inwardly beyond being pleasant and expressing thankfulness and excitement about the offer. I was trying to keep my hand close to my vest I suppose. I ended up thanking her and agreeing to follow up on Monday after I had the weekend to think about it (as I was in the process of a few other interviews as well). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the hour after we hopped off Zoom, I didn't feel much. Then the offer letter hit my inbox. Seeing $120,000 in black and white is when it hit me. $10,000/month. I broke down and started crying. That's more money than I've ever made before by a long shot. I wanted to call my dad and tell him because I know that he'd be proud. He died in 2020, so I got hit with a wave of emotions from excitement to relief, to grief hitting me super hard. I've had a lot of money stress over the past few years, and this feels like a game changer. I'm hoping that this will accelerate my ability to build up savings and I want to be smart with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that's my ramble. Thanks for listening. Today I'm excited and am looking forward to accepting on Monday. I still wish I could call my dad up and tell him though; I know he'd be happy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: wow, I appreciate all the love! The positivity is really great to see.",

    "text": "I quit and was placed on the do not rehire list. I just quit a job at a retail pharmacy because of how toxic my manager was. It was so disorganized. The drink coolers are full of mold and I also had been out for about a month because of surgery and recovery. My manager harassed me every week asking when I was returning. She said she “wasn’t” aware I submitted FMLA (Family medical leave act) but when I resubmitted it she got an email and questioned me about it? She’s narcissistic and loves to throw things in your face. I let her know I may be calling off work more often due to my surgery and the unpredictability of when I’m not feeling well. Last week I got so sick to the point I was throwing up and she had the nerve to tell me not to call off because she has plans. After I quit she kept saying I ruined her plans and not once during my recovery did she even check on me to see if I was ok. I stayed longer than I should have. I filed a complaint against her and I’m encouraging my coworker to do the same since she’s made racist remarks towards him (he’s black, shes white)",

    "text": "I left a job after 6 months once I found out I was the diversity hire. How do I explain the brief stay in an interview? I was hired as an assistant manager at a very popular retail store back in 2022. I eventually found out I was just their diversity hire as it slipped they needed to hit numbers for more POC on the sales floor. I also realized no one took me seriously, was always talked over, disregarded and talked down to, and my manager responsibilities were given to other managers while I was used as a fill in 80% of the time.\n\nThings turned sour as soon as I hit my 6 month mark and suddenly I had numerous complaints about me. Was told to go home and I was on a paid hold until I heard something from HR. Well, I was ghosted for a month by HR and my managers until I called corporate.\n\nI obviously did not want to go back to work for the company after all this. I gave HR my two week notice and got the rest of my pay check. I spoke to a family member about the situation, who had worked in HR for 6+ years, she said it very much sounded like we all were diversity hired and obviously weren't meant to stay long.\n\nShe gave me the advice to tell interviewers that it was a temp/seasonal position for the summer. Also to say I couldn't list references as I worked with minors or very young adults. However, if they really did push to low key have a friend (who knew retail) pretend and vouch for me, if I really needed it. \n\nIs this sound advice or should I be honest about being a fill in for a job?\n\nEdit1: Thank you all for the comments! I do appreciate it! To clear some things up, I did take initiative in the role. I did ask the other managers and SM for help on how the store was normally ran but I kept getting different answers. Everyone had their way of doing things and it wasn't consistent. SM did not like that I tried to impliment different things to learn. She had a very OCD way of doing things but it cut into my time of running the sales floor. She'd want me to write down our KPIs in a binder with pen and paper instead of using our computer system for accuracy. The first 2 months I did ask how my performance was doing and was told I was doing fine and that I was making sales. After that, my performance was never broached or I was told I was doing good and not to worry. So I didn't think much of it. I never was properly trained and a lot of the other managers got away with things because they had known the manager since they worked in the store as teens years ago. Also, this was not a salaried position but hourly. I've been an ASM in the past and had done fine with no issues. What I felt confused about was that I would direct my sales team and then hear my manager on our ear piece saying to disregard my guidance and do it her way when I was the MOD for the hour. I'd talked to her about it but she wouldn't take accountibility for the back and forth. She had a habit of expecting people to read in between the lines when I'd ask her to just be direct. She also would hire POC and disregard their unavailable days and schedule them regardless. This led to some of the teens having no shows due to them trusting her when she'd promise their days off.\n\nAn example of how I lost some respect with my sales team: A WOC had asked me if she had enough time to put in a 4 day leave as she was going to some college open house with her family. I told her yes, that she had two weeks in advance and it should be fine and that I'd text and leave a note for the SM to make sure she saw the time off sheet. SM saw it, I mentioned it, told me she took care of it and still scheduled that employee and gave her a warning for missing her shifts. I did not know that until the week of and told SM she had made a mistake. She said \"Oops. Oh well. Guess I'll have to talk to her for missing then.\" Employee obviously was upset as I told her I'd be diligent in letting SM know. I was. Unfortunately the incident spread through the store and I was avoided for the most part.\n\nEdit 2: I know future employers are only supposed to get clarification on when I worked, job title and to make sure I was actually at the job. But I have heard a lot of previous and current managers tell people that they wouldn't hire XYZ again and leave it at that.\n\nEdit 3: I'm seeing some comments about my qualifications about being in the ASM role. This was not my first job or even a second. I'd worked 3 retail jobs consistently between 2013 to end of 2015. Each role I went up from being sales floor, customer service agent to even ASM at another retailer before the store closed. During 2015-2019 I was married to a military personal and we moved frequently along with living overseas. In 2020 I worked during covid and had successfully kept a year long job until I needed to find a higher paying job. Between then I had a 6 month contract job then the 6 month stint as the ASM at the retail store in question.\n\n\nSome of these comments are borderline racist in themselves. Btw, I'm not black. I'm Asian, a woman, and not some newbie in my early 20s. \n\n\nTo clarify, I work in the Midwest, USA.",

    "text": "Black in a predominantly Hispanic workplace. Disclaimer: I am not shaming the entire group of people.\n\nI live in Miami, FL. I was born in Jamaica and came to America when I was five years old. Went to school here all my childhood life. I’ve been working in the hospital and some insurance carrier over the last 10+ years. I’m very friendly and soft spoken. I don’t know how to stand up for myself because I do not like confrontations, but I’m getting to annoyed by it at this point. The first job I work at was at Jackson hospital, you can really sense how people treat their own and the way they talk to you and how it comes off as discriminatory. Miami is full of Cubans and Venezuelans, overall majority of them are great people, but a lot of the older populations of them are rude and extremely prejudice. I understand Spanish but I do not speak it well. I never told anyone at my job that I understood Spanish, and I also understand French. Throughout my years of working alongside with them I’ve been called many names that were derogatory and disgusting. I’ve been called a monkey, an ESL persons, stupid, etc. A whole bunch of nonsense. Now more recently it’s been an uptick with it now. They scream and shout at me when things don’t go their way. Management doesn’t treat me the same like the other Spanish speaking employees. They get the sweet talk, I get talked down with aggression, they write me up for things that I personally don’t see any wrong doing. I go home cry about it then come the next day. My mom is a Christian lady and all she tells me to do is pray. I make decent pay, that’s why I am still there. Any time they bring cafecito (the cuban coffee) they ask every Hispanic person if they want some, then when they come to me they don’t even ask they just passes me then an hour later will come up to me to tell me that Cuban coffee is in the pantry. I don’t know if im overthinking it but it’s not a friendly environment. I even heard the manager said in Spanish one time that if it was up to her she’ll fire all the black people because it’s not 1960s anymore and we need to find our own environment the whole office burst out laughing then I saw some of the people looking at me but not saying anything. I want to leave the job but I’m afraid the next employer is going to call them and my current job will do everything in their will to not get my hired. I requested so many times to be transferred and my manager declined it. She even converse about why she declined me in Spanish to my other coworkers. What can I do?",

    "text": "Fired for the first time in my life As the title says, I was recently fired from my Job (November 30th).  It was for a stupid reason, but it is essentially preventing me from getting unemployment.  It's currently in adjudication.  I'm basically at the swan song part of my working life, I'm am 59 1/2 years old.  Since I can no longer do the kind of work that I spent the majority of my life doing, I am relegated to no experience labor type jobs.\n\nBeing the age that I am with relatively no lengthy work experience in these no experience labor type jobs has made finding work a real challenge.  Now that I have been fired, I'm stuck trying to explain why I was terminated.  I'm finding my age, the fact that I don't have related work experience, and being recently fired a major hurdle to overcome.  It also doesn't help that I am a woman, people just see me as some old lady, not a potential applicant when I show up for an interview.\n\nI've worked my entire life, never once been fired, just have a skillset that I can no longer work in, and quite frankly, haven't done for the past 10 years anyways.  Did a job at a highly specialized manufacturing place that doesn't translate out of that sort of work.  It was at a high density micro flex manufacturing company, there are only but a handful in the US that do that sort of work.  My last place of employment was at a Amazon warehouse, so now you understand the stupid reason for termination.\n\nI'd like to continue working in some form of manufacturing or warehousing work but lack the work history to apply for anything but no experience.  If I do get an interview, they are taken aback by my age and immediately see me as their grandmother or something.  I also just don't know how to talk about being fired.  In my opinion it wasn't something worthy of a termination, but it's their company, they can fire at-will employees for just about anything.\n\nAny advice on how to get a entry level job in a field that is clearly dominated by men when all you really have is the ability to learn, work hard, and be 100% dependable?  Trying to break that glass ceiling.  Any older female workers out there been in the same boat?  I like working in a labor intensive fast-paced work environment, it makes the day go by faster.  Amazon gave me that.  I've applied to a truck manufacturing job that claims they will train you and no experience required, but fear as soon as they see me, they will assume I am not going to be up for the job.  I can't really blame them, very few women seek out this sort of work at my age.\n\nEDIT:  \n\nI'm so glad I made this post, you all have been very helpful and have picked up my spirits.  The reason I am looking for a labor type role is because I can't sit for long periods of time without developing swelling in the legs, feet, and ankles.  I have lymphedema.  I manage it best by being on the move all day, desk jobs are not a fit for me with this condition, even with compression stockings.  Never had a flair up while working at Amazon.  Every desk job I have ever had has always caused a flair up over time.\n\nMy termination from Amazon was a category 1 safety infraction.  I appealed the termination, but Amazon is not known for overturning such dismissals.  It was a minor incident, no one was injured, no damage to equipment, just let go of a stow cart as I was moving it out of one of my aisles.  No risk to anyone as no one was in the area at the time.  Amazon is pretty black and white about their safety infractions, so they are all treated like someone could have been injured et al.  No gray area.  They don't make it a point to tell their employees what they consider termination offenses, they just call them category 1 offenses.  You basically find out, after the fact.  It's this termination that is causing hiccups with my unemployment claim and my future ability to work at a place that highly values safety in the workplace.  They may not consider it a minor incident any more than Amazon.\n\nA little history of the types of jobs I have done:\n\nWorked at a bicycle manufacturing company where I worked on a moving line attaching components and routing brake cables, among other things.\n\nWorked at a high-density micro flex printed circuit board manufacturing company.  Worked in their imaging department laminating substrate and silk screening solder mask, printed customer designs via laser direct imaging and processed them through a developer bath.  Went on to do the CAM department where I prepared customer files for manufacturing and created laser and CNC files for manufacturing.  Highly specialized work, really only a handful of companies in the entire US that do that sort of work.\n\nWorked in the aerospace industry as a computer-based training multimedia developer.  Worked with engineering models and data to create 3D animations and graphics for their courseware. Worked on both military and commercial training and held a top secret clearance while in that role.\n\nWorked at an Amazon delivery station processing packages for customer delivery.  Worked on both their automated and manual belts.  Scanned and moved packages weighing up to 50 lbs into totes or onto OV racks for pick and stage.  During pick and stage, picked packages and totes from these locations based on delivery route and staged them on carts for the delivery drivers.  These were the primary work paths, also worked in haz mat, problem solve, jackpot, induct, and non-con.\n\nMy resume only reflects the flex printed circuit board company and Amazon because it is the most relevant and most recent.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "text": "Am I stupid to still be pissed about the job I was fired from in July? To make an extremely long story short, I was fired in July for recording a video of me doing something at work that wasn't work related. I played one of our display pianos. I got fired for that. I'm still pissed off about it. Full story below. TLDR at the end.\n\nFor context, I'd been working at this job for 4, almost 5 years. I was great at it. I loved my job. I centered a lot of my life around this job because it was in my career path (music education). My new manager, after my old manager left, was a good friend of mine. We got along great. We played games when it wasn't busy, like Minecraft and her Nintendo Switch, we joked and when we had everything completed we chilled.\n\nThat is, until she started to become a corporate suck up and began metaphorically sucking our district manager's dick and randomly became super strict out of nowhere, like not using our phones during work. Even though she frequently still played games and stuff. Then, one day, she fired me. There's a lot of lead up in between, but that's how it ended. \n\nI'm not pissed because I got fired. I wasn't planning on staying at that job forever and I have a MUCH better paying job now, with a lot more freedom, and I don't have to work with customers. \n\nI'm pissed because the shit she fired me for (\"doing non work related things in the clock\") IS THE SAME SHIT SHE WAS DOING. She's a huge fucking hypocrite for talking to me like she literally didn't bring her Nintendo Switch to work to play the Legend of Zelda. All I did was record a 15 second video of me playing one of our display pianos. Which I used to do on my \"break\" all the time (spoiler alert, I frequently ran the store by myself, so yeah, I didn't get a break). She was friends with me on Snapchat and never had a problem with it, until I guess during one of her BJ sessions with our DM he must have brought it up somehow???? Idk it was totally out of the blue.\n\nApologies for the long rant, I've been bottling up my anger and frustration for months now. Why did I get fired, and not her???? She also fired my coworker who provided a PDF of the employee handbook to me after I was fired, because my family wanted to take it to court. (It never happened.)\n\nTo top it all off, the white employee (yes I'm bringing up race, both me and that coworker who was fired are black) who stayed 2 hours after we closed to fuck around on guitars WHILE ON THE CLOCK was given a temp position instead so he could \"have time to find another job.\" But we were fired randomly. No write ups. The only two black employees in the district. \n\nWhere I live, you don't need a write up or anything to get fired, but it still sucks.\n\nTLDR: I'm pissed because I got fired for the same exact shit my manager was doing.",

    "text": "Fixing Work Gaps, Firings, and Apparent Unstable Employment Histories EDIT: Please DM me if you'd like me to help you figure out how to mold your resume to look more like this. This is not a sales pitch. Just free advice because I want more people to break the system and get out of the hole corporate America has put you in.\n\nMany posts lately about work gaps being used against applicants. We've all heard about how job-hopping is still viewed negatively by employers. Firings beyond our control leave black marks on our work histories. I know, because I have hard evidence of it, that being unemployed has been used against me in two cases. You can choose to continue to suffer under the fake rules of a system or you can choose to adapt.\n\nHere's a short guide on how *I* fixed these issues for myself.\n\n* Register a consultancy as a single-member LLC with your state (~$150 depending on your state). Give it some name. Once registered, place that \"employer\" in your gap. If currently unemployed, say you've been consulting since your last job. Or say you've been consulting in parallel with other work.\n\n* If you were fired or left your last job under unfavorable circumstances, say you left on your own accord to pursue building your own consultancy. Similarly, you can say your last job, if you were fired from it, was actually a C2C client and your contract with them ended. Again, no way to verify this except by contacting the employer, which 1) they won't do because (see below) you're under NDA and if they do 2) no employer is going to disclose vendors to some random recruiter or hiring manager and you are a vendor :)\n\n* References: friends and family. The end. Use a friend that maybe one time you talked with about starting a business or building an app. That's it. If you're completely uncomfortable with this, see the step below about gig work and earn a verifiable reference that way.\n\n* If you're worried about legitimacy, your own business does not show up in a typical corporate background check because it's an LLC with an EIN not tied to an SSN, not an individual, so there is no way to verify any of the dates. Similarly, if you choose to say a past employer was a client, there is no distinction made in a background check and it would be very odd for an employer to ask about the work arrangement (W2 vs 1099, which are tax filing questions that I have never encountered using this method).\n\n* If they ask for names of clients, say you're under NDA and can't disclose. I have never once received pushback on this. They will also stop asking about your current salary (they seem to respect that privacy more if you're an independent business owner than if you're a W2 wage slave).\n\n* I went balls to the wall on this and built a full website with \"client testimonials\", created a logo, a LinkedIn page for the business, went on Upwork and did gigs under that business name, all to add legitimacy to it if it was ever scrutinized. Made it seem much bigger than it actually is.\n\n* During interviews when asked why I'm getting out of the consulting business, my go-to response is, \"Well, consulting is fun. You get to be your own boss, choose who you work for and when you work for them. But it's also inherently unstable. Especially in 2023 with the tech market's instability, I'm looking for a safe place to land and I don't mind at all if that's a more stable W2 arrangement.\"\n\nEach of these steps presents one step a recruiter or hiring manager isn't willing to take to challenge you, even if they're suspect of it. Sure, some are going to immediately smell something and decline you. They do it for much more specious reasons anyway (the ease of pronouncing your name, for example). That's just a fact of life in the job search game. But doing these things could potentially get you consideration where you otherwise would not receive it. That's the goal: overcome concerns up front so you can get through the process and start working again.\n\nEDIT: Recruiter scare tactics in the comments. Not surprising at all. They don't like things that even the odds against them but are totally ok doing the same in reverse to candidates. These people have no moral compass, which is a prerequisite for becoming a recruiter. There is no way to verify anything I am recommending. There is no database, no clearinghouse, no nothing that can be used to verify this. The Work Number is the closest thing we have to it and you can freeze that thing and be done with it. \n\nWhat's interesting is do you think these recruiters could detect when someone did this to them? How would they know? What about someone who worked for a family business and was given a prestigious title when they didn't actually do the work? I know people who haven't graduated school who put that they graduated and have not ever been found out. They are now senior managers in well-known companies. \n\nThere's literally no way, no database, no nothing that can detect this. Recruiters saying they can detect lies is bs. Do not be scared.\n\nI have been doing this since before COVID and have not had any issues.",

    "text": "I am an experienced resume writer and editor, and wanted to share some pointers on how to best format your resume [PART 2] Hey r/jobs, it's me again, coming at you with all of the resume advice you could ever need, and more! I posted all of my resume tips and tricks a couple of months back, which led me to receiving an amazingly overwhelming amount of comments (THANK YOU!) and I wanted to clear up some things, and include some things I missed in my last post. I've put all of this advice in order so it's easy to find the info you need when you need it.\n\nTo introduce myself, my name is Holly, and I am an experienced resume writer and editor located in North America. Essentially, I love helping people make their resume the best it can be, and I often help out in the r/jobs discord, and a tech workers slack channel, giving free advice as often as I am able to.\n\nResume writing and editing has been a part time hobby/job for me since 2017. I work full time as a senior account manager in tech, plus I have a bunch of hobbies outside of work, so I give my time where I can, which is unfortunately not as much as it used to be. I guess that's why I've written these posts, because I can no longer help as many people as I used to, and hopefully this way it can assist hundreds or even thousands of people!\n\n***DISCLAIMER: Many of these tips are North America specific,*** ***and some/many don't apply to creative fields like designers/marketing resumes.*** *Also some of these are for people working in the corporate world and don't apply to food service or retail jobs.* ***Of course, some of these won't apply to you specifically, so use your common sense to take what is useful to you.***\n\n~\n\n# CONTACT INFORMATION AND TOP OF PAGE\n\n* **Contact details** \\- at the top when of your resume under or next to your name, you need to include the following things: your location (if you're willing to relocate to the area the job is in, put the jobs city in and not your current location) email address, and your LinkedIn profile. Phone number isn't essential, so include it or don't, it's fine. Other optional things to include - if you have a portfolio or GitHub, definitely include them. Don't paste them as a messy link, instead write \"GitHub\" and turn it into a hyperlink.\n* **Location:** Are you located in San Francisco, California, applying to jobs in your city, and/or remote? Write \"San Francisco, CA\".\n* **Location:** Are you in San Fran, but open to relocation, AT THEIR EXPENSE? Write \"San Francisco, CA (open to relocation)\".\n* **Location:** Are you in San Francisco currently, but you're willing to move **before** starting a new job to New York AT YOUR OWN EXPENSE, where your dream job is located? Or you've already planned to move to New York and you're only applying to roles there? Put your location as \"New York, NY\". Why? Because you're moving there on your own cost prior to starting work, at your own expense.  If it comes up in the interview, tell them the truth. \"This is my dream job and I'm planning to move prior to starting if I'm successful\", or \"I'm moving to New York on X-date - which is prior to the start date of this job - and everything is already organized, which is why I have my location listed as New York rather than San Francisco.\"\n   * If you want them to pay for your relocation fees, then use the (open to relocation) that I wrote above.\n* **DO NOT INCLUDE YOUR FULL ADDRESS IF YOU'RE IN NORTH AMERICA** \\- only include your City and State/Province, and use one of the above depending on your circumstances.\n* **Contact details (what not to include)** \\- don't include the word PHONE before your phone number, or EMAIL before your email address. They are not necessary. People know what a phone and email look like. You're just taking up space for no reason. Also don't include your social media accounts except for LinkedIn (unless they are professional accounts for marketing/design/media positions of course, etc.).\n* **LinkedIn link and info:** Make sure your LinkedIn profile link is customized. You can get a custom LinkedIn link from your LinkedIn profile on the right hand side at the top right, click on \"Edit public profile and URL\". Make sure your custom LI link includes your name and not just a bunch of random numbers. Be creative. Are you a John Smith and you're located in Texas? Maybe your custom link could be smith.john.tx or johnsmith.tx, or include your middle initial. Play around with it until you get the perfect LI custom link. When including your LinkedIn link on your profile, instead of including the whole URL, only include the last bit (for example, **in/johnsmith**) - and lastly, make sure you include the hyperlink on your resume so that people can click it while viewing your resume.\n* Do the same as above with GitHub or any other professional links you're including on your resume. Make it a hyperlink so you're not including some messy link that's killing the \"feng shui\" of your resume.\n* **DO NOT INCLUDE A PHOTO OF YOURSELF IF YOU'RE APPLYING TO JOBS IN NORTH AMERICA.** Companies have to prove that their hiring processes isn't based on race, gender, age, appearance, etc. Including a picture in NA can actually get your resume thrown out entirely. I know LinkedIn profiles include your profile picture, which is weird that we're just okay with this, but not with pictures on resumes, but here we are. Hey, I don't make up the rules, I merely abide by them and am here to ensure your resume is, *\\*chefs kiss\\**, perfectly formatted.\n* **Summary/Objective - to add or not to add?** I only recommend adding one if you're making a career move/change, and applying for jobs that aren't in your career ladder. The other alternative is if you've been out of your industry for a while, either studying or working in a completely different field, or if you took a break and need to explain the gap in work. I believe a summary should be no longer than 5 lines of the page maximum, which is typically around 3-4 sentences. You don't need a summary if you're looking for jobs on your current career ladder and don't have any gaps on your resume.\n\n# HOW TO ORGANIZE YOUR RESUME (IN ORDER)\n\n* If you HAVE had relevant experience since your education, then put your professional experience first. DO NOT INCLUDE YOUR HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION (unless you're still in high school, or are looking for your first or second job out of highschool, or if you don't have university to add to it and you have less than 2 years of work experience). So it would go like:\n   * (1.) Name and contact info, LinkedIn, GitHub etc. 2. Summary/objective (if adding it) 3. Experience 4. Education & Certifications 5. Projects (if you have any you want to add, and the space to add them, or simply link to your GitHub or LinkedIn and list them there) 6. Skills 7. Volunteering - if it's going to assist with your current career, or if you have the space for it 8. Languages spoken (only add this if you speak more than one language fluently) 9. Interests (if you have the space and want to add them)\n* If you HAVEN'T had relevant experience and your education was in the past 1-3 years and it's relevant to your job, then:\n   * (1.) Name and contact info, LinkedIn, GitHub etc. 2. Summary/objective (if adding it - I do recommend it here to explain the direction you're heading) 3. Education & Certifications 4. Projects (if you have any) 5. Skills 6. Volunteering (if you have any) 7. Languages spoken (only add this if you speak more than one language fluently) 8. Interests\n* Basically, just put the best most recent and relevant info at the top that relates to the jobs you're applying to, and mark it in order from there.\n\n# ONE PAGE OR TWO?\n\nAh I love this question, people get so heated about it haha! There's a lot of variables and a lot of opinions on this, so let's get into it...\n\n* FIRST THINGS FIRST - If you're going to go to 2 pages, for the love of the flying spaghetti monster, DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT have it as less than 1.5 pages. If you're commiting to 2 pages, USE THE SECOND PAGE. Beef up some bullet points, make some of the text or the lines larger, whatever you need to do if you're absolutely convinced it will not fit on one page. Otherwise, REDUCE that bad boy to 1 page. Nothing quite grinds my gears as much as seeing an 8th of the second page being used. IT LOOKS AWFUL, REALLY REALLY AWFUL. Thanks for letting me get that off my chest.\n* Unless you're in senior management, your resume (for North American applicants anyway) should be one page ideally, two pages max if you have over 10 years of RELEVANT experience, but in saying that...\n* Do you have LESS than 10 years of university and work experience combined, and you're NOT in a high up VP/Director position? You are likely best to go with one page.\n* No education after highschool, but you've got 10 years or less of really amazing experience, but not in a higher up position? You are likely best to go with one page.\n* Do you have LESS than 10 years of university and work experience combined but you also have a few AMAZING projects you worked on separately, and you've done relevant volunteer work, and your resume is actually kind of incredible? Then hell yeah, go for 2 pages! Brag all you want and show them why they need to hire you!\n* I could go on. Just one page or two, either way, ensure you use the full page if you've got it, I hate seeing only 1.5 pages or less. Either bring it closer to 2, or bring it down to 1.\n* **\"What about 3 pages, or 4, or 5? I have so many jobs and I'm awesome and want to show them!\" In North America, NO, GET OUT OF HERE, ABSOLUTELY NOT!** They won't see it as \"Wow this person is amazing\", they will see it as \"Oh wow this person doesn't know how to write a resume, and this is way too long for me to bother to read\" and they'll delete it. In other parts of the world? Sure. I know some countries like the UK for instance that want a full CV (they are different from resumes, as they list every single job, achievement, certification, volunteer experience, and more) that are often 3+ pages long. Well, my advice isn't for UK resumes, because that's not my specialty. I'm just saying that 2 is the max for North America.\n* Need to find extra space on your resume to reduce it down to 1 or 2 pages? **Use narrow margins.**\n* **SO ONE PAGE OR TWO?** Honestly, either is fine if you're using the space efficiently, and aren't writing giant bullet points and paragraphs. ***If you're unsure, go for one page.***\n\n# GENERAL FORMATTING\n\n* **Make sure EVERYTHING is uniform**. If most of your dates are 3 letters only, like Jun 2016 - Oct 2020, then they ALL need to be the same. Yes, even the months of June and July with just one more letter. It looks much neater. Ensure you double check the spacing is correct too, for example, the most common error I see on resumes is some dates having a space and then a hyphen, and then no space before the next date (example Jan 2019 -Jun 2020 and then Jul 2020-Feb 2022, then Apr 2022 - Present) - this is a very small issue, but it shows you do not have attention to detail. Whichever format you choose for one, ensure they ALL follow the same format.\n* Double check if something is bolded, or underlined (like a title or date or company name), ensure that all the others are in the same format.\n* Is the font the same for each section? It's fine if you're using different fonts on your resume, but ensure that each section is the same. For example, if one job with all the bullet points are Times New Roman, then all jobs needs to be in Times New Roman. If one section header is Garamond, and the next section header is Times New Roman, it shows you don't have the attention to detail.\n* **Remember, your resume needs to be PERFECT. You seriously need to go through each line by line with a fine tooth comb.** Imagine not securing an interview with your dream job because of a few silly spelling mistakes or poor formatting. \"Well I didn't want that job anyway\"... yeah you did. It can be a hard pill to swallow and it's easy to make light of it, but you never know who is the one deciding on the yes or no pile and where yours will land.\n* **Ensure all line breaks are the same size**. If one blank line in between 2 paragraphs is size 7, and then the next blank line between paragraphs is size 11, it's a very noticeable detail to those looking at your resume.\n* **For your paragraphs and bullet points, use the \"justify\" align**. It removes a bit of the white space and brings your text fully to the right of the page. It's much neater and removes the jagged look of left align. The exception to this (as there usually are) is if none of your bullet points are longer than one line. I like justify align on a summary/objective if you're adding one, and on bullet points or any paragraphs that are 2 lines or longer. Play around with it and see what works best for your resume.\n* **DON'T WASTE AN ENTIRE LINE ON A HANDFUL OF WORDS!** I often see people when writing their bullet points taking up less than half a line, or only a couple of words on the 2nd or 3rd line. Not only does this create a lot of white space, but it's also selling yourself short. You have one, maybe two pages to sell the sh!t out of yourself. Make every single line of your page count. Make sure every single line of your bullet points is at least halfway across the page or more. Either beef up that bullet point, or condense it.\n* **5 bullet points max per job** (of course there are exceptions, but this is as a general rule). The older the job, the less bullet points. A job from 10 years ago will only require 1-3 bullet points (and only if it's relevant to your current career. Really think hard about whether to include it on your resume or not. Remember, all your jobs are on LinkedIn, not everything needs to go on your resume... again, North American advice).\n* **Use a different verb at the start of each bullet point.** I roll my eyes when I see the same word repeated multiple times as the first word in bullet points. Instead of just using the word managed, use words like Coordinated / Directed / Orchestrated / Oversaw / Spearheaded. There's a great article written by the Muse, you can find it here: [https://www.themuse.com/advice/185-powerful-verbs-that-will-make-your-resume-awesome](https://www.themuse.com/advice/185-powerful-verbs-that-will-make-your-resume-awesome). If you work in a field with specific wording, like Nursing for example, then google \"Nursing resume verbs\" or something like that. Put the work in to your research for your resume wording and you'll reap the rewards.\n* **DO NOT USE COLUMNS** (unless you're in a creative field like a designer, or your resume is being handed to someone in person) - Columns do not play nicely with ATS (AI resume reading software) and as the majority of companies now rely on ATS to quickly read resumes, you're shooting yourself in the foot by using columns or any other weird formatting.\n* Each bullet point should not be paragraphs long. Each bullet point should be 1-2 lines long only on the page, 3 maximum.\n* Each job should take up no more than 1/4 of the page, unless you've only had one or two jobs, or are more senior. Or in another unit of measurement, no more than 11 or 12 lines of the page. The more recent the role, and the more impressive the tasks, the more bullet points there should be, but don't just include the job description which leads me onto my next point...\n* Reiterating that each job should only include the achievements from that job, and only the most impressive things you achieved should be listed. Include KPIs, processes you implemented, articles you wrote, dollar amounts of your biggest sales or averages, include numbers of accounts you managed, or how many calls you took each day, if you went over your OTE what was the percentage, etc. It shouldn't read as a job description, you need to sell yourself and show them what you're capable of! (disclaimer - unless your jobs are more entry level or food service etc, then job descriptions are likely the norm).\n* Don't include irrelevant jobs/projects. If you worked at Starbucks for 6 months 5 years back, and you've had relevant experience in your field after that, then remove the Starbucks (or whatever other unrelated jobs you have) from your resume. Your resume should be tailored to the jobs you're applying for! To give you some more reference, I have been working since 2003, and my resume only has jobs from 2014 onwards.\n* **Try to have your dates on the right hand side of the page, and your position and company on the left (list the position first, then the company next to it or below it).** It's the standard, and makes the person reading your resume find the info much more quickly. Trying to make your resume too unique (again, unless you have a creative job then ignore this) will only hurt your chances of it being taken seriously. Of course you want to make it look nice, but try to follow the standard format where possible so it's easy to read.\n\n# SKILLS & INTERESTS\n\n* **Put your technical/software/program skills in one line**, separated by commas or | lines | like | these. Putting a single skill on each line is a waste of space, and will create too much white space. Your resume should be concise, to the point and get everything across in as little space as possible.\n* **Don't use the \"slider\" scales for your proficiency in various skills.** Why? Well, firstly, if the hiring manager wants to know your level in each, they will ask. And secondly, the dots or slider scales aren't measurable and take up extra wasted space that again is not going work well with ATS. Instead, as I mentioned above, list your skills and programs/software etc. in a line separated by commas | or | these | lines. Don't include software that you used 10 years ago and never progressed past a beginner level, but list pretty much everything else within reason. Most things you'll pick back up quickly even if it was 5 years ago, provided you were semi-decent with your knowledge of it.\n* What about interpersonal skills? Should you add them? I highly recommend adding them into your bullet points, rather than listing them separately. In saying that, though, there's going to be some industries, or some skills, that require them listed separately. If you're listing them separately, first ensure that you actually need them on the resume, and which ones are necessary and which ones can be removed if any. If you're still adament you want to list them separately, then put them in the same format as your technical/software skills as I listed above, either separating each with the | lines | like | these, or with commas, one on line. And that line needs to go below the hard/tech/software skills, not before, and ideally not together.\n* **Languages:** In North America, only list a languages section if you speak more than one language. Always list English first as this is a job requirement every time, and then other languages after that. If you're fluent in English, a native in Spanish, fluent in French, and have intermediate German, I would list it as such:\n   * \"Languages: Fluent in English, Spanish and French, intermediate in German.\"\n* **Interests - should you add them or not?** It's a highly debated topic and everyone will have a different view on this. I personally believe that you should include them. For example, I ride motorcycles and love stand up comedy shows, am coffee obsessed and love my local lacrosse team. Almost every single interview I land, my interests are brought up, with the interviewer connecting with one or more of my interests, or asking me more about them. It's a great conversation starter, and it makes you more than just an applicant, they will remember you as the person who they discussed their favourite sports team with, or the person who recommended them an amazing cafe that they've now added to their list. INTERESTS WILL MAKE YOU STAND OUT, I guarantee it. **Obviously, it can be negative depending on what you write, so be REALLY selective of what you include in your interests** (for example, don't include things like Anime or Manga, or the shooting range, or reading Holocaust novels, or your weapons collection, or anything political or religious, or anything you don't want to discuss during an interview - KEEP IT LIGHTHEARTED). I would make your interests 1 or 2 lines maximum on your resume, and don't go into detail (just list them out - for example, my interests on my resume are listed as \"Interests: Motorcycles, Warriors lacrosse, console and PC games, comedy shows, arcades, & searching for the perfect espresso.\") So basically, include them if you want, but if you do include them, make sure they aren't negative or controversial topics if it's brought up in an interview.\n\n# AVOID COMMON MISTAKES\n\n* \"References available upon request\" or adding references to your resume, is a BIG no no for North American resumes. Why? Because 1. it's assumed that you have references available on request, so including that is unnecessary, and 2. You don't want the company contacting your references if you've listed them, PRIOR to letting your bosses know, which is usually after you've received an offer, and 3. You don't want your references, whom have so kindly agreed to be one for you, getting inundated with calls or emails from the companies you're applying to, prior to the offer stage. Imagine applying to 50 companies, and all 50 call your references. Ouch. They won't be your reference for much longer.\n* Is your job across two pages? Nope, that's not going to work! I hate when I see a jobs bullet points going onto the next page. In my opinion, it's messy and just says \"poor formatting\".\n* **DO NOT MAKE YOUR RESUME TOO FLASHY! STOP WITH THE COLOURED TEXT!!** (this applies to non-design resumes only) Black text ONLY, with the exception of your name, contact information and section headers. You can put those in a colour other than black for a tiny bit of a \"pop\", but nothing overly in your face like red or bright pink. I personally use a dark blue, or dark green, or dark purple for the contact info and headers - DO NOT USE LIGHT COLOURS if you're going to use any at all. But objective/experience/skills/education etc, all the actual sections (not section headers) must be black text ONLY.\n* You absolutely should not have any images, and there should NOT be any background colour or background images whatsoever.\n* Do not use tables on your resume. That won't pass ATS and it looks pretty bad honestly.\n* Don't include a paragraph at the end along the lines of \"thanks for your time, please call me on 555-123-4567 if you have any questions or would like to set up an interview\". This isn't a cover letter. And even if it was, don't include your phone numebr or email in the cover letter body, that should be included with your contact details at the top of your cover letter, which should match the same format of your resume.\n* If you're going onto a second page, include the exact same name and contact information format as you have on your first (and other pages if outside of the US where more than 2 pages is common).\n\n# FINAL STEPS - SENDING YOUR RESUME\n\n* **NAMING YOUR RESUME:** And I'm not talking about naming him Resume McResumeface. Your resume name should be \"Firstname Lastname Resume\". Don't include the job title on there, or any periods, underscores, or any other information. \"J\\_Smith Customer Support Rep. Resume V2 Final\" is everything wrong with a resume title. I hear you asking, \"But holly948, how do I have multiple resumes then for the different jobs I'm applying to?\".\n* **ALWAYS SEND YOUR RESUME AS A PDF DOCUMENT!!** If you send it through as a Word document, their computer could mess with the formatting and it could ruin the perfect look of your resume. PDF will ensure they view it exactly how you have designed it to look. Sending through as a Word doc could ruin all of the hard work you put into the formatting. Devastating!\n\n# COVER LETTERS\n\nI'm sorry that's not my area, and I loath cover letters with a passion. Write them or don't, whatever. I personally never write cover letters as I find they are a waste of my time.\n\n# AKSHUALLY...\n\nLastly, I hear many of you about to furiously get into the comments with \"but my experience was...\" and \"in my opinion, you should...\", and \"actually, I think...\" and I get it! There is no \"one perfect way\" and everyone has different opinions. **This entire write up is in MY opinion and MY experience.** I'm not saying don't comment, just, please take this post as my opinion rather than \"it must be done exactly how I say or else you're never getting a job and your resume sucks\". Do whatever you want, man. Different things work for different companies and industries. This is my own general advice, and I know with resumes there is no \"one size fits all\". No two resumes I do are the same, because it comes down to the individuals experience, education, interests, what they're applying to and so many other factors. I'm just giving free advice from my own experience, in my own opinion, to serve the majority of people updating their resumes (primarily in North America).\n\n\\~\n\n**TL;DR** \\- **if you want to improve your resume, then I've given you everything you need minus the template.** **However, I'm doing up a template at the moment, and will share with you all, hopefully this weekend.** I want to give you all of the tools you need to succeed.\n\n*Enjoyed my advice from this post and/or the last? You can buy me a coffee!* [*https://www.buymeacoffee.com/holly948*](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/holly948)\n\nI sincerely hope this has helped, and I wish you all the best of luck in your job searches!",

    "text": "Dealing with resentment from being fired from a job So I was fired in March 2023 from a job  as a marketing consultant and it’s now July and I still feel bit  of rage and resentment about it.  Mainly just because of how I was fired which was done in a very sneaky, underhanded way. Additionally, I was given a weak/ vague excuse of just “job performance” it definitely just felt personal.  Also, I feel angry still is because looking back there were so many times I wish I had spoken up when I felt disrespected, or simply overwhelmed with zero help.\n\nFor context, the company I worked for was a small team of 16 people. I was the only black person with the rest mostly being white and conservative. My tasks included marking stuff like social media posts, graphic design,  web site management, press releases , company news letters, event assistance/ media coverage. I had to cover the receptionist whenever they were out of office or on  “vacation” and do their daily tasks ( which was a frequent thing).  To top it one, I regularly had to deal with a arrogant  micromanaging douchebag supervisor who criticized everything along with his female stooge. \n\nI admit I made mistakes but I was bussing my butt every day and constantly juggling my job and the receptionist job all the time. Near the end, I was having health related problems due to the stress of the job ( random nose bleeds,  lack of sleep, panic attacks). \n\nNonetheless, I will be starting another job soon ( not my ideal position but decent for now).  But it still eats me up that a toxic company is thriving. But I am still trying to just move forward and out the anger and resentment away.  Any advice to help just move on from this?",

    "text": "The Dehumanization of the Job Market: My Frustrations with ATS Scans and Ignorant Recruiters The job market has become increasingly dehumanized, leaving job seekers feeling frustrated and undervalued. ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scans have become a ubiquitous part of the hiring process, often filtering out resumes before a human being even has a chance to see it. Recruiters and hiring managers have become so focused on filling a role that they often forget that there are real people behind those resumes, with hopes, dreams, and families.\n\nAs a job seeker, it's disheartening to spend hours crafting a resume and cover letter, only to be filtered out by an algorithm that may not even take into account the full scope of our qualifications and experiences. It's frustrating to see our job applications disappear into a black hole, never to receive any feedback or acknowledgement.\n\nBut it's not just the ATS scans that are the problem. Recruiters and hiring managers have also become disconnected from the human aspect of the hiring process. Many are so overwhelmed by the volume of applications they receive that they don't take the time to respond to candidates, let alone provide constructive feedback.\n\nIt's not uncommon for job seekers to send heartfelt inmails on LinkedIn, only to be ignored by an arrogant recruiter who may not even realize the impact of their dismissiveness. This kind of treatment can leave job seekers feeling like they don't matter, like they're just another faceless candidate in a sea of applications.\n\nThe dehumanization of the job market is not only frustrating for job seekers, but it also undermines the hiring process. By focusing solely on qualifications and experiences, employers miss out on the potential for a great candidate who may not check all the boxes on paper but has the potential to bring new perspectives and ideas to the role.\n\nAs job seekers, it's important to remember that we are more than just our resumes. We have unique experiences, skills, and passions that can bring value to an organization. It's up to us to keep pushing forward, despite the dehumanization of the job market. And it's up to recruiters and hiring managers to remember that there are people behind those resumes, and to treat candidates with the respect and dignity they deserve.\n\nIn conclusion, the job market has become increasingly dehumanized, leaving job seekers feeling undervalued and frustrated. While ATS scans and overwhelmed recruiters may seem like insurmountable obstacles, it's important to remember that we are more than just our resumes. By continuing to push forward and reminding recruiters and hiring managers of our humanity, we can work to create a more equitable and respectful hiring process.",

    "text": "I Got Approached By A Male Grocery Employees In The Bathroom This happened around an hour ago.  I was in the grocery store and had to pee before I grabbed my groceries, so I went to the restroom.  I was the only one there.  I have gone to this restroom countless times in the past with no problems.\n\nAs I'm wiping and about to stand up, I hear a man call something out in Spanish as he enters the bathroom.  I don't speak Spanish and I just thought it was a guy that opened the wrong door.  I hear the door close and someone bang on the stall door and he says something in Spanish again.  I call out, \"I'm in here\" and I pull up my pants and flush the toilet.\n\nI realize that he's still standing outside the stall as I'm washing my hands.  Now I'm confused and concerned.  I dry my hands and open the stall door and I'm confronted with a male store employee.  He just says to me \"okay\" and nods.  I ask him if there's a problem and he just repeats \"okay\".\n\nWe both leave the restroom and a female employee is standing outside the restroom and she has an expression of \"oh shit\" when I walk out.  That's when I realized that I've been mistaken as a man.  I have very short hair (a 1 for those that know how hair clippers work), I'm 5'10\", around 275 lbs.  I also have huge tiddies and wide hips.  I was wearing a cap, a t-shirt, blue jeans, and sneakers.  I just got off work.\n\nI got annoyed then asked them, \"Do you wanna see my bloody pad as proof that I'm a woman?\".  I went to the seafood counter and as I'm waiting for my turn with the fishmonger, I keep thinking about what just happened and I just feel worse and worse.  I text my friends with what happened and they told me to leave and I started crying.\n\nI went to a manager and explained what happened.  He reviews the camera that is pointed at the restroom hallway and tells me he knows who they were and they left for the day.  I left my name and number with him to call me back tomorrow, but I'm never going back to that chain again.\n\nEven if I was a man, I was voiding my bladder.  A toilet is a toilet is a toilet.  I was alone in the bathroom until the male employee entered and made me feel like I shouldn't be pissing in the ladies toilet.  Even if I had nefarious intent, I was alone in the bathroom and neither of these employees were managers.  There was a female manager on duty because she tried to comfort me as I cried at the customer service counter.\n\nI'm a big, fat, black woman and I'm tired of having to justify the fact that I exist as I am.  Why can't people just mind their business?\n\nI'm just tired and humiliated.\n\nFUCK KEY FOODS SUPERMARKET!",

    "text": "2 days after my boyfriend raped me. Thank you to all the redditors for the kind messages from my previous post \n\nI went to the ER and underwent a sexual assault exam. I went by myself and I couldn’t really talk at certain times so I had to write in text. I broke down in tears screaming when a nurse gave me a hug and I’m quite a shy person who has never done anything like this in public and felt so embarrassed. \n\nThankfully I don’t have any major injuries but bruises and abrasions. It was awkward to get swabbed all over but I managed to get through. She asked the tough question of reporting it and I chose not to report it now. I didn’t want to be there but because it was necessary and get a plan-B, I was not ready and physically capable of going through a report. She was very understanding and comforting, providing me her personal number to call at anytime and organized a time with a counselor. \n\nMost redditors suggested I save evidence but I had gone home and immediately washed my clothes and had a bath, but I found my socks from that night which had blood that was kept. \n\nMy mind just keeps playing that night, degrading things he used to do to me and trying to solve this puzzle wondering if I was actually very naive to think he actually cared about me. Just remembering now last week he would set me scenarios of why I consider my virginity sacred and how even if I was to lose it without my control I would never tell my parents. I didn’t think much of it when we were having this conversation. \n\nSo many people asking me about how he finished: He pinned my hands down and remember him being so violent with a menacing face, shouting and dripping in sweat (which I had a nightmare to) I can’t unsee that face. And yes he did inside me and fell on to me without taking it out and fell asleep on me. His last words were “happy fucking birthday to me”. I wanted to simply die. \n\nEveryone asks me if I’m okay: I am numb. I can’t really feel myself, I have been having water, one cereal bar since Friday night. I haven’t spoken to anyone or shared about this with anyone close yet. And I don’t think I have or know anyone I can trust with it. \n\nI’m terrified of going to school and seeing him. I just turned on my phone after shutting it down since last night. He has messaged and called me a number of times asking what’s up. I have not replied to him. I need to gather my thoughts, properly before I can even think of seeing him to end it or talk about it because when spoke to him on Sunday he was confused as to what happened as he had “blacked out” \n\nI am hurting. I wanna end my life. I feel useless, dragged around, used and worthless. \n\nTo redditors of my post from last night: I am sorry if I came across as rude or mean from my responses. I overreacted and I shouldn’t have responded without having a clear head. I really do thank you for the very kind and heartwarming messages and prayers. It’s sweet but I hate feeling like a labeled victim now. But it’s sweet, you have made me cry and sometimes hopeful from your personal journeys as well to which I can relate. \n\nI’m sorry if I haven’t reached out to everyone as I was physically unable to do so. Writing and texting has been helping me a little",

    "text": "To those men who say “give him a chance” despite a nagging gut feeling \nBackground: I met this guy right after I got out of my abusive marriage. We were on and off friends for the past 2.5 years. I have done extensive therapy and work on myself during this time. \n\nSo this guy J 31M reaches out to me 29F and asks me on a date. I said yes and it was going well for the past few weeks. I was apprehensive about him and had several conversations about it with my aunt and 2 close friends. I just had a feeling that I still can’t place. \nWell que to yesterday we had plans for me to come over to his house and watch a movie. Well we were having trouble picking the movie. He suggests a DiCaprio movie, which I decline saying that I don’t support his work. He presses me an answer and I tell him I don’t support him because he preys on barely legal girls. So this guy J gets super upset and defensive. He starts saying that it’s typical for men to go after young girls like that. I asked him why he isn’t going for young girls and he deflected my question by asking why I’m not with a 35 year old (like that’s the same comparison) to which I responded “I haven’t found one, Is that why you’re not with an 18 year old because you haven’t found one” he didn’t like my response and told me that just because I was naive at 18 didn’t mean that ever girl that age is naive, he grew up early and I said I did too, he said no you didn’t I said yes I did you wouldn’t understand how I had to grow up early. He went ballistic on me. He started yelling so loud and made a comment about me leaving. He said I can leave if I can’t handle a disagreement. I just sat there as J screamed at me telling me about how he paid for his house cash and got himself to where he was because he’s done everything for himself. I let him scream for a while while I just stared and blinked at him, shocked really. I asked him if he was done? Not really even know what to say if he was done and his response was “no I’m not because anything you say is irrelevant. You come into my house…” I stood up grabbed my couple of things and headed for the door. J said “are you leaving” “YUP” and he said don’t forget this and threw something black towards me. I didn’t know what it was but I kept going for the door. He’s now yelling “if you leave, don’t come back”. I kept walking to my car and he’s coming after me “don’t forget this!” I get in my car and lock the door and start taking deep breathes. He comes to the passenger window and shows me my hair tie and says “don’t forget this!” I brush off with my hand and J throws the hair tie and says “if you leave don’t come back.” And walks away. \nI thought about it for a couple of minutes and left.\nHe blocked me off socials which was great because I was going to do that and sent him a final text message before blocking him. Telling him he needs to learn how to manage his anger and that in my house there’s no asshole who yells at me thinking that will resolve a disagreement, no one to make me feel small and no one to make me feel unwelcome without a voice. Then told him to have a good life and blocked him. \n\nAnd this is why we need to trust our gut feelings. I’m glad I worked through my trauma otherwise I would have reverted back to my placating techniques in the past. I’m sad but I’m also happy to see I’ve come a long way and am making healthier choices.",

    "text": "I'm fighting for Abortion Rights for all of us Hello,\nMy name is Carmen Broesder, and I'm a resident of Nampa, Idaho. I spent the majority of December enduring massive pain, hemorrhage, cramps, contractions, and periods of blacking out because of government regulations surrounding women’s health care.\n\nAfter 8 days, on my 3rd ER visit, I finally received minimal but life-saving care for my miscarriage. However, I still spent 11 more days bleeding and praying for my life, because doctor’s hands were tied by draconian legislation.\n\nIn total, I bled for 19 days. It took 25 more days to get confirmation that the heartbreaking miscarriage was finally over. My health crisis that began on 12/ 8 wasn’t over until the new year.\nI tried to speak to the legislators who are supposed to represent me. I started researching and found a plethora of similar legal problems and decided to ask for help. My representatives have stated openly that they won't listen to me. Rather, they mock me and repeatedly block me, thereby violating my First Amendment rights.\n\nIdahoans are under attack by our Republican representatives. They are using their personal and religious agendas to hurt their people.\nWe are fighting back, but we need help.\n\nWe need a lawyer willing to fight this government overreach on a national level because abortion regulations have been implemented that shouldn't exist. The three-fold increase in maternal death is a clear indication that this is a war on pregnant people. The current slew of abortion regulations do not only impact families seeking abortion, rather they negatively impact every aspect of reproductive healthcare. \n\nMiscarriage management, birth control options, and infertility care are all being eviscerated as a result of the government’s intrusion into personal medical decisions. Forced pregnancy not only violates international law, not only violates the separation of church and state, but also risks women’s lives. Pregnancy is the most dangerous time in most women’s lives- every pregnancy puts a woman’s life at risk.\n\nWe need a lawyer to coordinate with the ACLU, for our rights to bodily autonomy and our constitutional rights as citizens and human beings...\n\n\n Given my recent experience with an inhumanly managed miscarriage, I have the standing to challenge the religious fundamentalists who run Idaho in Federal Court. My plan is for my legal counsel to work with the ACLU, for additional support. Roe V Wade has been overturned, it’s time for Broesder V Idaho.\n\nThank you all so much. This is all new to me. I appreciate your kindness and support.\n\nCarmenbroesder.com",

    "text": "NYT: How Unconscious Bias in Health Care Puts Pregnant Black Women at Higher Risk This is so heartbreaking and rage-inducing:\n\n“Black women , who die of pregnancy-related complications at two to three times the rate of white women, say that remarks like these, often made when they are most vulnerable, reflect pervasive bias in the medical system. They report that medical staff don’t listen to them when they complain of symptoms, and dismiss or downplay their concerns. Studies validate their experiences: Analyses of taped conversations between physicians and patients have found that doctors dominate the conversation more with Black patients and don’t ask as many questions as they do of white patients. In medical notes, doctors are more likely to express skepticism about the symptoms Black patients report.”\n\n[Full article here.](https://hellogloria.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2f3fcc3ceb62e0def41c350dd&id=440cb035b9&e=e38bbbac18)",

    "text": "It's easier being a thin woman, but still scary as hell sometimes I think fatphobia against women is well documented in feminist spaces, the medical discrimination, lack of access to clothing, mockery in the media etc\n\nWhen I  was fat I still got by, I was not from a good background or had many privileges but my mom taught me to be a social and kind-hearted person I got out there, was in a band, did dance classes, and was friends with other fat people.\n\nbut the relentless bullying at school and media imagery I saw was pretty insurmountable, my weight was a constant source of shame. Fat women have it harder in society, hands down.\n\nClient-facing jobs were not going to happen, I  applied for a receptionist job once and accidentally was sent a reply that was not supposed to go to me, saying \"Her typing skills are excellent, she sounds really good, but she's huge!\". When I eventually got a waitressing job (mostly due to my polyglot status), I used to be scolded pretty hard at work for small mistakes. i got assumed to be more junior than i was.\n\nboyfriends were always a secret, like I was an embarrassment to be seen with, so I didn't maintain any of the relationships, I tried to keep my self-respect. I was mostly invisible to men around me, it was nice because especially working late at night I didn't want trouble. That's not to discount the experiences of big women who have had harassment happen to them, just my experience. I hear in the USA it's more common for fat black women cus of how their bodies are uniquely sexualised, where here in my country drunk dudes pretty street harassment seems to even conform to beauty standards.\n\nAfter weight loss, I discovered some hard truths though and have faced different kinds of gender-inequality.\n\nI was pretty much immediately offered a promotion to a  customer-facing role, customers were far kinder and patient with me,  even offering to help me carry things, and managers stopped scolding me if i was working slowly.\n\nall social interactions became easier u/verycoolbutveryugly said \" I don’t expect people to be attracted to me...What absolutely breaks my heart is how much easier it has been for  me to make *friends* as I’ve lost  weight. Men give me more flirty attention, whatever. But women are  nicer to me as friends. Men are nicer to me as friends. It’s heart  breaking. I don’t trust anyone anymore. \"\n\nother thin people will also comment on people's weight when they are not around, i was in the swimming pools minding my own business when a guy, total stranger, taps my shoulder, points to an obese woman and says \"looks a whale.\" fucking asshole. even like, trying to discuss with mutual friends who we could set Gemma up on a date with, they are like \"well shes big so we dont have many options...\" apparently this was a normal part of thin social interactions i didn't know about....\n\nthe sudden hypersexualization of my body was also really hard to deal with,  performing on stage, punk music, i stopped being called 'brave' but called 'sexy', despite wearing the exact same kinds of gothy/punky costumes as when i was big,\n\nmen hit on me a lot - i like to go out for dancing with the girls not flirting, total strangers are way more comfortable touching me (my arm,  my back, my hand) when giving directions etc, and worst,  I've been followed home and had to change course.\n\nI  also felt really hurt when a few of my close male friends suddenly started inviting me to all kinds of events with them, offering me tickets/drinks etc to get me to come, like our years of friendship and  being there for them was not important enough, but now that i looked different i could be worthy to be seen on a date with them :(\n\nbeing fat meant facing work discrimination, health risks and social exclusion, the heightened harassment I'm dealing with now from men is easier than losing job opportunities and bullying i guess\n\nthere are heaps of privileges from being thin, better work treatment, able to do sport, join in dress ups with the girls, not scared of taking photos, thrifting, easier to make small talk/get new friends, heaps more, but wanted to just give a perspective that weight loss might bring different, scary, forms of gender-based inequality in case any fat woman is reading this thinking of weight loss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dunnno what else I'm trying to say, just.... respect fat staff at work and don't sexualise people without their consent? that feels like obvious advice in a feminist sub.....\n\ndisclaimer: beauty standards harm men too!!!!....men don't like it when it's not all about them for 5 minutes so, that's me paying up dues.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "text": "My workplace is literally 99% young women. Last night after we closed a creepy man was loitering outside, waiting for my coworker and I to leave. It was scary. I’m still a little shaken up by this. I’m a VERY petite woman who lives in a relatively safe town. You don’t often hear about this kind of thing happening. I’m 24, and was working with my 21 yo coworker. She’s only a little taller than me; both of us are pretty small.\n\nImmediately after we closed the store (at 8:29 instead of 8:30 because we wanted to go home lol) we went outside to collect the outside trash to take it to the dumpster. It’s a rule at our work that we must take out the trash in pairs at night.\n\nWhile my coworker was waiting for me to finish tying up the garbage bag so we could walk it to the trash, this old guy in his 60s(?) kept trying to talk to us. I honestly didn’t absorb jack shit of what he said because we just closed and I was trying to go about with my own business. But my coworker later told me he was trying to make conversation about the weather. She smiled at him but neither of us responded to him. I expected him to leave but he didn’t. Then he said something else about the weather and didn’t get a response again. He still just kept standing there. Then he said something about, “I don’t know why everyone thinks I’m an asshole” and put on a black face scarf. I saw this too. My alarm bells went off. From the spot he was standing in, he was kind of cornering us into the patio area. I said to my coworker, “Y’know what, I think we forgot to do something. Let’s head back in to get that done before we go.” I’m so glad I followed my intuition and that she didn’t question my excuse. She was creeped out too.\n\nAfter we got inside and locked the door we immediately talked about how weird and creepy that guy was??? We planned to finish up the other closing duties before taking out the trash so we could wait for him to leave but he was standing there waiting for us. FOR LIKE 15-20 MINUTES. Several times we kept wondering, “Is he still there?” and peeked out the window to see him standing there in the dark, with a face scarf and bucket hat on, staring at the store. We don’t have a back door. He was standing at the only exit.\n\nI quickly took a picture of him, for evidence I guess? The photo I got didn’t capture any notable features because in the dark he was just a black silhouette. Maybe that was a stupid thing to do because he saw me. He started knocking on our door! We didn’t answer obviously. We were freaked out and wanted to get out of there ASAP. Fuck the rest of the closing duties lol we needed to leave.\n\nI called one of the businesses next to us to ask if they could send someone to walk us to the trash and our cars. They didn’t answer (I think they were closed) so I tried the restaurant across the street. Thankfully they did answer. I explained the situation and the employee on the phone said she’d send her manager who’s “very big and scary.” The manager came over, and he was a very tall but  lean and kinda scrawny guy. I found a little bit of humor in that lmao 😅. He came over with another male employee too.\n\nWe thanked them profusely and they walked us to the trash. We passed the creepy guy and he said something to us, I have no idea what, my brain couldn’t process it for some reason. I think I just wanted to focus on leaving while acting normal. After taking out the trash we had to walk back around the corner near the spot he was standing and he was gone. The employees walked us to our cars and we got the heck out of there lol. I made my coworker text me when she got home safe. Then I started a GC with our manager and told her about the situation. (When I gave a physical description of the guy and mentioned his grey stubble she said “Ew he sounds gross” LMAO that made me feel a bit better about everything somehow). I have to file an incident report when I go back into work today.\n\nThis whole situation was pretty terrifying. My workplace is full of teenage and early 20s girls. We’re really vulnerable. I’m glad I go outwardly deadpan and emotionless in situations like these, because I had my wits about me and was able to make some good decisions while being calm.\n\nOne thing I kind of wish I did was call the police. When the creepy guy started knocking on the door I was contemplating calling 911. This probably sounds kinda stupid but I was afraid of them not taking us seriously. What if they were like “Maam this isn’t an emergency, next time call the non-emergency line” or what if they took eons to show up? I’m also a little scared of the police after everything that happened in 2020. I doomscrolled a lot back then and saw too many videos of police either abusing their power or being completely useless. I’m half Asian and easily white passing but as a really tiny woman I’m really easily intimidated. My manager said that if this happens again to go ahead and call the cops. I’m going to warn all the other girls who work closing shifts too, because I feel like this creep will probably show up again.\n\nThat’s it. I guess I just needed to get this out, and to have something to help me file an incident report at work later. After work I went over to my godparents house (my only family, also I live alone and was not in the mood to return to my dead silent house at night). That helped a lot and they made me feel safe for a bit.\n\nNever posted here before. I’m looking forward to my free Reddit Cares handout that everyone seems to get! 🤲",

    "text": "Being a nurse is hard however being a black nurse is harder and to put icing on the cake a new grad at that. Ps. This is coming from a white girl I salute every black nurse. Yesterday our nurse educator brought 2 black new grads up to the floor to introduce everyone to them and get a feel of what the floor will be like. The nurse manager didn’t even acknowledge them. I was surprised by this. One of the girls I felt like she caught on to the facial expressions so she didn’t even bother speaking to the manager. However, the second girl politely greeted her and the way our unit manager answered back was so unprofessional. The second girl was brought back up today to the unit and she didn’t say hello to the nurse manager which I was glad she didn’t. But I feel so bad for them because being new grads you’ll need all the support and having a unit manager act like this is toxic af to your learning ability. This is what’s pushing new grads away from bedside and then you wonder why you're short staffed. Patients are already racist at times towards my fellow black colleagues but to also experience racism and toxicity from a colleague is just adding on to the stress. It's just so disheartening.\n\nEdit: Some of the comments that I was receiving from this post proved my point. Some were obviously triggered because this is how they treat their fellow black colleagues. It's time to get used to having different people from different backgrounds in the same space as you or you'll just have no choice but to get used to it. It's time to start being open minded!\n\nEdit 2: To the people that commented saying to say it's racism is not okay, then what is it? It's 2023 people, nobody is booboo the fool. We all know words mean so little and your body language, attitude and facial expressions shows how you truly feel.",

    "text": "I may have rage quit my PRN job after getting punched in the face… I recently started a new ER job in a wealthy suburb but stayed PRN in the city ER I’ve been at for years, nervous I would hate the clientele. \n\nIn the month that I have been there, I have not been assaulted, verbally abused, heck people have barely even been rude. \n\nThe shift I had at the city last night will be my last. \n\nWas not expecting it to be. I hadn’t had a shift in a minute, and everyone was really happy to see me which made me feel great. \n\nBut of course I came in to a full ER and waiting packed room and was given a group of beds in the hallway. Cool, I thought. Probably gonna get a bunch of easy 3s from the waiting room. \n\nNope. Back to back to back ambulances. Could barely finish triaging one before I got another, had to manually take vitals because I didn’t have a working vitals machine, and they were ALL inappropriate for the hallway. \n\nI finally finish the last’s triage when a cardiac arrest comes in. There are no techs so it’s just me and another nurse switching meds and compressions. We finally call it and I finally go back to my pod, very winded, and someone complains that they’ve been sitting there for an hour and I haven’t done a thing for them. Typical. \n\nI’m rushing to line and lab my very sick pod when the least sick of them, who came in very pleasant, starts to yell about wanting to go home and that I’m mistreating her. I realize she’s sundowning, but make a bit of a show of trying to reason with her because the other three hallway beds have full view of the scene. Of course it doesn’t work. \n\nThe doc needed info from her nursing home. The phone I had was missing the cord so I could only talk on speaker. They hung up on me because they couldn’t hear me over the patient yelling. \n\nThen I get a critical for another patient. Hgb 3.2. I tell charge this patient needs a room. There are none.\n\nIm trying to type and screen the low hgb when grandma ends up wiggling her way to the foot of the bed with her leg stuck in the side rail. I grab another nurse to help me get her back up in bed. \n\nThe second I let go, she punches me in the face. \n\n“Hey. Not okay. Ma’am, if you hit someone again we’re going to have to put you in restraints” \n\nShe swings again. \n\nSo now I’m putting her in softs while she screams that she did not hit me and that I am racist (I’m white and work with a primarily black population) \n\nAt this point, there’s a visitor of a roomed patient standing in the hall with her arms crossed glaring at me like I’m the devil. I politely ask her to step back inside the room, and she responds “I’m good right here. People like me and her need to look out for each other.” \n\nMy heart SANK y’all. I take no pleasure in restraining and sedating anyone. I try to empathize with the tendency to think an HCW is being racist, but it really hurts my feelings when I get accused of it. \n\nThis visitor ends up talking to the assistant manager about me. Bro does not stand up for me at all and he too questions my actions until security confirms the strike was caught on camera. \n\nAnd then what do I get?? The classic “what do you think you could have done differently” \n\nMy guy, I just got punched in the face. You didn’t even ask me if I’m okay, and after knowing me for years still questioned my ethics. We don’t have time for this. Someone else here desperately needs blood. \n\nEmbarrassingly, I am in tears when I tell him I am done, he needs to take my patients, and this will be my last shift. I let some other coworkers know I won’t be returning and give a few hugs on the way out. Got in my car and never looked back. \n\nI did get a text from the educator that heard what happened, asked if I was okay and said she was sorry to see me go. So that’s something. It really wasn’t the way I wanted to end my time there, getting emotional, but I was gonna need the push one way or another.",

    "text": "I was assaulted and battered at work by another nurse. I (M24 LPN) work at a Long Term Care/Skilled Nursing Facility in a rural part of the country. I work a 12 hour night shift with around 24 patients and 2 CNAs.   \n\n\nThere are 2 active halls with 2 medicine carts. For those that don't already know: they contain two locks: one for primary access to most medication cards and OTCs, and a secondary locked drawer that contains narcotics and sensitive personal belongings. e.g. Wallets, cash, wedding rings, stuff like that. These narcotic drawers have a dedicated narc book that is an additional paper MAR and a way to keep track of who gave what, to whom, and when. It's harder to divert when everyone pays attention to these, and we count the narcs every shift change. A bad count means drug tests for everyone until that missing pill or liquid discrepancy is addressed by management.    \n\n\nThis all started one windy night when my usual Thursday night work-bestie, Susan\\* called in. She usually works 'A' hall and I usually work 'B' hall. We're great together because we watch each others' backs and both hold a high standard of practice and patient care. Well, Karen^(\\*) comes in to cover her shift, and she only ever works 'B' hall because that's 'her hall' and she's never worked anything else in her years working there. That's fine, I work help out with 'A' hall all the time so I'm pretty familiar with them. The shift goes on.  \n\n\nAround 2300, Susan shows up. Much to our surprise, she didn't call in, she was just going to be a few hours late due to a security issue at her house in the sticks. Cool, I give a brief report to her (we had both worked these halls last night, so not much had changed.) and we count the narcotics on 'A' Hall's cart. All good. Karen wants to go home, this is her day off and she's willing to give up 'B' hall now that Susan is here. All good, I was gonna work that hall anyhow. We begin to count and something is amiss. Two pills missing out of a Tramadol card. Not good. I ask her where they are and she opens a drawer to reveal about 22 or so pill cups (some double stacked) of pills pre-popped for her 0600 medpass. It's 2310 at this point, waaaay before her 0600 medpass, and it turns out she had a few popped out for her 0000 medpass, too in a different drawer.   \n\n\n\"I got them popped and ready for you, I'll sign them out and just leave the signature part open for you.\"   \n\n\nYeah right, like I'm doing *that.* Karen has always been a lazy nurse who A.) never follows up on issues, and B.) hardly ever addresses a problem a resident has unless it's dire. She wouldn't address constipation in our chronic opiate taking patients unless she was badgered to by her fellow nurses. \n\nAll in all there were about 6 narcotics in these pre-popped pill cups that weren't signed out and weren't due for several hours. I took the time to visually identify each pill and compare each identifier to the card they were purportedly from. This isn't out of the realm of possibility with bad counts, as pills tend to fall out of these tin-foil backed cards. (See included imaged.) So, finding a pill and matching it to the card is sketch, but I was very confident that I had found each missing narcotic in each pill cup and that she hadn't just stolen them and pulled the wool over my eyes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I took the cart, got report, and texted my DON and administrator. Then, one of my fav CNAs that does her job and is accommodating to resident needs approaches me and tells me that Karen admitted to her that she showed up to *this* shift ***drunk!***  She smelled the alcohol on her breath and stated she was acting weird. I should have caught this, and I didn't. I had a bad head cold and couldn't smell C-diff if you put it in my yogurt, but I should have noticed the behavior. Mind, I hadn't spent more that a few minutes talking to her at this point it was pretty close after nighttime medpass. 2000, 2100, and 2200 meds aren't uncommon in this LTC/SNF facility. So Mepass can drag.   \n\n\nSo, I do what we do and I call my DON. We're in a rural territory and phone reception is bad, so I never get her on the phone until later in her morning commute. My administrator picked up, though, and I tell her the whole spiel. She advises me to not pass ***any*** of the medications pre-popped and to positively identify all the narcotics missing from the cards and waste them. \"Do what you need to do to protect your license.\" Well, duh I'm not passing those meds. She was dumbfounded when I told her about the drinking. I'd thought I lost the call for a minute. So, Susan and I spend some time identifying and wasting all the pills. Count is good, and we co-sign all the wasting. Witness statement was taken from the CNA that Karen admitted the drunkenness to, and that's that.   \n\n\nAround 0530 my DON calls me back, I fill her in and DON says she's glad because she can finally fire Karen for all her sucky nursing and now this incident with the drinking and pre-popping. Karen is summarily fired and the rumor mill boils with the news. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Part II: 'You ruined my life.'***   \n\n\nSo, we pick up about 2 weeks later. It's Thanksgiving 2023 and I'm on the shift. Me, Susan, and a cool day-shift nurse named Lina are all chilling right before medpass when I see Karen walk into the door on 'B' Hall^(\\*\\*). My 'oh-crap-meter' pings to max and I tell Susan and Lina what's up. We're all alert, but they stay at the nurse's station. I grab a med to give down the hall and I see her in a resident's room, so I wave and say: \"Hey Karen!\" as polite as I can muster, which is pretty darn nice.   \n\n\n\"F!@# OFF!\" she replies, in her willowy wail of a voice.   \n\n\nThat's when I knew I had to ask her to leave. You've already dishonored our profession by taking care of my resident's drunk, but you're not going to further stain this place by screaming and cursing in their home. I pass the room without missing a beat and give the medication, wait for the resident to swallow and turn heel toward the room. She's making her way toward the nurses' station at the center of the facility and I call out to her. \"Karen, hey Karen!\" she spots a friendly CNA to chat up when I catch up to her. She ignores me until:  \n\n\n\"Karen, I'm going to ask you to leave. You can't be cursing and yelli-\"  \n\n\nK: \"F!#\\* off, you don't TALK TO ME! You RUINED MY LIFE!\" The Karen sprays, pointing an accusatory finger at my face.   \n\n\nMe: \"If you don't leave I am calling the police.\"  \n\n\nShe says some more heinous stuff and every conceivable insult to my person and manhood she can think of in her clearly drunk state. Lina and Susan catch wind of this and rush over, I don't notice because I'm locked on with full adrenaline as I pull out my phone to dial 911. She knocks the phone out of my hand. (Assault #1), then she begins walking from whence she came down 'B' Hall. I collect my phone and the three of us follow her down the hall, I dial 911 and begin making my report. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nName, location, situation. The operator hears me clearly and all the things Karen is bellowing in front of all her previously beloved residents (mine now, Karen.) as she generally makes a donkey of herself. Then she hears me say. \"She's around 63 years old.\" Genuinely, this was not meant as a slight. She was 52, but a life of alcoholism, smoking, and a dip or two into the meth and local gene pool had withered her body. She had that Palpatine complexion.   \n\n\nShe heard this, whirled on me and yowled: \"Sixty three?! Oh, no you didn't motherfu@#er!\" I didn't see the slap coming, but my head turned all the way left and my glasses landed on the floor to my right. (Battery #1) and then she knocked the phone out of my hand again. (Assault #2)^(\\*\\*\\*.) My adrenaline is red-lining so I don't even register any pain. I pick up my glasses and phone. \"Sorry operator, she just slapped me.\" (A CNA would later tell me that he heard the slap all the way up the hall at the nurses station.)   \nWe follow her to the door. She punches in the code and exits to her car. I start to punch in the code behind her and my fellow nurses: Susan and Lina very wisely advise me to desist exiting the building where the drunk madwoman can run me over. I had no intention to do so, and Inform them I only want her license plate. So, that's what I do, I call out the license plate to the operator and then I get real spooked for the first time in this encounter. She spins out in the gravel lot and turns her car toward the door. She accelerates and stops just short of the brick that juts out of the entryway. I took a huge step back, because her little black Honda could totally make it into the hall if she'd kept going.  \n\n\nThen she takes off.   \n\n\nSheriff comes, Susan knows where she lives and tells the Sheriff.    \n\n\nPolice come, I give my statement, ask if I should press charges when the cop says. \"Oh, I'm puttin' charges on her. New law just passed, assault of a healthcare worker is a felony now.\" Plus, they had to wrestle her down in her front yard. No DUI, though :(  \n\n\nIt's thanksgiving, Thursday night, so no judge is available to  arraign her until Monday morning. I bet that hangover in jail was plenty of time to contemplate. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe got out that Monday and we changed to codes to the doors. My phone was damaged but ultimately fine.   \n\nHere's where she really hurt me. Turns out, she had gone into at least 2 resident's rooms and told these little, old, vulnerable ladies that I was going to hurt them, lie to them, and put my hands on them. One believed her. Months of effective therapeutic communication ruined. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll good though, time to get a restraining order. \n\n  \n\n\n[This is an example of our medicine cards. ](https://preview.redd.it/yd1s05kd4p3c1.jpg?width=890&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e293a9d1504841f978366e4f10e3db710c47980)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\\*^(Names have been changed,) \n\n\\*\\*^(Many nursing homes in my area are built with glass security doors at the end of each hall in the case of an emergency.

    "text": "Her goals of care were never addressed... It wasn't my patient, but I was charge nurse. On Wednesday morning around 0500 I entered the room with the primary and an international nurse on orientation to find the pt agonal breathing without a pulse.\n\nWe dropped the bed, started CPR, and called a code blue. With every compression, more and more black sludge was pouring out of her mouth. The code team arrived, she was intubated, we gave her sodium bicarb and we gave her epi. The code team did a lot more, honestly I don't remember everything that happened because I was so disturbed by having to do compressions on this frail woman. I can still hear and feel her ribs cracking.\n\nShe was a 77yo woman who had a hip fracture repaired a week ago and she had been refusing almost all treatment. Refusing to eat, sometimes refusing her PO meds, refusing pain medication, refusing physio, refusing to be repositoned in bed... She had developed a pneumonia and she was having soft black stools, but she was also on daily iron. \nEarlier that night her resps were like 40, the primary informed the surgeon and he ordered ativan and for her VS to be done q4h... We were also short staffed, had received 4 admissions, got 4 pts back from surgery, we had an epidural on the floor and another pt with a critical lactate who needed a blood tranfusion.\n\nThe code was called after 45minutes, the pt passed. The surgeon came to the floor, told the primary that the family was coming in to see the pt and said to some other nurses that \"it didn't look like we knew what we were doing\". \n\nWe cleaned the pt up the best we could, but she still had that black sludge in her hair and she was going to be a medical examiners case so everything we inserted into her during the code couldn't be removed... \n\nI've been a nurse for a year and a half... After the code the primary and the international nurse were both crying, for different reasons. The primary thought she should have done more for the pt (despite the surgeon telling her not to), and should have known something was wrong because her resps were so high. The international nurse on orientation had never seen a pt die before, and this death was graphic and traumatic. I tried my best to console them and debrief, but I don't have that much experience to draw on. Of course this whole thing happened on night shift, when we operate as a skeleton crew in the hospital. \n\nMy manager was contacted. I heard that she's pissed off at the surgeon for never addressing the pt's goals of care. I had the pt for 4 hours the night before and I remember saying to my co-workers that there is no way she should be a full code. We're going to have an opportunity to debrief with the educator in the new year, 2 weeks after the fact though. \n\nI don't know. It's just been on my mind. I don't even know what it was that took her out. She was an ortho pt but seemingly had some horrible GI issues that no one picked up on? Does anyone have any words of encouragement? Or any comparable stories?",

People don't believe I'm as educated as I am. I'm a 6'3\" Black man. When I come to work, I often get mislabeled as CNA (LNA in some states), LPN, or ADN by patients, their family members, or hospital staff even though it has my credentials on my name tag. There is nothing wrong with those credentials, but I worked hard for my bachelor degree, and I always noticed that people won't attempt those same labels to my non-Black coworkers. It is pretty lame. I probably shouldn't tell them that I also can speak Mandarin and can do magic tricks with playing cards. \n\n2. Being told I'm not leadership material yet wanting me to train others. This is more specific. I have precepted multiple people, but the one that sticks out to me was precepting someone with way less experience (been a nurse for less than a year) and management chose this person for a promotional position over me. Definitely brought my piss to a boil.\n\n3. I have been reflecting on my own life more. I really have been thinking about how I want my life to be. This just doesn't feel right anymore, but I'm also conflicted because I can logic my way out of quitting permanently. Shoot! I even quit one time and became a teacher overseas and only came back because of family issues.\n\nAnyways, I can feel the burnout, but I'm just not at the point of cremation yet. More like a zombie or one of those pirates that stole the cursed gold in the Pirates of the Caribbean movie. \n\nStill don't know what to put this under. Burnout or rant... Maybe \"burnant\".

    "text": "Left residency after 2 months feeling hopeless I applied and interviewed for both er and med surg and they gave me a observation unit.\n\nI ofcourse being a new grad immediately accepted what ever they would give me.\n\nThe education portion of the residency program was great but it seemed disconnected to the actual unit. They would say at the end of classes but its different in the cdu.\n\nI ran into a issue with one of the two preceptors I was scheduled with. This preceptor the first week would leave me alone with patients and take selfies in the nurses station. This preceptor also would intervene to quickly and micro manage every little thing because I did not do it exactly her way.  This was not the case with the other preceptor. \n\nAfter a patient needed immediate intervention they left me in the room alone said do this and when I finished they were talking with someone at the nurses station about dating apps mean while my patients bo had barely improved. \n\nI gave it a bit before I decided to report this preceptor because I have heard can be rough in the first year. But after continuously back tracking i. Progress between the better preceptor and this oen I finally reported them when they became extremely hostile when I asked questions.  \n\nThis was the start of the end. The whole unit turned on me. Attitudes changed the next day and this preceptor constantly was trying to push for why people were being pulled into meetings about it.\nI meet with this preceptor after a meeting with the ad of the er who over saw our unit. When I met with ber I just said I was meeting with the admin to find better ways for me to communicate my needs like setting up code words instead of having to just have her fix things for me or words I can say when I need help. \n\nShe only pries about what the meetings were. So I finally got tired of it and told her ot was a way for me to find a better way to communicate my needs when I see her rolling her eyes when I ask for help or yelling at me or leaving me in a room alone week one.\n\nObviously this preceptor was toxic and horrible and I requested not to be with her. Sadly that ruined everything l because then my schedule became terrible had random preceptors every day zero consistency in evaluation and never knew what I needed to work on until pulled into improvement meetings. 2 months i acter constantly communicating I want more feed back because what i hear on the floor and what the ad tells me are way different I requested a formal written eval not only word of mouth. \n\nIt was five lines of super general terms that honestly I already was doing. They held me from going from residency phase to orientation stating I am not ready for an independent load. \n\nThis is where I really realized there was a severe disconnect from the unit and the residency program. \n\nI would get told I am not doing meds correct but literally following written hospital policy. Dont get me wrong there were definitely things I needed improvement upon but they were the things all new frad nurses work on for the first year not ground for threat of termination or withholding  movement to orientation. More effective time management having a smoother more reflexed work flow. Things like that.\n\nMy unit would claim I am unsafe with meds xais eI would not reschedule a non critical med that was schedule daily exactly 24 hours from when last given. \n Or that my ic piggy back skills were lacking xause I didnt fill up the chamber exactly the way my preceptor wanted versus what hospital policy states. The preceptor would then say I was allowing deed back and I was too black and white. Keep in mind I would not tell the preceptor this is wwhat the policy state untill they told me I was doinf it incorrectly and that is what they would report to the ad to prevent me from advancing to orientation. \n\nI came fo realize the whole situation as pure lateral violence and bullying and even the educators in the residency program didnt lien what was going on.\n\nI quit after two months when I realized there was no way to actually do right for my one primary preceptor and my ad told me it was purely his blessing that allowed my to continue. \n\nNow I am scared shitless and being told I should have stayed. ZI am the sole provider for my family and a day later I have already applied elsewhere. \n\nI feel like there is zero chance of getting into any hospital positions now and that I will be stick with low pay out patient situations. My girl friend felt like i should have applied else where while working but sadly one option I thought I had fell through \n\nAny feed back or discussion is highly welcome and would be appreciated.",

The teachers were completely confused because they've been saying it for years and asked for an explanation, but of course admin was not able to explain any of their reasoning behind it. One teacher (white woman) was specifically told that she \"doesn't understand the culture of the children (title one school, mostly African American)\" to which she reminded them that she is engaged to a black man and has a mixed race child. They didn't respond to that either and basically the teachers were told if they are ever heard saying it again, they would be fired. \n\nI tried searching this claim and found something about how it's equivalent to telling kids to \"shut up\", but even that seems like a stretch. Nothing about how it's racist. \n\nAnyone else ever heard this?\n\nEDIT:\nTo clarify: I don't think it's racist.

They came in 5 minutes late and hadn’t even sat down when they began to yell “You are NOT expelling our son, we’ve already tried every school within an hour from home and this was our last option.” Um, no you haven’t, you just refuse to get him transferred to alternative school.

Literally nobody brought race into it except them. (Note that these parents are white people.) I also brought up how he seems to be coming to school unwashed, and that he alone makes the whole classroom smell bad. Again, I was told “That’s racist!” \n\nI told them about how restraint is considered inhumane and how we can’t give him his prescribed sedatives, and I got told “You need to have better classroom management!” I have no idea why they blamed me when they already said that he acts like this at home too. \n\nLastly, I asked them to explain how I’m meant to do that when no strategy works and they just complain about it, and they cut me off and told me “If you continue to be so reckless, we ***WILL*** be suing.” They then walked out.

They remained in the building for a while after though.\n\nSchool administration backed the parents and told me that I need to do my job better, and that they will be replacing me due to my “inability to manage violence”. Um, no, I was the one who asked both school *and district* administration for help and got ignored by both. I did show them the documentation I had on him, and they didn’t even read it.

Our principal has been very strict about the no-phone policy, students are supposed to put their phone in a bin as they walk into the classroom and only take it out at the end of the block. The principal has been reprimanding this teacher because of phone usage in her classroom, and since I am trying to help her and I don't want her to get in trouble, when I saw a student on her phone I told her to either give it to me to put it in the bin, or do so herself, like I always do in this kind of situation. She kept it in her hand so I stood there waiting and hell broke loose...\n\nShe started yelling at me, telling me to leave her alone, she called me a b*tch multiple times, told me to go f*ck myself multiple times. 2 of her friends intervened and doubled down, yelled all kinds of profanities, and also called me a racist (these students were black but so is 80% of the class and the other 20% are Hispanic students, she was just the only one I saw on her phone).\n\nIn the end she put the phone in the bin and I walked away. At the end of class, I talked to her 1:1 explaining that I am trying to help, telling her that the school is strict on the policy (which she already knows) and I don't want the teacher to get in trouble. She was much calmer, she said she understood, and she even smiled. Even so, I am very ashamed to admit that I have been shaking and my heart has been racing since that happened and once the bell rang I hid in the bathroom to cry. I feel so stupid for reacting like this but unfortunately I am autistic and this kind of direct confrontation really takes a toll on me.\n \nEven though I really enjoy my job, I feel like I have no business working in education because I am weak and not assertive enough and I constantly get disrespected and walked over not just by students but colleagues as well. I feel stupid because I think I handled this very poorly but at the same time I don't know what I could have done differently besides minding my own business.

    "text": "Active Shooter? There's an app for that! Last week I had one of the most surreal and dystopian moments of my life. \n\nMy county has purchased and is requiring all teachers to install an app called Raptor, for us to use in the event of a natural disaster or active shooter situation. We had a meeting during our planning period last week to go over how to use the app. \n\nIf there's a 'threat' in the building, any teacher who sees it is supposed to grab their personal phone, open the app, and press a button that alerts everyone else in the school, PLUS the local police. \n\nWe then go ahead with our new lockdown policy, where the app will recommend what we should do (flee/take shelter/continue as usual) based on our proximity to the threat that was reported. The app requires GPS access so it (and the police) can know where in the building we are based on our phone. \n\nThen, all teachers are required to take roll on the app. It's connected to our LMS so it knows our current class, and there's also a spot to include the names of any students who have been forced to take shelter with us who aren't on our roll. Even better, there's a part where we are able to report *injuries.* We don't just mark students (and ourselves! they so thoughtfully reminded us to take time to report ourselves first) present- we have to mark whether they're injured or safe in the app. Theoretically, so the police know where the bodies are.\n\nI had to fight not to raise my hand at this meeting and ask, \"So if I'm shot, should I make sure to update my status in the app first before I die?\"\n\nThere's also a group chat feature for teachers to share information about whatever the current active threat is and for the police to send us direct messages. \n\nThis meeting actually made me dissociate for the first time in my life. It's clear this app was made with a lot of thought and consideration, but holy shit is this where we are as a society? The government and law enforcement won't do anything to prevent school shootings because the NRA has their collective balls in a vise, so fucking *google play* is stepping up to profit on the need for a way to manage someone coming into my workplace to murder me? And my job sees no problem with requiring me to *update an app with a list of casualties* in the event of an active shooter? This is some Black Mirror shit. \n\n Edit: I'm concerned by the number of people whose primary issue in all this is the part about being asked to use their personal device for work. As opposed to the part about how school shootings are so normalized that we're making apps to manage them more efficiently.",

    "text": "Is this violence normal? First year 6th grade history teacher needs advice This is my first year teaching. I'm 6th grade US History. It's been just over a month. I'm at a rural, low income, high risk, predominantly black school (the last part shouldn't matter, but I'll explain.) I was warned by hr when I was hired that the kids have behavioral issues and to reach out if I wasn't being supported. \n\nIn my first week, there were multiple fights in my class. One student threw a chair at my screen board. The students actively told me they were trying to get me fired, would lie to the admin, and were misbehaving to get me to quit. Of course, I told them that wasn't going to leave and to cut it out so we can learn. \n\nOver the month, most of the students have calmed down. Some enjoy my class and are actually learning. About a third are still being rambunctious. They curse in class, bully other students, don't do their work, refuse to sit in their assigned seat, still throw things. There's been multiple fights in my class too. Another teacher asked one of those students why they only act this way in my class and not for any other teacher. He responded \"because you're black\". (I'm the only white teacher in the grade).\n\nI'm also having issues with their IEPs. The SPED teacher hasn't been following their accommodations so most of those kids are failing. Yet I'm suppssed to provide read aloud accomodations to a student who doesn't have an iep. I have referred this student for evaluation twice and have been ignored. I also had to restrain a student with a 504 because she was charging at another student to fight them. I reported my use of restraint, but the administration didn't report it to the state as required. \n\nI've told admin all of this as it has happened. I've asked for disciplinary policies and procedures for when kids are being violent multiple times. The admin hasn't been able to provide any direction besides call the parents. Well I do that and it does nothing. The parents say they'll discipline, but they come right back doing the same stuff the next day. (BTW, our class phones don't have outbound call access. I have to use my personal phone...).\n\nThe admin scheduled a meeting with me this week saying I need to learn how to manage my classroom because writing 10 referrals a week is bad. I explained everything above again and asked again for assistance in doing that by receiving written policies and procedures. They claimed this was there first time hearing about it (lie) and provided nothing.\n\nThey said I need to have better lesson plans that engage the students every minute. I offered to pull up my lesson plans to show them that is done. I also explained that we haven't been able to complete the activities I do plan because of the behavioral issues. \n\nThey proceeded to tell me that they didn't have these issues before I got here, basically saying these kids are violent because of me. I reminded them that the kids have said they don't respect me because of my race and are trying to get me fired. The conversation continued to revolve around how poorly I'm doing. I reminded them that I am an emergency provisional, untrained, uncertified teacher and that I need support. \n\nEverything I suggested was given a no. We don't have security to call. I can't call the police. I can't send disruptive kids to the hall. I can't give them worksheets to keep them occupied. They refuse to suspend kids and if they do it's not for more than a day. ISS is usually only used for that class period and they return for the next. \n\nIs this normal? Admin tried to tell me this is how it is at every school and I need to just get used to it. \n\nI truthfully don't know what to do. I enjoy my job. The \"good\" students enjoy my class. The other teachers tell me I'm doing a great job. \n\nI can't stop thinking about how they are blaming me for the violence. These are long standing behavioral issues that are happening in every grade at the school. If the worst were to happen, a school shooting imo, I have no way to get help. I wouldn't be able to live with the fact that the adults blame me for the violence. \n\nI'm not sure what to do and I need advice. I can reach out to HR, but that will strain my relationship with admin more. I'm planning on sending a recap email of the meeting with my questions about procedures in writing. I make good money, but the districts closer to my family are paying more...\n\nShould I look elsewhere? Should I try to make this work? Should I escalate to HR? I truly don't know how to handle this.",

    "text": "How to deal with entitled parents? I teach 4th in a Title 1 school. I would've never expected so much parent entitlement from this school setting, but this year most of my prep time has been spent dealing with student issues and demanding parents (and it's always the rich white parents who are in the minority at my predominantly Black school). It almost feels as though I'm punished for telling these parents anything contrary to the idea that their sweet little baby is perfect and can do no wrong. For example, I set up a meeting with a parent because I noticed a decline in a student's work. Mom reacted with anger, was skeptical of MY teaching, threatened to go to my principal, and is now emailing every day or every few days asking for \"data to back up the interventions I have put in place.\" With another kid, I wrote home to tell them that he said several insulting things to another kid (\"Your mom is fat,\" \"your writing is stupid,\" etc.) and they said that their son claims he didn't say those things and I'm lying. I'm now receiving texts from this mom twice daily asking for updates on her precious baby and what I'm doing to \"help him feel less fearful in the classroom.\" I'm feeling really discouraged and angry because I put in so much work in the first half of the year to cultivate strong relationships with students and families. Then, one small issue arises, and suddenly I'm considered a liar, a bad teacher, and someone who is out to get their kid. It almost feels as though it would have been easier to not report any issues home and just pretend everything is fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's worse, it would be somewhat manageable if this was one parent, but I have 4-5 parents who are this demanding. I really cannot handle this many parents demanding my time every single day. I've been having to prep for hours at home the past few weeks because all my prep time is taken by parent meetings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: How do I deal with entitled parents who demand frequent contact and updates?",

    "text": "Black eye from student. Hello everyone. I am a 27 year old 2nd year Special Education Para. I work in a small school district with the SPED department being managed by another district. We currently have a female 8 year old 120lb 5 foot tall non-verbal severely autistic student. She has multiple aggressions per day. She loves to pinch, bite, grab and yank our faces, necks, and the rest of our bodies. She uses her body as a bulldozer and she is so forceful. \n\nFor context: Us paras are alone with this student in a room for at least an hour per day per Para. This room unfortunately not only has a hallway door but it also has a fire escape door. \n\nYesterday during my hour and 30 minute time with her this student became extremely aggressive (for no apparent reason) and started pinching, grabbing and biting me. The student then tried to run outside using the fire escape door (which opens directly into our busy parking lot and the student has no comprehension of traffic) I made it to the door right before the student to try and redirect but she then charged me and using her arms or body (unsure, it was all a blur) she slammed my face into a wall. I was finally able to call for backup and we were able to calm her down. \n\nI did not realize the extent of my injury until 20-30 minutes later when I was able to look into a mirror. I had major swelling and redness on my cheekbone where I struck the wall. After an hour I started bruising. After applying ice for 3 hours and working for the last 4 hours of my shift I came home with a completely swollen, black eye. \n\nNo immediate actions were taken upon the child the day of incident or the day after. Today (day after) my principal approached me wanting pictures to send to the superintendent and SPED COOP I work for. Pictures were sent to the mother of the student which she responded with asking if we could put cameras in the room so she can watch us. This request was turned down due to other students being in that room as well as events are able to be misconstrued. \n\nThis is not the first major injury I have sustained from this student, although it is the most severe. \n\nI cannot refuse to work with this student because all of us paras are getting hurt and it’s not fair. We have no proper training whatsoever to compare her aggressions. \n\nI do not want to quit my job because other than this student I love my job. \n\nIf you were in my situation, what would you do? \n\n(Picture of my injuries on my profile if you’re curious)",

    "text": "Venting about a veteran teacher I’m a first year teacher and I would like to preface this by admitting I’ve definitely struggled with classroom management. There is this teacher on my team that I think has lost her mind. She screams at my students when she finds them in the hall, even when they are on calm down walks or Ive instructed them to head somewhere. She will run down the hall to come yell at my students when she hears them being loud(most of the time by the time she gets there, they already quieted down and are back on task). I’ve looked past all of that chalking it up to my inexperience. \n\nWe had field day last Thursday and some of my students were sharing food(a big no at our school). She and I were told and she declared it wasn’t her job to deal with it. I walked over to my students, calmly told them they can’t share food. I was about to deal consequences. She jumps in and starts yelling at them. I tell her I got this and she steps in front of my and continues yelling. \n\nShe comes up to me later and starts telling me about how undeserving my students are and how I WILL cancel my activities and lesson for tomorrow. I had planned to use black lights and let the students do all of our normal work, but with highlighters to help keep them engaged. She says that’s a reward and my students don’t deserve rewards. \n\nWell fast forward to the next day and she has called out sick. All I can say is thank god I don’t have to deal with her drama today. Well I have some of her homeroom students in my math block and they come in saying they have a sub. I brush that off saying I hope she felt better. Her students get excited and tell me she isn’t sick, but it’s a secret. I once again brush them off with a well if it’s a secret then you shouldn’t tell me. The girls blurt out that she told them she was tired of me and my class and our behavior issues. I brush the girls off again because I’m not discussing that with them. I’m obviously livid. I think it was totally inappropriate for her say that to a gaggle of 10 year olds. I know she’s a gossip and I really don’t give a shit what she says to adults but that pissed me off. I’ve emailed the principal and I’m going to talk to him about her. She sticks her nose is my business way to much and I’m tired of her screaming at my students when she doesn’t even know what’s happening. I even got a phone call from a parent about the field day incident demand to know why she was even involved. \n\nOn a positive note, I had a great day when she was out with my students. No behaviors. Everyone on task and working hard. Even my student know for her behavior was completely engaged. I just needed to vent.",

    "text": "Should I take the new job? I hope that this post is allowed. So I am a teacher at an alternate school. I teach all four subjects. The demographic that I teach is mainly black hispanic. I would say about 85% hispanic and 15% black. My students are foster kids, child trafficking victims, drug addicts, parents, etc. even though all my babies have a lot of issues they deal with, I LOVE them and I love being their teacher. They also respect me and tbh I feel like sometimes they look at me like I’m their mom. Well as you could imagine, I live a decent lifestyle. I’m not super rich but with my salary I do ok. I have my own apartment, travel every week, and I’m also in grad school. \nMy co workers and overall the company culture is amazing at my job. When I got surgery and had to take off of work for two weeks, my job paid me the whole time and my students and co workers texted me to make sure I’m ok. My boss is amazing and overall I’m happy where I’m at. (Even though it is a lot of work) \n\nSo I’m currently in grad school. It’s always been my dream to become an art history teacher/ art professor teacher. Or maybe me a manager at an art school. \n\nMy rent is going up and my salary is remaining the same. Last week, I got an offer to work as an art history teacher and the salary is about $30k more. \n\nThis is the salary I would like and it’s in a field that I want to work in. It also aligns with what I’m studying in grad school. Even though I’m NOT struggling with my salary, more money is always nice. \n\nHere’s the problem. I’m SO conflicted at leaving my current school. My co workers and company culture is amazing. I’m genuinely happy here. Also, I KNOW that my job won’t be able to find another teacher as good as me. (I say this humbly). My students trust me and I know that they look up for me. I feel guilty and conflicted for leaving. Im scared that if I leave, they won’t be able to excel at life. \n\nSince I started teaching them, over 60% of my students graduated early and are now in college. This is also the first year where any of the students at the school have decided to go to college. \n\nI’m good at what I do…and I love teaching. \n\nBut anyway, my bf thinks I should take the job.

    "text": "Get help if this is you (Apologies, it's a bit of a long post)\n\nFor the first nine years of my career in education, I burned myself out every single year. Every year it just got worse and worse, and I knew I could expect a nervous breakdown every year; especially in the third term (the worst term for final year high school students). The pile of marking kept getting the best of me, I just couldn't manage to get everything done on time and to a satisfactory standard. Because I was clearly not coping, I’ve been looking for an opportunity to change careers.\n\nLast December I checked into a mental health clinic and started my mental health journey. I was finally diagnosed with ADHD and OCPD (an awful combination) at the age of 36. At last I got help. It wasn't an easy journey; it took four tries to get a medication that worked with three different therapists!\n\nThe drastic improvement it's brought about in my life, especially with regards to marking, cannot be overstated. It's as if I finally have a say in what my brain and body needs to do, now I’m not being led around seeing all things bright, shiny and interesting. Before, I was unable to mark unless I got into some magical hyperfocus state (now I know the name for it), which I only managed to get into LATE at night. Consequently, I was never able to mark during the week. It was a disaster; I would try, but I just couldn't focus enough to get going. I kept getting sidetracked with new and interesting projects or tasks. Procrastivity (productivity as a form of procrastination) is a real thing! For the first time in years, I am able to decide when and where to work, and the stream of thoughts popping into my head, are finally quiet. My ability to prioritise has also drastically improved.\n\nOCPD is a compulsive personality type where one is ruled by an absolute dread at ever making a mistake, and a steadfast belief that you are the only one doing it right, everyone else simply has an awfully poor work ethic. Getting a better understanding of that, has also made an enormous difference in my marking speed. Now everything doesn't have to be black or white, I am finally comfortable with a bit of grey. I am so sorry for the criticism and pride I have displayed towards others all these years, when I have been the one with a problem.\n\nI am so thankful for the journey God has taken me on. Character development isn't a pleasant process, and waiting so long to get the right help has been a nightmare. If He didn't carry me through these past years, I would probably not be here anymore. Thankfully, through countless divine appointments, conversations, closed doors and other open ones, I now have an answer, and I'm in a completely different place in my life. \n\nFor the first time (in my 10th year of being a teacher) I have managed to finish my marking on time, and I will have my first ever mid-year school holiday. \n\nIf anything in this post has resonated with you, know that you are not alone. You are not the only one not coping, you do not need to be ashamed. Get help, it is out there!",

    "text": "Black Teachers, How Do You Connect with Your Black Students? [22F] I'm a recent grad and I just got my first job teaching at this summer program. I'm super stoked to be teaching English, litcrit and storytelling to mostly black middle schoolers in NYC. I've taught this age group and subject matter before in a volunteering context and I'm looking forward to empowering these kids thru reading and writing as some of my favorite English teachers have done for me. However, I'm unsure if I will be effective.\n\nI'm afraid that I won't be able to connect with these kids. A lot of this stems from insecurities i have about being \"black enough\". I grew up in the mostly black suburbs of Philly, ive attended Catholic schools with varying levels of white kids and my family is solidly middle class Afro Carribbean. Many of these kids have lived in the projects, experience issues w food insecurity, homelessness, sexual abuse and police violence/incarceration. I'm not saying this to be a savior or look down on them, as I understand they cant help the structural issues that created their environment. However, I acknowledge even if we share skin color - black narratives are not a monolith. What's more, I'm generally very quiet and I don't like conflict, so I'm unsure how to do classroom management without seeming like a tyrant or a pushover, especially since rules for conduct are generally more lax in public school.\n\nI'm very committed to combatting anti blackness in schools and understand the importance of black educators as a way to inspire young people. However, I feel scared that the kids may see me as uppity, an Oreo or otherwise out of touch.",

    "text": "Why the Department of Defense’s schools are outperforming the competition [https://thehill.com/opinion/education/3719861-why-the-department-of-defenses-schools-are-outperforming-the-competition/](https://thehill.com/opinion/education/3719861-why-the-department-of-defenses-schools-are-outperforming-the-competition/) \n\nIn the first major national assessment of K-12 students since the height of the pandemic, schools dedicated to educating U.S. military-connected children have outperformed most school systems across the nation, despite the impact of the pandemic.  \nJust-released results from the 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress tests show that fourth- and eighth-grade students attending Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools led the nation in scoring on reading and mathematics assessments.  \n“DoDEA students’ average scale scores ranged from 15 to 23 points higher than all corresponding national average scores and held steady or increased while all national average scores decreased,” the Department of Defense said in a statement.  \nDoDEA was the only U.S. state or jurisdiction taking the tests to see a score increase for any grade or subject on the first NAEP test administered since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nThe scores also show progress for Black and Hispanic students in the DoDEA system. DoDEA’s “emphasis on equity in education is reflected in higher scores across their diverse population and achievement gaps that are significantly smaller than the rest of the nation,” said Gilbert Cisneros, undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness. “I am particularly pleased to see those efforts reflected in Black and Hispanic student groups that are outperforming the nation overall,” he added.  \nThe Department of Defense Education Activity is a federally operated school system that provides pre-kindergarten through grade 12 education for the children of military service members and Department of Defense civilian employees. In 2021, DoDEA operated 160 schools in three regions — U.S. installations in the Americas, Europe and the Pacific.  \nThe success of DoDEA schools is an amazing feat, especially given that military-connected children lead highly disrupted lives. They change schools every two to three years with a parent on active duty. And with a parent (or parents) sometimes deployed doing dangerous work, the children face stressors others do not as they manage schoolwork, home responsibilities and regular transitions in and out of communities.\n\nI wrote earlier this year about the success of DoDEA schools in mitigating the pandemic. The recent NAEP scores underscore that their approach to managing students with highly disrupted K-12 careers can provide insights for weathering something as damaging to student learning as a pandemic.  \nDoDEA Director Thomas Brady told me that a turning point for the school system came in 2016 when they began implementing college- and career-ready standards starting with mathematics. Also, it made a big investment in teacher and leader development that has continued over the last nine years.  \n“Our commitment to student achievement and to teacher training and development all combined for positive development in the classroom,” he said.  \nJeffrey Noel, DoDEA’s chief of educational research, told me that some of the success can be attributed to an overriding philosophy that guides the use of resources. DoDEA schools focus on limiting excessive bureaucracy — a big problem for many school districts — and instead prioritize efforts that can have the most impact on students.  \nOne was a push for in-person instruction. DoDEA schools shifted to remote learning during early 2020 like most other public school districts. But only months later, by the beginning of the school year in September 2020, DoDEA focused on in-person learning with mitigation measures as many school districts were unable to reopen. By March 2021, 99 percent of DoDEA schools were operating in person and 100 percent by this past fall.  \nMilitary-connected kids who attend DoDEA schools are not the typical public school cohort. They have parents with jobs, health care, food and housing; their schools are well-funded and don’t have the same federally imposed requirements. They also operate in a unique system of a shared culture and familiarity between students, parents, teachers, school faculty and base leaders. But they don’t have it easy.   \nDoDEA schools are succeeding — and that merits a closer look for lessons that can help school systems struggling to gain back learning losses.\n\n&#x200B;",

I am not complaining, but how reliable is the educational research I see in actual education journals?   \n\nAt the local level it just seems like it is either cherry picked without adequate context/background or more recently greatly diminished in to service equity initiatives.\n\nI argued in a course (very awkwardly) that I just don't trust a lot of educational data and educational research.  It also seems like book studies on structural racism such as Kendy's 'How to Raise an Anti-Racist' has supplanted actual educational research in importance.  I am not complaining about the content, just how it has replaced actual educational research.\n\nReferral data and expulsion data can managed in ways to slow the process down or disincentivize teachers/admin from even starting any processes.   In my experience, it used to take a long time to expel a kid unless hard drugs or weapons were involved, usually at least 25 referrals and at least a year of documented interventions.\n\nI then made the comment that I felt that some students of color were not being put in the programs they need because of optics.     At this point I made some people very uncomfortable as this was a graduate course on multicultural education, so I wasn't exactly repeating the usual education tropes.\n\nI mentioned the Coleman study to the instructor, and she had never even heard of it.

    "text": "Disrespectful parent Having my first shower cry of the year. My school has uniforms and yesterday at PD we were told that we needed to be cracking down because they are noticing a lot of kids out of uniform. One of the rules is that they can only wear school hoodies/jackets. We're in Texas so it just started getting cold, and yesterday one of my students came in wearing a non-school hoodie. I told him he had to take it off and to bring his school hoodie tomorrow, and he complied. This morning, he came in wearing the same hoodie and I told him 3 times to take it off, and he ignored me the first two times then on the last time told me his mom said to talk to her about it. I immediately messaged Mom and asked what the issue is. She told me that he has always been allowed to wear that hoodie because the school doesn't make them in his size (5XL tall), and I told her that no one had informed me of this but I would check with admin. Admin told me that he is allowed to wear a PLAIN black or dark blue hoodie. The hoodie he was wearing had a graphic on the front, so I relayed this information to mom. Mom told me he's been wearing the same hoodie for 4 years and I'm the first one that's said anything about it, and that she cannot afford to get him a new hoodie right now and told me to have admin call her, and that I should be only worried about his grade. I again told her that is not what I was told by admin and that part of my job is making sure students are following the code of conduct, which includes uniform. I asked her what size her son wore so I could get him a plain hoodie, because it's not his fault the school doesn't accommodate his size. She told me but also added that they run \"about $95.\" I was very confused by this because I found one on Amazon for $35. I told her I would see what I could find. It's not the first time I have bought clothes for a student who needed them, I shouldn't have to but that's the world we live in and I became a teacher so I could help kids.\n\nShe then sent me a long message saying that I clearly don't care about my students' grades and the reason he doesn't have an A in my class is obviously because I care more about uniforms. (He got an 84% in Q1. I teach AP world history and all 10th graders are required to take my class. That's a great grade especially considering he has a learning disability. Mom also told me at the beginning of the year his goal is all As and Bs, not straight As.) Personally, I don't care for school uniforms but rules are rules. I'm not making exceptions because these kids will take anything they can to claim I'm treating them unfairly. It also shows my students that I am serious when it comes to the rules and they know exactly what to expect from me, I don't let them get away with even the smallest thing because I know if I give them an inch they will take it a mile. Many of my students have come back to me and said that even though it was frustrating they're glad I held them accountable because it made them more mature and responsible. But then this mom accused me of essentially not caring about any of my students' education and that I'm being unfair to her child and then sarcastically said that she'll do whatever she needs to to \"make you happy\" and that she's going to \"take this up with headquarters.\" The conversation was over text, so I was able to stay calm and professional, but at that point I just told her thank you for advocating for your son and I will get this all figured out. I then sent our conversation to my manager and told her to deal with it.\n\nI work my ass off for these kids. I'm not a parent, so I see my students as my kids. I would do anything for them if I could, I would have given her kid the clothes off my own back if they would fit him. I work 60-80 hour weeks for garbage pay, I lose sleep worrying about the health and safety off my kids because baby of them are high risk populations. I know I'm an amazing teacher, and I try to remember the students and parents that see that and appreciate it, but there always has to be that parent that thinks I'm the devil because I don't think their kid is the perfect angel who never does anything wrong, and then imply they're going to try to get me fired (even though I know there's not a chance in hell). I love teaching, but it's bullshit like that that makes it harder and harder to want to stay.\n\nNo advice needed, just needed to rant.",

    "text": "When are you supposed to call admin? New teacher here, literally started in December teaching 3rd grade. \n\nI’ve always struggled with this, I wish it was really black and white as to when I need to call admin. I worked in childcare for 5.5 years, and for 5.5 years I dealt with ATROCIOUS behavior and absolutely no support from management (if management was even in the building). I’ve also nannied for years and for years I’ve been physically harmed by children, observed massive tantrums and seen kids do some wild ass shit. I may be a new teacher, but I’ve got my fair share of behavior experience, and I know how to deal with it. \n\nI worry though, that I should be letting administration know when things like physical alterations or extreme meltdowns happen in the classroom. I had a kid push another kid down today. I deescalated, talked with both kids, apologies were had and no one was hurt, but should I have told someone? I do NOT want to over call or have administration think I’m the “weak” new teacher because I’m telling them about things, but I don’t want to get in over my head and then be told “why on earth didn’t you tell us?”. So, what’s the deal here? When do you guys report to admin and what for? \n\n* My administration is insanely supportive and pro-teacher (yayy!) because I do know that makes a difference.",

    "text": "Recommended Reading for MAT Student? Hello!\n\nI'm in a MAT program and will complete student teaching (if all goes according to plan) next spring. My goal is to teach in my city, which is one of the biggest and most segregated cities in the US. I'm a biracial black woman, so I have some advantages over the typical white female teacher I usually see in my city when it comes to engaging with diverse students, but I also grew up in a middle-income family and went to primarily well-funded, suburban public schools.  \n\nI've been following this subreddit since last year, and someone here recommended a book, \"Grading for Equity\" by Joe Feldman, which I listened to on audible while working and commuting. I've found it really helpful in rethinking my approach and how I want to begin my career in the classroom. I am 33 and pretty tough, but I also like the philosophy of the book in not becoming the type of teacher who wants to control their students behavior by using grades as a weapon. I know that's a controversial stance to take. Still, I think the book makes a good argument for why grades shouldn't reflect student behavior and how taking that approach can lead to issues like cultural bias against minority students and classroom management issues. \n\nAnyway, I really liked this book's approach. I would love to hear anyone's feelings about it if they have tried implementing these techniques before after reading the book or if they have any recommendations for other books similar to \"Grading for Equity.\" My focus on equity is really from a socio-economic lens since that's what I think will come as a challenge for me due to my background. \n\nI've been reading stuff from my Education classes but outside of two books I read for my Teaching of History class, most readings have been philosophical rather than practical.",

    "text": "Co workers are not your friends \n\n\nA couple months ago, I made friends with two of my co workers. Long story short we made a group chat where we would sometimes rant about work or we would call each other. I said something about management and a few weeks ago I told management what I said before someone else said it and my manager told me to handle the situation or I could potentially get fired. So I told the girls if we could delete the group chat. Which they both agreed to do, or so I thought.\n\nFast forward to two weeks later, I was getting a lot of push back from one of the girls when I was delegating a task to her. Mind you, I’m a position above her and it’s a part of my role and I guess she didn’t like that. She knows I would like to potentially move up in the company as well. \n\nWell on my day off I guess she showed a manager who was not involved, our group chat that we had made because she kept it and that manger took screenshots of it and sent it to another manager to basically black mail me or make it seem like she has something on me when clearly she also talked a lot of shit in that group chat as well. But I deleted this group chat weeks ago and now the managers want to talk to me about it today and I’m just so over it and I know I was in the wrong for even involving myself in the situation. I’m just embarrassed by the whole thing. I don’t want to lose my job.",

    "text": "The Fairmont's Jasper Park Lodge Corporate Manslaughter This is a true story that exposes a skeleton in the closet of an extremely wealthy business. And how I caused the vice president of the Fairmont’s Jasper Park Lodge to resign. \n\n(Please watch the Video for picture evidence)\n\nSo I took a job to work for a mega wealthy multi billion dollar company that literally caters to royalty and A list celebrities. I initially thought this was going to be an amazing opportunity to start my life over fresh. I was going to make some new friends, learn some new skills, and finish the practical half of my power engineer course. At first glance, the face of this company looked absolutely beautiful. But it wasn’t until I got there that I learned the ugly truth about how they operate and managed to accumulate this massive wealth. \n\nOn my first day working at this place I was put through orientation. During this time the presenter boasted about how they just received a “10 million dollar luxury budget” to be spent on their most expensive cabins. I thought to myself wow this place really will spare no expense when it comes to upgrading their facilities. After the orientation was finished I went to check into my room in the employee living area as this business operates in a national park which is somewhat remote. \n\nAs I approached my designated cabin I immediately noticed what poor condition it was in. The first thing I noticed was the stairs that led up to the cabin were completely rotted and there was a step missing from the set of stairs. I avoided the hazard the best I could and made it to my assigned room. When I entered my domicile my jaw hit the floor. The room was covered in black mold as if the room had not been cleaned in several years. I had actually gotten strep throat from sleeping in a room that had a patch of black mold and this place was 10 times worse. \n\nObviously annoyed, I went to call a friend I had made early in the day to see how I should handle this. But my phone was dead so I pulled my charger from the bag and went to plug it in the wall. As soon as I inserted the charger and released my hand the charging block fell to the floor immediately.  The electrical contacts in the wall outlet were so loose I couldn’t even charge my phone. (For those who don’t know that is a serious fire hazard as the gap between electrical contacts can ark out and start a fire from inside the wall). There were only a couple outlets in the room and neither were functional. \n\nEven more annoyed, I walked over to my new buddy’s room to use his wall outlet and tell him about the conditions of the room I was put in. This was the start of the rabbit hole I fell head first into. After ranting for a couple minutes to my buddy about the room, he informed me that the company hasn’t put a penny into maintaining their employee housing area in years since they previously hired foreign workers and they would never complain about their living conditions for obvious reasons. \n\nI was shocked hearing this, given the stark contrast of the customer facing side of the business and what they offer their employees. But… it gets worse. He goes on to tell me that an employee actually died falling down stairs that didn’t have handrails and weren’t maintained 4 years ago. I asked him to show me where it happened and he took me outside and pointed to a building called “le pub”.\n\nI walk over to le pub and a few moments later my mood changed from annoyed to fking pissed! Standing on the stairs leading to le pub I could tell that they were pretty much in the same condition as the cabin they moved me into. I thought to myself “how can these stairs owned by a multi billion dollar company be in such a horrible condition after they were directly related to a death of a colleague?” \n\nNow, a little background about myself. Before my switch to power engineering I was a journeyman welder/fitter, so I understand building codes, as I have built more than a few set of stairs over my career. There have been multiple studies showing that if stairs are off by more than 1/8th, it drastically increases the chances of someone tripping and fall. With that in mind, can you guess how poor of condition these steps were in? \n\n1 and 1/4 inch. Yeah – that’s 10 times more that is permitted in building codes.\n\nAfter coming to the realization that I had just taken residency is a literal death trap, I expanded my gaze and went for a stroll around the property. And oh boy what I found should make any reasonable person disgusted. For contrast, here is an example of a hazard on the customer facing side of the business that proves they are fully aware of how to control and mitigate a hazard that could potentially cause harm. \n\nNow here is a barrage of uncontrolled hazards in the back end of their billion dollar business.  \n\nNow armed with extensive documentation of blatant gross negligence on be half of the company, I was now ready to speak with the people charged with managing this train wreck. \n\nThe four main managers I dealt with are Ken  (President of JPL), Eric (VP of JPL), Wayne  (Engineering Director at JPL), and Heather (CEO of Accor Hotels). Wayne has an interesting background as he worked his way up from being a dishwasher to being the director of engineering without any formal education to my knowledge. I had multiple conversations with these managers and I started recording them when I started catching them in lies. When I called these men out, they seemed somewhat reasonable at first, saying that everything would be taken care of. I ask them when they planned on getting the work done and they told me that it will be a project for next year. \n\nI told them that’s unacceptable and they need to start on the repairs yesterday. They said things don’t happen that quickly and things like this take time. I told them they’ve had over 4 years to fix the steps that took their employees life. Don’t you think that’s more than enough time to fix a serious hazard? And what would happen if someone else got hurt in the time that they’re putting off these repairs?\n\nEric gave me an answer that left me completely flabbergasted. He said and I quote “if someone gets hurt then that’s just something that happens.” I was honestly shook when I heard those words slip from his mouth. He then told me that trades people don’t work in winter. Mind you this conversation occurred in October. I told him that’s not true and if they can’t find anyone to do the work that I would be willing to do it. He refused my offer and said my priority is to make sure the customers are satisfied.  \n\nWayne told me that “if I wasn’t happy with the situation I should quit.” So, I came to the conclusion that these managers did not care about the welfare of their employees. It turned out they wanted to delay these urgent repairs so that they could slip decades worth of neglect into their current budget, so that they wouldn’t have to ask their higher ups for additional funding. This in my opinion was a whole new level of gross negligence. The only option was to go over their heads. I came to the realization that I couldn’t work under these callous managers and I took Wayne’s advice and quit. \n\nAfter their higher ups were informed of the state of the property and how Eric handled the situation, he knew his career with the company was over and resigned a few months later. After I quit my job, I contacted the Fairmont’s parent company and spoke with one of their executives. She appeared sympathetic and assured me that these issues would be taken care of and I would receive updates on their progress. My confrontation occurred 6 years ago and I haven’t received any updates as of this post. \n\nSoon after I quit, I was contacted by Ken Hall, the president of the Fairmont’s jasper park lodge, pleading with me to lie to Employment insurance about why I was forced to quit this job. He asked if I could tell them that I was moving to assist with a family emergency, since I would have to report my findings to occupational health and safety. I ignored this request to lie and reported the truth. They were given multiple violation notices (and my application for EI was granted).\n\nI left out quite a few details for the sake of time. if this story gains any traction I will post updates including my conversation with the police that results in one officer admitting to neglect of duty in the case. I’m also in contact with the family of the victim and can fill you all in from their perspective. \n\nIn your opinion, does it sound like the administration of Fairmont’s jasper park lodge got away with corporate manslaughter? Or is the preventable death of an employee just something that happens?",

    "text": "Write Down Everything I Do During The Work? Okay Boss!! So there I was at my maintenance job, fixing things and preparing vacant apartments. We were told day 1 that we need to write down what we do, but it doesn't have to be too detailed.  For example, if I fix a sink cartridge in apartment A000, on payroll I write down 9:00 - 10:00, fixed sink cartridge in A000. Replaced.\n\nSounds pretty simple and easy to understand, right?\n\nWell, I got assigned the objectively worst property to work on. Highest crime rate, pipes that are constantly breaking; I spent about 40 hours just organizing and sorting the shop when I got on site.\n\nThe big boss, to say he did nothing is a compliment, actively hurt our job and reputation, the details and such are a whole story for another time. One day, he decided that we were not working hard enough. This is because the hardest property was not filling empty apartments fast enough. So he told the entire maintenance team that we need to write down in more detail everything we do because \"if we were working 8 hours a day legitimately, we would have no vacant units.\" Mind you, we were also working on 2 other properties at the exact same time, and they were as full as possible. Things were already boiling, so we also decided it was quitting time at this point. \n\nNormally, my payroll was 1-2 pages long. However, I decided why not give him what he wants?\n\nMy last payroll entry was 28 pages long. Mind you, I was so done Friday I just wrote a couple of paragraphs about why I was leaving, so I could have made it longer. On average, 3 hours a day were spent filling out all these notes. I also made sure to include slight changes in how I wrote stuff, so that the big boss 100% knew I was doing exactly what I was saying.\n\nDid I also mention, they only let me work 6 hours a day? lol\n\nNow, I present to you some of my favorite sections :) For privacy, I am going to refer all apartment numbers as \"A000.\" We needed to mark which property we are at at some points, so those will be referred to as \"WORK,\" as well, I changed some words and names for privacy.

It’s finally passable\n\n12:55 Took off right glove\n\n12:55 - 12:56 Took off left glove\n\n12:56 - 12:58 Left A000\n\n12:58 - 12:59 Was walking back to the shop, but I saw an epic looking cloud, and I just had to take a picture of it.

Their manager has been quite forthcoming with informing them that they need to start seeking other employment because their bi-weekly co-parenting duties are causing too much interference with their full time work life.\n\nTo the best of my ability, I have advocated to my friend to get any and all interactions with this manager in writing or email, and to not sign a thing until the proper precautions have been taken or speaking with our labor board.\n\n\nProblem is, this manager is clearly beating around the bush and waiting for my friend to make their own quit date to avoid dishing out any unemployment. When my friend has asked their manager if they were being laid off or fired the answer has always been along the lines of “aren’t those the same thing?”, and then brushed off with “maybe you could be done at the end of August?”.\n\nMy friend is feeling straight hazed y’all, and the manager is avoiding giving them any written documentation in association with this looming black cloud. My friend is somewhat of a pacifist, and I’d like to help them without causing a ruckus in their personal life.\n\nThoughts?

    "text": "How to become a product manager? Advice I want to tell you about the path of becoming a product manager (PM) and the vision of this profession. It is not the only true one, but it will definitely broaden your horizons. The article is most suitable for students and graduates with minimal work experience.\n\n# The base\n\nA product manager is not about knowledge of IT terms and the use of existing tools. Knowledge of the agile manifesto will undoubtedly help you on the way, but will not make you a product manager. That's why I don't recommend starting with books that directly write about product management (inspired, the lean startup, hooked). I believe that in order to approach such books, you need to initially have a base for discussion. Otherwise, you will not be able to reach your potential as a PM, while reading them. Each product experience is unique and depends on the situation and time.\n\nTo begin with, I recommend reading books that gonna help you understand the philosophy of proper management and product approach:\n\n1. Kaizen: The Key To Japan's Competitive Success. The book is about Japanese philosophy, thanks to which the concepts of kanban and lean were born. This philosophy can be put not only in the foundation of the agile, but also in the foundation of your own life path.\n2. Writing That Works; How to Communicate Effectively In Business. As a product manager, you will connect different parts of the business and constantly communicate. It is necessary to properly structure and convey your thoughts to the interlocutor.\n3. High Output Management. This book describes the basic product approach to doing business. You will learn how to conceptually understand the product, thanks to the “black box” principle.\n4. The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement. To build clear processes and avoid bottlenecks.\n5. Blue Ocean Strategy. Real examples of product development analysis in different business area and a clear explanation about competition principles\n\n# Explore the pain\n\n1) Get a job as a manager. The vacancy “sales manager” / “customer service manager” is perfect for starting:\n\n* In most cases, it does not require work experience\n* Learn how to sell yourself and your product ideas\n* Ability to identify customer pains\n* Improving communication skills\n* Finding optimal ways to solve the problem\n* Working with documentation and its creation\n\nIdeally, you need to get a job in a company that is connected with the IT industry. This will ease the way and give you the opportunity to grow as a PM within the company. You will know the audience and their pain perfectly and will be able to improve the company's existing products without any problems.\n\n2) Make your own business. A more complex, but at the same time a more profitable way for getting knowledge. It is not necessary to create a complex business with large risks and investments. You can buy socks in China and resell them on the local marketplace - this is also a business. Everything that you will do while creating a business will be relevant to your future profession.\n\n# Google it\n\nTo understand the development processes, you have to take an ordinary product and decompose it. The easiest way to do this is, to take the google.com search, but you can choose any other popular product (instagram, telegram, reddit). You need to understand what is happening inside the product: before, during and after using it.  \nTry to answer the following questions:\n\nHow this product works technically\n\nHow the design of this product works\n\nHow this product makes money\n\nYou need to focus on those keywords:\n\n* Technical:\n   * Frontend\n   * Backend\n   * API\n   * DataBase\n   * Programming language\n   * Server\n   * Analytics\n   * Platform (desktop, mobile)\n* Design:\n   * User experience (ux)\n   * User interface (ui)\n* Money:\n   * Advertisement\n   * Subscription\n\nThis is the end of part 1, thanks for your attention and i hope you learned something new. I would like to discuss this with you and have some feedback.\n\nNext time, i want to write about:\n\nIn Part 2:\n\n* about the terminology of product management\n* the stages of the appearance of the feature from idea to implementation\n* what is technical specification\n\nIn Part 3:\n\n* metrics and experiments\n* preparation for the interview",

    "text": "I'm a (copy)writer afraid of my future, what do you recommend? TL;Dr: I'm looking for advice of what new skills/certificates/paths I can consider as someone who's good at writing, content creation, and managing a small group of people but absolutely suck at math and analytical tasks.\n\n\n\nHello! Currently, I'm working as a SEO Copywriter and Content Creator, and a big part of my role is also coordinating external employees aka freelancers. I also used to work as a journalist and made a few interviews with young entrepreneurs from the tech industry and how their start ups can change the world for better (honestly I loved this job, but it was more like a freelancer and I didn't have time to continue with that). Besides this, I'm about publish my first novel and, hopefully, not the last one :)\n\nWith that being said, I'm worried about my future in the field of copywriter (in my native language, not English). Chatgpt and/or other AI will be able replace copywriters soon and I'm looking for something else I can learn, even to have as a \"backup\" plan. Just to make it clear, I'm a copywriter who writes product descriptions according to SEO and articles regarding specific niche, so it's not the type of easy content that can be generated with one click (like: \"When does black Friday start 2024\" can be written by the AI as it doesn't require any creativity). Still, better safe than sorry and I simply want to learn something new that could help me in the future in case my job is not much needed anymore. :)\n\nSadly, I'm not as smart as I would like to. Sure, I can be creative, but I suck at math and everything analytical. Therefore, all the jobs that seem like such a good idea, are not the best fit for me. As much as I would love to be a data analyst, developer or an engineer who will design a sonda that will go to damn Mars, I can't. Don't get me wrong, I love learning new stuff! Reddit is a great source of knowledge and also somewhat of \"brain excersise\" as so many people here are smart and have a lot of knowledge! So yeah, I like learning but... I usually don't remember the process, just the conclusion. To give you an example: at some point in my life I read a lot about certain disease. It's quite rare, yet I know how it looks like, what are the stages of the disease, how many people have etc. but i simply don't understand the process when it comes to the genetics. I know the conclusion, but it's not enough. I think it's due to the diagnosis of ADHD, and I'm planning to try some exercises that help with logical thinking, analytical skills etc. (I don't even know if it makes sense in English lol), but I don't think I can change my brain completely to become, let's say a developer and be good at it.\n\n\nSo, to sum up: do you have any advice of what skills can I get that would be beneficial? Career paths that I can consider? Something not too analytical, if possible... What I can do now and what I think I'm good at (in a nutshell):\n*Copywriting\n*Creative Writing\n*Fiction writing and storytelling \n*SEO knowledge\n*Knowledge of how to do the key word research and optimize the text according to the SEO and data from Google Search Console or Semrush\n*Basic knowledge on design in Figma\n*Journalism\n*Content Creation (blog articles about both\n specific, niche topics and \"evergreen content\", interviews, creating content for the pmax videos and Google campgains)\n*Taking responsibility of a group of external employees, which includes: sending briefings to them, offboarding and on-boarding, checking the contracts and the invoices (if everything matches),  analysing and optimizing pages in different langues, basically being the only person of contact \nSoft skills: Quite a people person (sadly haha), not afraid of public speaking or presenting stuff, a brain that is more like a popcorn machine so I can have many ideas, I'm also quite open-minded and eager to change things for better rather than sit still.\n\nWhat I'm not good at: Like I said before, numbers, analysis, too much data are not for me. It sucks but well, it is how it is :) If any of you have any suggestions or tips, I would very much appreciate it! Thanks in advance! :)",

    "text": "Urgently Need Help: Battling ADHD Struggles in Engineering, any advice? \n\nHey Reddit,\n\nThis is a throwaway. I want to share my wild ride through engineering with ADHD. Since 4th grade, I've been dreaming of being an engineer – inspired by Myth Busters and Lego robotics. It's the ONLY thing I've wanted to be for as long as I remember. High school was a success, but my struggle to focus on all classes led me to Adderall. It helped me excel, secure a full ride to college, and even ace AP classes.\n\nIn college, though, the rollercoaster began. Engineering's complexities made me feel like I was battling a strong current. Adderall became my lifeline, but it came at a cost – insomnia and dependency. Late nights in the lab became the norm as I wrestled ADHD's impact on my studies.\n\nNavigating isolation as the only black man in the program was tough. But connecting with classmates facing similar challenges created a lifeline. Study groups became my refuge where I could openly share my struggles.\n\nA game-changing moment was our capstone project – designing an unmanned aircraft system. I poured my hyperfocus into the project, adapting strategies to manage my time and focus better. The validation and excitement I felt when we presented it were unlike anything else.\n\nWhile I didn't graduate right away due to heavy workload, I found a data science internship, worked a few jobs, and tutored computer science part-time. Unfortunately, the full-time job didn't stick, and now I'm unemployed, feeling like a failure. The FE exam proved tough, and finding a job in my field seems impossible. I'm feeling like my hard work was for nothing and I'm not cut out for this engineering shit.\n\nSo, fellow Redditors, if you've faced similar situations, I'd love to hear your advice.\n\nTL;DR: Struggled with ADHD and isolation in engineering as a black man. Found support from peers and adapted strategies. Succeeded in capstone, graduated, worked but currently unemployed. Seeking advice to overcome challenges and find direction.",

    "text": "I feel like all of my current and former peers are passing me by at 100mph and I’m stuck spinning my tires in situations I hate with no way of changing them. How do I turn it around? \nTl;dr I need to escape a dead end job and subpar educational background and actually become something but I feel like even though I have the drive to change it, I don’t know where to start, don’t know if I have the resources to do so at all. \n\nKind of a rant. Idk. \n\nI graduated from college a year and two months ago with a degree in history and English. Since then I have held two jobs: I managed a coffee shop, which was fun but unsustainable, and I worked at a hotel which is my current job. Well paying, but not enjoyable tbh. \n\nMy grades weren’t amazing when I graduated because I had been struggling with pretty substantial major depression and suicidal ideation for the second half of college that happened during Covid. Still, “c’s get degrees” and all that so I powered through. History and English are really my main two interests aside from more niche subtopics like anthropology, studies of myth & religion, archaeology, etc. but I just knew that I didn’t want to do something that wouldn’t play to a passion of mine. I want to love my work even if it means sacrificing financial stability now. \n\nI now have neither. \n\nI regret my degrees and wish, as someone who didn’t aim for the focus of being a teacher or some shit that I had specialized my focus to anthropology or archaeology more closely but I’m insanely broke and can’t even fathom going back to school to pick up the pieces and get another degree, even fast-tracked or online (I also just don’t think it would look good). I also told myself I wasn’t interested in grad school in the past and that I would worry about it in the future if I wanted but I needed a break. That was a mistake. The opportunity for some sort of internship came and went forever. I never corresponded closely enough with professors to get a leg up in that regard. And again, I got so-so grades for useless degrees and I have not been proven to have had any more worth than someone who just straight up didn’t go to college. I wasted four years for a lifetime of shame and regret and crippling debt. My current partner also says that I can’t go to grad school unless I can get funding because it would leave us too deep in debt so it’s seemingly off the table, but tot doesn’t even look like people in my field are making decent splashes with their careers anyways unless they have doctorates which like, as if. \n\nMeanwhile, my two close friends got degrees in business and communications and are working comfortable high-paying jobs. They’re both 23 and just bought their first house. My older sister just moved to Chicago for grad school after an absolutely incredible i story of internships, opportunities, and points of excellence as a student and my younger sister had an internship with a law firm as an undergrad with law school aspirations. Even my friend who dropped out of college and is a full-blown alcoholic is working an extremely successful career as a mechanic. And I’m here, working in hospitality for barely enough money to scrape by with a partner who isn’t doing much better in a role that I probably only needed a GED to get in a city I didn’t really want to live in. I feel like a failure. \n\nEveryone says I’m smart. Everyone has said I’m smart my whole life. I don’t feel smart. I feel inept at everything I do. I struggled through high school. I struggled in college. I like the things that I mentioned. I live for books and literature and sagas of history and the world of man, and want to spend a lifetime studying humanity and sharing my findings with humanity. I wanted to be a professor but I can wave that goodbye without good grades, grad school, or any real achievements to stand on. I’m even writing a book, as author is another big achievement that I would love to reach, but I’m 30,000 words/100 pages deep into writing it and just feel defeated. I doubt myself at every turn and I feel like finishing a story that people will care about as much as I do and actually conquering the task of traditional publication is such a Herculean task that it feels impossible. I write regardless, but it doesn’t hold the same luster. I can’t even get a job working the door of a museum with how bad the job market is rn, and neither can people I know that DO have master’s degrees. \n\nI even decided at one point that I would be content with working in a coffee shop my whole life. Why not? It was fun. I was good at it. I made people happy and worked in an environment that didn’t make me wish I was dead. Making flat whites doesn’t keep food on the table though. I even got a job offer from a coffee shop that I would consider dream job territory and when I asked if their wage of $11/hr was negotiable as I couldn’t survive off of that, they cut contact with me. \n\nI moved to a different city because I thought that that would change things. Cities are where opportunities are, right? It’s no different. \n\nI’m 22 years old. 23 in a month. I feel like every action I’ve taken in my life thus far has been failure after failure leading me to the failure that I am now, and I’m just stuck job hopping in industries that I hate forever until I get my big break too late for me to be able to smother out the regret of lost opportunities with money or I die.\n\nI don’t sleep anymore. I eat enough to stay mostly alive. I stopped going to the gym, which was my one great non-intellectual hobby that brought me joy. I just want to succeed.

    "text": "Should take the leap and I quit my job?! \nI 20F, have been working for a mortgage broking/investment acquisition company for about 18 months now. When I first began, it was super full on, 12-15 hour work days 6 days a week plus doing lead generation on Sunday’s so essentially 364 work days a year. My role was assisting the company in acquiring new clients and attracting those clients to working with the company. This role is meant to be short term and you are to then move into other areas of the company. I have been the black sheep of the company for a long time as I moved into an administration role as opposed to a sales role as the long days are not for me; nor are the crippling KPI’s. I find the work that I’m doing now relatively enjoyable, I work 9-5 very minimal OT required. Salary of $45k p.a. AUD with decent bonuses, should be minimum $10k p.a. but I find returning to work after time off causes me crippling anxiety. \n\nThere is one particular member of the leadership team that has been quite cruel to me. Giving me a dressing down with the door open so the whole office can hear. on one occasion over shit she had blown out of proportion - being 2 minutes late to a meeting, when i had asked my manager if i could duck to the bathroom before the meeting as i hadn’t had a chance prior due to training, this leadership member lost her mind at me as i had filled up my glass on the way to the meeting room…. i copped a 10 minute lecture from her for this) \n\nAside from her, most of my colleagues are good ranging from tolerable to nice. \nDuring my time with the company, i have had a short break over christmas 21, an illness march 22 (my position was threatened while I was away due to a horrific ovarian cyst - I had 2 weeks off unpaid as I couldn’t walk), then 7 business days off in october 22 for an interstate holiday, and now christmas 22. Each time i have taken a break, in the day or two leading up to my return, I have had terrible feelings about returning to work. I had the same problem most years before returning to school after a mid semester break. During my time between school and my current job, I didn’t have this issue of anxiety returning to work. I enjoyed my role and the people I worked with (even if a few weren’t angels to be around). \n\nI do find myself feeling incredibly inadequate and now unmotivated to continue on my journey at this company. \n\nI think I would like to leave the company and work at a fruit and veg shop that has a position available for me (through a friend - so guaranteed and same or better money) and take some time to learn about myself and get my mental health back together. \n\nShould I take the leap and quit my job?!",

    "text": "I really pissed off my manager. How do I fix this and make what I did benefit them and make it seem like their idea???  I am going to preface this whole thing with a few things and that this will be a long one due to how much is going on in this situation. Each month and each quarter at my job, I have conversations with my manager about my performance and my career development. I had my monthly meeting with my manager in the middle of December. During that conversation, my manager informed me of a few things to work on in related to my performance. I asked my manager what I could do about my career development and what I can do to advance to a manager myself and training for that role. My manager informed me to work on specific things for my performance and that my development can be revisited during my quarterly meeting with them. Then in the middle of January, I had my quarterly meeting with them. My manager instructed me to work on my NPS, which was the only metric I needed to work on, and to improve that. I then inquired about my career development and the training I would need to get to a manager role. My manager informed me that the only way for me to get that role, would be for me to go back inside of a retail store and become a manager there and that’s the only way I could become a manager like them. I was then informed that there was a worker underneath them that was trying to make the leap to manager but they informed them of this same thing and that’s the only way it could be done. They eventually got tired of the poor leadership not giving him any opportunities for advancement, so they left the company. I then reached out to one of my former managers about this situation and my career development and what I was told I had to do in order to advance. My former manager informed me that line of thinking was total bullshit and they gave me some tips. Based off of my former manager’s advice, I reached out to other managers and market managers, both in my area and in different areas. These other managers and market managers are from my current work area and former areas that I have worked in. After thinking about all of this for a couple of weeks, I decided reach out to those other managers and market managers about career development assistance and, so I could build relationships with them. I then got a response back the next day from 5 out of the 6 people I reached out to. I scheduled a meeting with a manager from one of my old areas. I then reached out to my secondary manager because my current manager was off. I asked my secondary manager to block off time on my job board and my secondary manager was upset because I had not asked for \"permission\" from my direct manager about this and that my direct manager is going to be extremely upset about this. My manager basically told me in not so many words during my quarterly conversationn with them that I would have to become a  manager in one of the company's retail locations before I would ever have the chance to become a manager like them. I naturally reached out to other people for my career development. My secondary manager informed me that his was not how they like to do things and since I went over my direct manager's head about this, my career development could be stalled for possibly a very long time. What I took from that was that I could become black listed for not asking my direct manager for \"permission\" first. No expectation was ever set and I was never informed that I had to go to my direct manager for career development and to ask for permission before I would reach out to other managers. Later on that morning, I had a second conversation with my secondary manager and they basically informed me that my current manager was not happy about this and that I did not reach out to them for permission. My secondary manager also informed me that this was not how they do things in their area, that they like to keep everything in house. That if you did not get the training you were supposed to recieve from your direct manager with several months of documentation, then other managers could be contacted for assistance. My secondary manager also informed me that I would have to be in my role for 6 months to a year before they would deem me as mastering my role and then they would have to see that I have the metrics they want and the drive  and ambition for that next step. I have ADHD, ADD, bipolar, and I am possibly autistic, so I learn things at an extremely accelerated pace and I typically master my roles in 3-4 months. My secondary manager was basically saying that they are the ones that approve me for that next step and that I cannot overstep my bounds on that. Well at this point, I have a meeting with both my direct manager and my secondary manager's boss. Their boss reached out to me ecstatic that I had reached out to them for assistance on this matter and my manager's boss's boss was also ecstatic about me reaching out to them and informed me that after my meeting with my manager's boss, that I could reach out to them for additional development if I still wanted to. So I now have a meeting with my direct manager's boss and one of my old managers from a different area and now that this ball is rolling, it cannot be stopped or my career development and assistance would 100% come to a stop. I am trying to find a way to make my direct manager think this was their idea and that me having relationships with higher up managers from my area and in other areas would benefit them so I could assist them more. This way I can get the career development and assistance I need and want to move up to a manager role. Any advice and thoughts on this issue would be greatly appreciated!",

To be direct: I am a Business Analyst with about 4 years of experience working in a tech-as-a-service company in the health insurance field. I have a bachelors in applied statistics and economics. I’ve been at this company for a while now and I guess I’m just trying to figure out what kind of career paths I should be pursuing, as my (albeit limited) research seems to indicate that “business analyst” is kind of an umbrella term and not really a career. I guess I’m just not really sure what “moving forward” is here. \n\nTo be more specific about what I do, I’m basically 1/3rd product manager, 1/3rd data analyst, 1/3rd system analyst/operations. At this point, I could not lateral to a PM position at my current company because it’s pretty small and they wouldn’t let me leave my roll. I also just got a promotion, and am technically a “senior business analyst” now, so idk if it’s better for me to wait a year or if I should try to leverage my new title/salary asap? I make 80k base, but around 100k with overtime. \n\nAs for certifications and such, I don’t have many. I have a degree in stats/economics. I also am a Lean Six Sigma green belt and was planning on going for my black belt soon. I use sql to query info regularly for my job, and I know basic python and R, but I don’t have any certs or anything for coding. \n\nAny advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

    "text": "About Deciding on a Career Path (and a bit more) Hi everyone,\n\nMy question is basically how to decide on a career path, but the post will be a bit long as my background is not very ordinary. I’d appreciate any advise.\n\nI’m (27 M) a 3rd-year(3/4) computer science student from Turkey. I did a detour of studying medicine before this, so I’m officially an M.D. but am not practicing medicine. I’m studying and working as an intern at a very small company doing data engineering for the last few weeks now. I want to move to Europe after graduating next year (maybe US too) if my country doesn't show any sign of improvement.\n\nSome background:\n\nI studied medicine because my parents kind of pushed me into it. Few months before graduating I realized I managed to get through university, but I wasn’t gonna be happy and would have to \"get through my entire career\" if I continued on this path. So I decided to wait a few more months to get the degree and do what I would have done 6 years earlier. Follow something I’m (kind of) passionate about: problem solving, math, computers(spending time looking at a computer screen). I knew nothing more than an average person before starting computer science. I tried learning python by reading an endless blog during med school once. Couldn’t figure out how to stop my while true loop and left it there to study cell biology I completely forgot about now.\n\nRight now I’m still quite far from being competent in any branch of computer science. I’m a decent student. I’m very responsible, have a relatively high GPA and still am kind of smart. But I definitely don’t feel like I did in my prime years of learning. For some of it I blame med school. Since I didn’t like it I just tried to memorize and pass the exams. So I ended up getting dumber and lazier over the years. I forgot most of the math I knew and I’m still not as good as I used to be 10 years ago in high school. The rest is all me as I’m refreshing my social media most of the day and can’t get focused on anything unless I’m trying to automate something in a few hours that takes me 2 seconds a day.\n\nNo matter what, I’m loving computer science and am really glad I started doing this. However, as you might have understood, I’m not very good at letting things go. I couldn’t even quit med school. Now I’m having the same issue with where I want to go with my future career. I “feel like” SWE jobs won’t be very safe from the AI, but I enjoyed my few small projects. I’m kind of into data science and machine learning as there are numbers and I still love numbers, even though I’m not great with them. Finally, I’m learning computer networks this semester and kind of enjoying the assignments so far. I’ll definitely take a cybersecurity course next semester, but other than that I never even used Linux and my knowledge level is watching Mr. Robot if that counts for anything.\n\nI wanna “catch ‘em all” and not give up on anything(\\*) but doesn’t seem realistic or necessary and I’m aware I need to decide before too late as my internships start shaping my career already. Cybersecurity and AI/ML internships are not very easy to come by and unless you have an internship or some serious experience the few positions are very unlikely to hire you as a junior. Initially I was waiting to be taught what I need to learn. Then I realized it won't work this way and I have to practice a lot and trial & error will teach me the most of it. But then I had an exchange semester and an internship that I only wrote a few unit tests.\n\nRight now I'm trying to catch up with everything by doing regular workload of courses, an internship, watching YouTube videos to have some general knowledge about CS etc. But I don't and won't have much time to experience cybersecurity/machine learning/SWE. I can work for hours on end. But while I'm trying to learn Javascript I can't stop thinking \"Why am I not learning cybersecurity right now or trying to make a model to predict the number of players for that game I made a year ago, it will be a good ML practice?\"\n\n**The Question / TLDR:** I'm a bit indecisive and don't have a lot of time to choose between the fields I'm most interested in. So what would you say that I MUST know or experience about each field(cybersecurity, SWE, AI/ML) or in general before deciding on one of the career paths and following it? I'm gonna be 28 when I graduate so I don't really want to continue for an MSc.\n\nSorry for the long post. I wanted to give a proper background and convey my feelings. I read a few posts about physicians considering switching careers, I can also try answering your questions if you have any.\n\n**P.S.:** I had some interviews with companies doing medical stuff but they are all reading and writing medical papers nonstop. I’d have been a professor if I wanted to do that. So unless I can focus mostly on the programming side I don’t really want a job like that (that is unless you want to pay me a lot of money).\n\n(\\*) *“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”* \\- Sylvia Plath",

Bachelors of Computer Science 3.5 GPA & a Bachelors of Psychology\n2. 1+ year of experience as a full stack developer with a small start up. React/Typescript/Python/Postgresql/GCP/Docker. Company was sad to see me go and the founder and my manager both stated they would definitely give me positive referral.\n3. 8+ years of management experience (not in code)\n4. Decent amount of side projects using other languages\n\nI recently got a new job as a \"Database Developer\". I applied to be a full stack engineer at the company and got to the interview portion. I heard I wasn't chosen and thought that was that.\n\nI get an email from someone at the company wanting to talk over the phone. They were very long winded explaining their opinions on a lot of tangential things, as well as the direction for their department, mentioning things like spinning up new repos. They ask about my experience with databases but eventually got to the point of offering me a job with them for a different position. Said I didn't get the job I applied for but that I would be a good fit for this role given my experience.\n\nIn the offer letter the pay was 150% more than what my previous job was paying me, closer to where I live, and some better benefits in terms of 401k.\n\nI finally start, and I come to find out I'm a glorified CRM manager. I'm managing their app in Quickbase. I don't think I'm going to be writing any code for this job, and can't help but feel like this is going to be black mark on resume.\n\nThe work environment also doesn't seem like a place where I would grow much, even if I was writing code for them. They seem very disorganized in terms of roles. No one seems to know what anyone else does and apparently the turnover rate for many of the positions is high.\n\nMy previous job stated the door was still open if I didn't like my new job. I've never done that before and I have my reservations about returning to a job I previously left. I've already started applying to new jobs.\n\nHas anyone had this happen to them, or interviewed people who have had this happen to the them and what was your experience? Would any of you recommend going back to my previous job? Find ways to code in this current job? Just hope it looks good on my resume and jump ship asap?",

    "text": "The Jaguars’ $22 million question: How did four years of theft go undetected? [https://theathletic.com/5129370/2023/12/12/jacksonville-jaguars-amit-patel-credit-card-fraud/](https://theathletic.com/5129370/2023/12/12/jacksonville-jaguars-amit-patel-credit-card-fraud/)\n\nHow could this happen?\n\nThat question swept through the offices of [NFL](https://theathletic.com/nfl/) teams last week after *The Athletic* broke [the news](https://theathletic.com/5118308/2023/12/06/jacksonville-jaguars-employee-theft-amit-patel/) that Amit Patel, 31, a former employee in the finance department of the [Jacksonville Jaguars](https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/jaguars/), allegedly stole more than $22 million from the team over a four-year period.\n\nPatel was a mid-level employee who worked for the Jaguars from 2018-23. He allegedly created fraudulent charges on the club’s virtual credit card and then covered his tracks by sending falsified files to the team’s accounting department. According to a charging document, he used that money to buy vehicles, a condominium and a designer watch worth over $95,000. He also purchased cryptocurrency, splurged on luxury travel for himself and others and used the funds to keep a criminal defense lawyer on retainer. Patel’s attorney said that the vast majority of the $22 million he stole were gambling losses; Patel allegedly [placed bets](https://theathletic.com/5121029/2023/12/07/jaguars-amit-patel-betting-fantasy-losses/) on football and daily fantasy sports with online gambling sites.\n\nPatel is expected to plead guilty to multiple charges — wire fraud and an illegal monetary transaction — in a court appearance Thursday, his attorney, Alex King, said.\n\nIn a statement, the Jaguars said that the franchise engaged “experienced law and accounting firms to conduct a comprehensive independent review, which concluded that no other team employees were involved in or aware of his criminal activity.” That fact makes the question people around the league were asking last week even more salient: How was Patel, working alone, able to steal more than twice the amount quarterback [Trevor Lawrence](https://theathletic.com/nfl/player/trevor-lawrence-0gjixjs0a34LXvKj/) counts against the Jaguars’ salary cap?\n\n*The Athletic* spoke to two people familiar with Patel’s work for the Jaguars as well as nine people who work or have worked in finance for NFL teams or other pro sports franchises. Patel was no mastermind, people who knew him said, but rather a guy in the right place at the right time. The Jaguars may be a franchise worth an estimated $4 billion (according to Forbes), but the team’s finance department was understaffed. And turnover in key positions and a switch to a new credit card system created an opening that Patel exploited. The people who knew him and others who work or have worked for NFL teams questioned why Jacksonville didn’t have better safeguards in place that would have made it more difficult for Patel to get away with what he did and for so long.\n\n“If you’re running a tight business, this would be impossible to pull off more than once,” said a former chief operating officer for an AFC team. “For (four) years, somebody was asleep at the switch.”\n\n“I know people won’t believe it. But he was super basic.”\n\nThat was how one person who knew Patel during his time working for the Jaguars described him. That person and others who spoke to *The Athletic* were granted anonymity to discuss his work, which remains under federal investigation. Patel didn’t wear fancy clothes or flash his new expensive watch or brag about trips he took on private jets with friends. “Aside from the fact that he drove a Tesla, if you were to see Amit, you wouldn’t assume like, Oh, here’s a dude that is siphoning millions of dollars from his job,” the source said.\n\nPatel was friendly and well-liked in the office. His job required him to interact with many department heads, and the source said he had “really great connections with everyone across the organization.” Patel oversaw the budget activity for each department, and he was responsible for helping department heads code individual expenses. If an expense came through on a corporate credit card, Patel was the person Jaguars employees would go to to ask: Hey, where does this need to go?\n\nThe staffing hierarchy for an NFL office is similar to any organization: coordinator, manager, director, vice president, senior vice president. Patel joined the Jaguars in 2018 as the coordinator of financial planning and analysis and was not promoted until three years later — to manager of financial planning and analysis. So the bulk of the alleged fraud occurred when he was a coordinator.\n\nCourt documents detail how Patel helped prepare the Jaguars’ monthly financial statements, oversaw department budgets and acted as the administrator of various programs, including the Jaguars virtual corporate card program. In October 2019, Patel’s direct supervisor, the director of financial planning and analysis, moved to a role in a different department and was not replaced. Two sources familiar with Patel’s work for the team said two other staffers also left the finance department, forcing others, including Patel, to pick up their work. It was not uncommon for staffers to arrive at work at 8 a.m. and not leave until 9 p.m.\n\n“There was some transition in the organization which I believe created an opportunity for this to flourish,” said one source.\n\nAdded King, Patel’s attorney: “They were short-staffed in those departments. Normally you’d have segregation of duties, those kinds of internal checks and balances and they had lost people through attrition. … You’re supposed to have Person A do this part and Person B do this part as a check and balance and segregation of duties and all of a sudden he was doing both roles.”\n\nThe Jaguars switched to a virtual credit card system after Patel had been with the team for about a year. VCCs are considered more secure than having employees carry around physical cards, and they keep the card information private when making online transactions. However, it takes time for employees to transition to the new system, and the person introducing the system is relied upon to answer questions. He or she becomes the go-to, the trusted expert.\n\nPatel was that trusted person in Jacksonville. When he first started managing the VCC program, there was an employee from accounting who checked Patel’s submitted sheets, but then that employee left, and that layer of security also went away.\n\n“The number one rule you learn in accounting is you need to have dual controls for a reason,” said one source.\n\nThe federal charging documents state that as the sole administrator of the VCC program, Patel had the power to create user accounts, approve new VCCs, request changes to the available credit for the VCCs, and classify all VCC transactions in the Jaguars’ general ledger. Each month, he created an “integration file” that listed each VCC transaction with cost coding information. But instead of accurately reporting the VCC transactions, Patel is alleged to have created fraudulent entries using a variety of methods to ensure that the total dollar amount of VCC expenses matched the balances paid by the Jaguars. Charging documents state that he “identified legitimate recurring VCC transactions, such as catering, airfare and hotel charges, and then duplicated those transactions; he inflated the amounts of recurring VCC transactions; he entered completely fictitious transactions that might sound plausible, but that never actually occurred; and he moved legitimate VCC charges from upcoming months into the month of the integration file that was immediately due to the accounting department.”\n\nPeople who might assume an NFL franchise would be a tightly monitored operation are not wrong. Still, in Jacksonville, that description only applied to the football side of the business, because the league office monitors each team for salary cap compliance.\n\n“We were so anal about everything,” said a former Jacksonville employee on the football side. “It went down to the penny. Constant communication with internal accounting, constant communication with the NFL management council, with player personnel (in) NFL headquarters, so by the time an official audit (from the NFL) came down, it was yesterday’s news.”\n\nAudits of the non-football side of the Jaguars did happen, according to a source, but they did not scrutinize every transaction. “The thing with any audit is everything is samples. So if they pull a sample and the support aligns and supports the transaction, then there are not that many questions.”\n\nIn 2019, the FBI [caught](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edca/pr/former-sacramento-kings-executive-sentenced-7-years-prison-multimillion-dollar-fraud) Sacramento Kings chief revenue officer Jeff David stealing $13.4 million from five companies by representing to them that payments they made were going to the Kings, when instead they were going to bank accounts that only he controlled. David was sentenced to seven years in prison but [was granted an early release](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/local/former-sacramento-kings-executive-released-from-prison-early/103-96ec0c10-7860-4611-a04c-b7266ef08ee0) in September 2023.\n\nAn [ESPN article ](https://www.google.com/search?q=How+NBA+executive+Jeff+David+stole+%2413+million+from+the+Sacramento+Kings&oq=How+NBA+executive+Jeff+David+stole+%2413+million+from+the+Sacramento+Kings&aqs=chrome..69i57.15538j1j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)chronicling the mess in Sacramento described how it became a “cautionary tale” within [NBA](https://theathletic.com/nba/) circles, with CFOs sharing different methods of internal stress tests at the league’s annual sales and marketing meeting. One NBA team president told ESPN the franchise “initiated a full audit of its operations” days after David’s fraud became public knowledge.\n\nDavid was a top executive stealing from other companies, not a lower-level employee allegedly defrauding his own organization. But the reaction from the NBA community mirrors what is now happening across the NFL.\n\n“We saw a mess out there with the Sacramento Kings, so it’s not the first time,” one current AFC team president said. “But you certainly step back and think, what do we have in place?”\n\nAccording to interviews with officials from other NFL teams as well as individuals working in finance at other professional sports franchises, the Jaguars may be an outlier in how little they were doing to monitor an employee with so much control over spending. Most of those interviewed were gobsmacked that one person would have unchecked oversight of the VCC setup.\n\n“Talk about having egg on your face. That’s a whole f—-ing omelet,” said a former finance specialist for an [NHL](https://theathletic.com/nhl/) team.\n\nA former finance employee for an NFC team said that their CFO ran the corporate card program, accounts payable received the statements for the cards, and then a manager approved each report. That finance employee reviewed the court filing that detailed Patel’s alleged crimes and said the sheer number of falsified transactions he created should have resulted in detection at an earlier point.\n\n“A lot of times a big number might not look like an outlier,” said a former chief administrative officer of an NFL team. “Usually, you have someone who charges a payment and then expenses it to someone else. Then the money comes back to the budget and you see the figure hitting your account as an outflow of cash. Someone would notice if they turned in a bill for $100,000 and it was paid out by someone else at $150,000.”\n\nBut if one person handles multiple layers of the process, it can go “upside-down” quickly. “It certainly was a flawed system they had in Jacksonville,” he said. “Somebody was given way too much leeway and way too much trust.”\n\nA former NFL COO said in a text message that he had “never heard of an employee having that kind of access without layered controls in place. … Usually everybody up to and including CEO level has another party who has to approve expenses. Sometimes it might be at a certain level (say above $10k) but their situation sounds highly unusual.”\n\nAnother former NFL COO said that Patel’s alleged fraud would likely have been detected at his organization because his fraudulent charges would have blown the annual budget. “Once a fiscal year was underway, each department head would receive a monthly update of expenses for the month versus the plan. Sometimes the actual spending might vary from the planned spending for simple timing reasons. Anything over a 5 percent variance would receive scrutiny from a number of sources including the finance department, the person that budget reported to and/or myself,” he said in a text message.\n\nThe spreadsheet integration file Patel allegedly falsified might not have even been reviewed by superiors, said the former finance employee for an NFC team, but rather something that accounting merely uploaded to a server. “It’s accounts payable, so that’s not like a fine tooth comb. When it gets back to accounts payable, you’re under the assumption that it’s all taken care of, and it’s ready to be paid,” the employee said.\n\nA third former COO explained that teams often undergo three different audits annually: a league audit focused on compliance with the salary cap, then two others, one done internally, then another initiated by a banking institution (if the team borrows money). The internal audit would have been the one most likely to detect Patel’s alleged fraud, the COO explained.\n\nThe finance people who spoke to *The Athletic* said they expected NFL teams to review their reporting structure and potentially beef up those internal audits in light of what happened in Jacksonville. The senior members of the Jaguars’ financial operations while Patel was there remain in their posts. According to the team’s website, the organization has increased the size of the finance department by six employees since Patel was fired in February. Two of those positions are new — a vice president of accounting, and a senior manager of accounting. The team added in a statement: “With the assistance of external experts, (the organization) has extensively reviewed its own policies and procedures, added staff to its finance department, and taken other measures to ensure the integrity of its financial controls.”\n\nAs for Patel, his attorney said Patel checked himself into an inpatient recovery center this past spring and has cooperated with the government and the Jaguars. King said his client is remorseful, takes “full responsibility for his actions” and has opened a gambling addiction recovery center, where he plans to be “active in the treatment community.”\n\nHe was also working for Uber, driving the black Tesla that is referenced in court documents as one of the spoils from his alleged crimes. (His attorney said Patel purchased the car with his own money.)\n\nA few days before his alleged fraud became a national headline, Patel picked up Chris Chaney, a product marketer from Cincinnati, and his wife from the Jacksonville airport and drove them 40 minutes to their Airbnb in Jacksonville Beach. They were in town to see the [Bengals](https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/bengals/) play the Jaguars.\n\nChaney said Patel made small talk as he drove, pointing out the country club where he is a member and telling the couple he’d been a Jaguars fan since he moved to Jacksonville as a kid. Patel told Chaney he’d worked in finance for the team but was recently laid off because of some restructuring.",

    "text": "Should I accept promotion, even if I know I do not want the job? Was previously in a management role (tech start up) and burned out due to insane hours + ever increasing amount of responsibilities. I moved to an IC role at a F500 a little over a year ago. Job is pretty chill, with minimal OT except 5-10 OT hours for 2 weeks during QE. OT would be way worse, but I have managed to automate a lot of things and set boundaries, but still am fully busy 40 hours a week, even during non close weeks. Fully remote, comfortable salary, but not great for COL. Overall, I could stay in this role for another year or two easily. \n\nWas recently asked if I wanted to move into management role at my current company. This would involve hiring a team of 2 underneath me and taking on other areas that have been huge black holes at our company and passed around from team to team (dumpster fires). I should be happy as the pay is a decent increase and I don’t want to say in an IC role forever…..\n\nHowever, all managers and above here seem completely overworked and tend to work weekends at least 1x per ME and late nights are expected / routine. The previous person in the role left after 5 months and about half of the team has quit in the past year. Company has also gone through layoffs recently and is very slow to backfill on any roles, resulting in long hours for the unfortunately ones who are tasked with keeping things moving (managers).\n\nShould I still take the promotion even if I know this is not a role I would ever accept if I was interviewing externally? On one hand, I don’t see any point in turning down promotion, as I don’t want to stay at my current level forever and more work will probably be put on my plate anyways. Can always use title bump on my resume I guess, but what worries me is always a chance my next role is way worse than my current IC, fully remote, six figure job. However, the hours, huge workload, stress and shit WLB is something I have discussed with therapist and we have agreed upon that I need to avoid after my last burn out. Not lazy, just have no drive to be a CFO or work 50 hours a week for the rest of my life, but don’t want to be a senior forever.",

You're sick of the grind, and the pizza parties just aren't cutting it.\n\nI'm here to listen. I want your feedback.  I want your honest, critical feedback about your terrible (and not terrible) experience at a public accounting firm.\n\nI am a partner at a Canadian firm.  We're a small group, with a team of 75-100.   Over the years, I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly of public accounting. I've read countless stories on this subreddit about the challenges and frustrations many of you face in the industry. \n\nI'm here to listen.  I am asking for your honest, critical feedback about your terrible (and not terrible) experience at a public accounting firm.\n\n**Firm Structure:** What do you believe is the ideal firm structure? Do you value a hierarchical system, or would you prefer a more flat and collaborative environment? \n\n**Specialization vs. Generalization:** Do you find value in being a specialist in a particular niche, or do you prefer a broader scope of work that allows you to handle various tasks? \n\n**Career Aspirations:** How many of you envision yourselves becoming partners in the future? Alternatively, do you see yourself more in a managerial role, guiding and mentoring the next generation? \n\n**Work-Life Balance:** This is a big one. What does the ideal work-life balance look like to you? How can firms better support this balance, especially during the notorious busy seasons? When reviewing annual hours, the partners are consistently at the top of the list.  I hate it.  Do I want staff to work more? *Absolutely not*.  I want to work less.\n\n**Benefits & Compensation:** We all know that a competitive salary is essential, but beyond that, what benefits truly matter to you? For those familiar with the Canadian market, what are your salary expectations for various roles?\n\nI understand the challenges of wanting increased wages and reduced hours. It's a tough balance to strike, especially when we consider the financial implications.  We have continued to cut down on our own draw to be able to provide more staff positions.\n\n**If You Were in My Shoes:** Imagine you're the managing partner.

    "text": "Waterhouse Five There  at the corner, in the front rank of pedestrians, was an Assurance  Associate who had been working all day. He was a professional, but his  posture was polished. He had served in many industries. The sight of  John, a Consultant, offended him, especially after he learned that John  was from PwC. It seemed to the Assurance Associate that John was in  abominable taste, and supposed that John had gone to a lot of silly  trouble to dress himself just so.  \n\nThe Assurance Associate spoke English, and he said to John, \"I take it you find Accountancy a very comical thing.\"  \n\nJohn looked at him vaguely. John had lost track momentarily of  where he was or how he had gotten there. He had no idea that people  thought he was clowning. It was his job, of course, which had dressed  him up - his job and a feeble desire to impress his clients.  \n\n\"Did you expect us to laugh?\" the Assurance Associate asked him.  The Assurance Associate was demanding some sort of satisfaction. John  was mystified. John wanted to be friendly, to help, if he could, but his  resources were meager. His fingers now held the two objects from his  briefcase. John decided to show the Assurance Associate what they were.  \n\n\"You thought we would enjoy being mocked?\" the Assurance  Associate said. \"And do you feel proud to represent PwC as you do?\" John  withdrew a hand from his briefcase, held it under the Assurance  Associate's nose. On his palm rested a stack of documents and a business  card. The business card was an unremarkable little artifact - white and  black and red. John smiled.  \n\nThe parade pranced, staggered, and reeled to the lobby of the  PwC office building, and then it went inside. The office wasn't a  bustling place any more. Almost all the accounting and consulting work  in the world had been done and reviewed and audited by professionals,  mostly from Deloitte. So it goes.  \n\nThe consultants were taken to the fifth floor of the building.  It was a sleek modern space with sliding doors in front and back. It had  been built as a conference room. Now it was going to serve as a home  away from home for one hundred PwC consultants. There were desks and  chairs, and two coffee machines and a water dispenser. Behind it was a  restroom, which was a private space with stalls.  \n\nThere was a big number over the door of the floor. The number  was five. Before the consultants could go inside, their project manager  told them to memorize their simple floor number, in case they got lost  in the big office. Their floor number was this: *Wasserhaus-Funf*.  *Wasserhaus* meant Waterhouse. *Funf* was good old five.",

I’m halfway through my first client and I realized none of this work is interesting to me at all (ERP focus with minimal strategy work). The team is honestly great and the culture is fantastic but the work is just mind numbing to me.

I have seen many people from my exact team in this big 4 exit to a Director position in pretty chill F500 firms. My main concerns are whether I look like a black sheep exiting this early and whether I should even do it if it means losing out on many exit opportunities? \n\nTLDR - Is it inappropriate to leave in the first 6 months if you find the work boring with no other major problems?

    "text": "Deliver with partial assumption vs deliver with detailed requirement from customer Hi consultants of Reddit, I have a work dilemma which I would like to pick y'all expert minds here.\n\nI am on a case to help client develop a new sales report for their management, requestor is a mid-senior manager, new to the system the company uses. Upon analyzing the format given, some data and column name were confusing to understand what data is required here, the manager wasn't sure where those information should source from and need to confirm with the end user almost all the time. Despite the clear objective of this report is simple, to review gross profit by service item, this process of \"let me check with my end user\" has dragged this request for more than a month and it is still going, which is not looking good for my company and client's management is not happy for the slow service.\n\nSo here's my dilemma, I have gathered what I can to piece the report formula together but I'm not sure if that is 100% what the client wants. Do I deliver the report based on what I understand the client wants(since they take too long to come back with a firm answer) OR do I continue to follow up and make sure client agrees with the requirements, only then I proceed to get technical to develop it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first is quicker, but leaves room for wrong deliverables. Wrong requirement = time wasted to develop = unable to bill customer and still need to fix it. The latter is slower, but makes sure both parties align, billable time, if client claims the report is not as per what they want(which happens quite often with this account), there's always black and white to fall back on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe PM in the house is against the latter as we come off as incapable to understand what client wants and unable to offer sound advice, but the technical department is against the latter because we're wasting resources if we can't bill the deliverables and need to make changes again. Sadly, the work culture in my country, making error is frowned upon in comparison to western culture that may be more open to admit that they don't know everything.\n\nHappy to hear some opinion here.",

Valet is amazing and they even gave us a free upgrade! Our experience was going well until we decided to extend our stay. That's when things took a turn for the worst.\n\n\nThe manager, a middle-aged white woman who spoke at least three languages, seemed nice enough. I hadn't thought much about her when I saw her at the front desk. We let her know that we wanted to extend our stay and she said of course. It wasn't until she looked down at her screen that her entire demeanor changed.\n\n\n She mentioned that we were given a free upgrade and looked appalled. She said that we would have to pay for the upgrade moving forward and we were fine with that. She typed something into the system and said we needed to scan our credit card again so that they could put another 250-dollar hold on our account for incidentals. Okay, inconvenient but understandable.\n\n\nAfter we scanned our card I couldn't tell if she needed anything else because she went silent and stopped interacting with us. I asked if she needed anything else from us and she dismissively shrugged her shoulders, put her hands up, and said \"I don't know.\" We thanked her and she responded with an insincere thank you.\n\n\nTo make a long story shorter our hotel stay concluded with this hotel manager directing the front desk staff, bellhop, and valet to withhold our belongings and vehicle until we gave them our credit card for a third time at checkout. Even though they had already placed multiple holds on our card totaling 500 dollars and it was still reflected on our online banking statement. \n\n\n By the end of our stay both my brother and I felt afraid and unwelcomed. I think the manager specifically directed her staff to make our stay unpleasant. We felt bullied by the hotel staff.\n\n\nAfter we checked out, one of the managers (who was a white man) asked me about my stay. Usually I'm too afraid to speak up but I was honest and told him that my experience was rude and racist outside of the stellar treatment I received from valet. He told me that my experience wasn't the only one and that this has happened to multiple other guests. He said that he personally has spoken with upper management about it but they refuse to do anything.\n\n\nI don't want this to happen to other families but this problem appears to be systemic and I don't know if there is any way that I can bring about real change. I need your advice ladies 🙏🏿❤️ What should I do?\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: Thank you all so much for your support ❤️❤️ I definitely will see who I can contact in corporate. I was afraid to say the name but I hate feeling like I have to keep others comfortable even when they have no regard for my own comfort. \n\nUpdate #2: You all are so amazing 😭 Thank you for validating my feelings. I'm sorry I haven't responded to everyone yet. Since you all have been so amazing I want to be vulnerable with you guys. My mental health has been suffering a bit after this. I've just been on edge and anxious. I keep going between anger and feeling helpless. I'm going to talk to my therapist. But I was embarrassed that I wasn't over everything the next day. Just taking some time for me ❤️❤️❤️ You all are truly so supportive! Thank you so much 🫂\n\n\n\nThe hotel is the InterContinental Montreal, an IHG Hotel ✨\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a list of some of the microaggressions I experienced during my stay: (unfortunately, my instincts were right. I already had a strong sense of unease after the first microaggression and it meant that something worse was ahead)\n\n\n\n- While waiting at the hotel restaurant to order a soda my brother was told \"You know this isn't free right?\" we were then told that we couldn't charge it to our room because they didn't know if our card would work.\n\n\n- Security started banging on our door at 10:58 pm Sunday night to let us know that we needed to turn our TV down.  We were watching cartoon network at level 27 out of at least 60-something volume levels. I'm not even sure if their we're other guests staying in the rooms next to us and a curfew wasn't mentioned or posted anywhere visible.\n\n\n- I couldn't sleep the night that they sent security up to our room and I started reading more of their online reviews. Unsurprisingly, the hotel has a history of racist and homophobic profiling as well as assaulting hotel guests of color.\n\n\n- Someone was sent to knock on our door at 11:57 am to let us know that we needed to check out and had 5 more minutes. The posted check-out time was 12 noon.\n\n\n- A member of housekeeping admitted to going through our personal items and throwing away a bag with my brother's art supplies and antique coins because they thought it was trash. We went to them directly because we didn't want to put her job at risk. She kept nervously laughing and made it seem like we were inconveniencing her before she brought it up to the front desk.\n\n\n- A hotel member at the front desk said that they would comp our breakfast and 1 day's parking for throwing away our belongings but they still sent someone to knock on our door about payment. They also called us afterwards because they thought the manager only directed them to cover two breakfast items and not our full breakfast.\n\n\n- When we ordered dinner they also sent someone to knock on the door afterwards and called us to collect payment. We asked them to charge it to the room when we ordered. \n\n\n \n\n\nTLDR: I experienced prejudice on nearly every level of service interaction I had at one of the largest globally recognized hotel chains in the world. I believe I was targeted as a queer black woman with dreadlocks. (I literally had specially done rainbow nails too). I believe the woman responsible for this treatment is the manager of the hotel and I found out that this hotel has a history of profiling and assaulting guests of color. I don't want this to happen to anyone else and I'm not sure how to proceed. This problem appears to be systemic, so is there any way for me to make a difference?",

    "text": "Are you really protecting your peace? Or are you just a bad friend?.. I’m sorry this is long but I just really need to get this out. I was having lunch today at work (I work at a center and the demographic is mostly other black women mid twenties-late 30’s) and the conversation came up about friends who drain you. One coworker mentioned she just had to cut off a friend because she was “toxic” and she said she had to cut her off to protect her peace. I asked her what made her say her friend was toxic, and she said that basically her friend is autistic and when they go out, if she tries to get her friend to go somewhere other than where they were supposed to go, or stay out later she throws a little “temper tantrum”. She says she also gets really unreasonably upset at “little shit” like if she invites other people to hang out with them without talking to her first. She said she acts childish a lot and is a know it all. \n\nEverybody seemed to be in agreement that her friend just seemed completely unreasonable. I said that everything she’s saying is toxic are symptoms of autism. Another coworker said having autism isn’t an excuse for toxic behavior and her friend needs to be held accountable regardless of her diagnosis. I normally agree with that. I do believe that people should be held accountable for their actions and shouldn’t use their disabilities as an excuse, however, when you’re dealing with mental illness or like being on the spectrum having an episode,(especially when somebody is doing something that is clearly one of your triggers) is sometimes not avoidable. \n\nI mentioned this, I kind of just said, well it’s not an excuse but it is an explanation. Although you might not agree with the way she expresses her emotions as long as she isn’t being abusive, as her friend I would think you would be a little bit more empathetic? Her emotions are coming from a real place. \n\nAgain I was met with blank stares. It was quiet for a minute and then the first coworker explained that her friend has been going to behavior therapy and taking medication for “quite sometime now”, and she should be getting better. I didn’t say anything this time but the dialogue that was going on in my head was screaming. As someone who struggles with mental health this conversation was digging up some painful memories from my own life. Cycles and lost friendships. I’ve gotten so much better at navigating relationships but my heart was kind of breaking for this girl whose “friend” thought this way about her. \n\nDo neurotypical  people really think that people with mental disorders just go to therapy and magically no longer have them? Likeee???? Therapy teaches us how to fit in with the rest of society so we don’t scare people lol. It teaches us how to mask. How to better *manage* our disorders, and how to be functioning members of society. We still have all of the symptoms, we’re basically just pretending to be someone completely different from ourselves in order to be accepted.\n\nWhy is it *only* up to the people who have these disorders to navigate these relationships. Like if my friend told me they have a certain physical disorder like a peanut allergy, is it up to them to make sure they aren’t going around peanuts? Absolutely. Is it also my responsibility as their friend and as someone who cares about them to make sure I’m not endangering them by bringing peanuts around them? Also absolutely. So how come when the disorder is mental it’s not treated the same? If you’re doing something to your friend (even if you think it’s not that big of a deal) and it elicits a negative response every time, *why* would you keep doing it? And why does their *response* to you toxic? \n\n\nMost people would just say “get better friends!”. The problem with telling someone who has a mental disorder to just get better friends is that a lot of times we can’t recognize when someone is hurting us or tell how people are truly feeling. We can’t read between the lines. We don’t recognize abusive patterns the same way other people do. Therapy can help but there’s a reason people with certain mental disorders are more likely to be taken advantage of or victims of abuse. We tell our closest friends about our disorders and most of the time they tell us they understand and they support us. And they do. Until you exhibit a symptom. Then we’re toxic and needy and childish. It’s important to establish boundaries but some of these boundaries are really just people being horrible friends and using “protecting my peace” as an excuse.  \n\nI’m sorry this was so long! I’m just so sick of seeing it and hearing the same tired protecting my peace line over and over again. The neurodivergents are tiredd lol.",

I would say that I am really confident in my skills and I do my job extremely well. I’ve been employed at my current position for 6 months. It’s a fairly big, super busy family medicine practice with 7 providers. For context I am the only black woman in the office and the place I work is heavily populated with Mormons . \n\nSince I started I have been constantly micromanaged by my lead. She is always watching everything I do, taking small matters and making them bigger than they are. Like I said I have over 7 years experience and am pretty well rounded MA, but since working here I’ve been made to feel incompetent. I never received my uniform pants that I was suppose to get at my 90 days , it’s month 6. Never received an update on when they will arrive , only thing my manager says to me about 2 weeks ago was “wow your scrubs haven’t arrived since I’ve been gone on vacation?” Shrugs her shoulders and says,“Well it’s nothing personal. “ whatever that means. Being micromanaged on top of working 10 hour days I can say I’m done and I put my two weeks in last week. A girl who was hired a month after me (who is Mormon and hired based on knowing the Dr who is also Mormon ) already received her uniforms and they are a way nicer than the ones I received. They also rushed to get her signed up with hospital portals and I still have to ask my co workers to print me hospital records which puts me behind when I’m rooming my patients. \n\nToday we had our meeting (I was a little late to the meeting as I was wrapping up with patients) My manager decides to bring up race. She said out of no where , “ just so everyone is clear we give raises and bonuses based on how hard you work  , not based on the color of your skin. We don’t care how much melanin you have. “ Everyone seemed confused as this should already be implied, it is common sense. It left me feeling extremely uncomfortable, and confused. I’m questioning if I want to complete my two weeks or just say good freaking bye to this place. FYI I have never brought up race in my place of work. I do my job and go home.",

    "text": "Health PSA for my ladies I recently talked to my aunt about my baby cousin (gen Z) who has been having health issues for a while. She and my aunt have both been overweight all their lives and have a tough time managing their weight. I have medical background so they come to me sometimes with concerns. \n\nMy aunt told me that when my cousin was in high school, she was worried for her because she would bleed for almost two weeks. Her cycle would come about every three weeks but would last so long it almost seemed like she only had about a week between each cycle. \n\nThey took her to the hospital and the (white male) doctor told her that is was “normal for African women” to bleed longer and that her weight was probably the cause. He offered no tests or follow ups and she felt he basically dismissed it as “black women are fat, that makes them bleed more.” Thankfully they never went back to him, but she also never went in for a second opinion. \n\nWhen I found out I called my cousin and asked her about this. She told me that some of her friends experience the same thing and it’s so painful that most days she’s in bed and had to drop a college course because she was missing too many days.\n\nThis is NOT normal. No matter your body type. This is akin to hemorrhaging.\n\nI urged her to go see a gyno asap. Thankfully they did as soon as they could and they found MULTIPLE CYSTS on her fallopian tubes that have grown past average size and was close to rupturing. They also found scaring inside her uterus that is being investigated. \n\nThe doctor said that if she had let it go for a couple more years, she would have had to have a hysterectomy…she’s only 23. If the doctor would have caught it while she was young, she would have been able to possibly have them removed and she wouldn’t be experiencing so much bleeding and pain.\n\nIf a doctors “advice” doesn’t sit well with you, ALWAYS seek a second opinion. Don’t just brush it off. Please ♥️",

They sacrificed so much to make sure we were fed and educated.\n\nNow, I have everything I need. An advanced degree, family, friends, great partnership, cats, steady employment, food and shelter... but I wake up everyday wishing I died in my sleep. \n\nI cry at my desk instead of working. I can't make myself focus or care, and it's affecting my performance. I'm the only black person in my department (damn near the whole company) and the shame is so overwhelming, I feel like I'm proving a bad impression of my race by not excelling. I'm constantly needing extensions on deadlines and taking time off. It's only by my manager's kindness and grace that I still have this job. And I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. I'm past the point of caring if I get fired, the company would be better off without me weighing them down. I don't even want another job, I just want to not exist.\n\nI tried volunteering as an esl tutor to focus my mind on giving back to my community. I'm failing my student. I can't muster up the energy to create lesson plans in time and have been missing sessions.\n\nMy cats deserve a mom who can play with them instead of curling up in bed as soon as I get home. \n\nMy partner deserves to not have to give me pep talks to do the simplest tasks. I don't want to be a financial liability if I loose this job and can't find a similar paying one. I want to give them permission to leave me before shit hits the fan and I'm unemployed. \n\nI'm a functioning adult in a first world country. I have nothing to be sad about in my life. I've been through countless depressive cycles that I've crawled out of, just to fall in again. I'm in therapy and on antidepressants. So many people who are helping me and it's going to waste. \n\nI'm the problem. I'm so ashamed of myself. I wish I could give my life to someone who would make the most of it, like my cousins in Nigeria. I'm not supposed to be here.

I wish my love for them was enough to make me want to stay here. \n\nI know I'm not alone, countless people are going through this and worst. How are you coping? Especially those over 30.\n\nIf you made it this far thanks for reading me vent. I love yall and wish you peace, safety, and fulfillment in life ❤️ \n\nP.S.

    "text": "Trying to support black owned businesses but it’s been difficult. How to provide constructive criticism? Update: \n\n“Thank you all for providing feedback. I was really seeking guidance in this matter because I do want for the majority of businesses that I support to be black owned. For a short time during my teen years, I lived in a racist town and it really opened my eyes to how yt and some other non-black people viewed us. They want our money, but don’t respect us. So, that is my reason for wanting to support for black owned businesses. But if I’m going to support I need to feel like I’m valued as a customer, communication is good, and that my money is well spent. That’s just me. Sorry if I offend anyone with my views. \n\nThat being said, I did communicate with the meal prep service mentioned earlier (run by a couple) that was taking 24 hours for each response (last response was a little over 48 hours ago). I simply let them know that I did sign up for another service (local woman owned, responded very quickly, she delivers, and has a bigger following with all great reviews). I let them know that the huge lag in response did not make me feel comfortable in pursuing their service. I let them know that communication would’ve been nice. So if they were busy, just letting me know and giving me a time frame of when they would reach out. I’m understanding, but if I don’t know what is going on then I can’t just sit around. I’m pursuing this option because I just had a baby and working and I needed help. So I ended it with I am not trying to offend, simply just providing my feedback as a potential customer. This was all done on Facebook Messenger. \n\nI also want to mention that I have frequented plenty of wonderful black owned businesses in my area. My Loctician is professional, on time, organized, communicative, and friendly. The local beauty shop I visit is black owned and lovely, clean, professional. Just to name a few. \n\nI’m pretty simple, I think. Just be professional and a good communicator. Keep pride in your space (clean, organized). Sell a good product. Simple.“\n\n\nOriginal post: \nSo I’ve been trying VERY hard to support black owned businesses. I attempted to hire a personal trainer. I recently had a baby, want to lose this weight! I emailed this woman because she owns her gym and is right down the street. She advertised her services in my community group page, so I emailed. She emailed back and stated that she herself had 3 C-sections and that she understood what I would need. I was hyped! I attempted to schedule a time with her…a few times… but she just ghosted me. I gave up after the 5th email. \nI tried hiring a meal prep service. Local service, black owned, but the communication has been TERRIBLE and slow. I’ll message, and she (the partner of the chef) will message back 24 hours later. So it’s been slow communication for 2 days now. All I’ve told her is I want 5 meals. I wanted to start right away. I have instead signed up for a local meal kit delivery service, woman owned. Still waiting for a reply from the black owned place but I won’t be pursuing their service. \nVisited a few black owned restaurants recently. Out of the 3 that I have been to this month, I only ate at 1. The other 2 we just walked out. 1 place was rude. The other place was unprofessional. New speakeasy spot, we were super excited. Seated at the bar, very small space and no one really in there. Took 20 minutes to get our drink order, BUT the drinks that my family wanted were only able to be served at the table not the bar??? What?! We left. \nI had 1 positive black owned food experience. Great customer service, AMAZING food! But idk if I’d be comfortable going back. It was a good truck, I got a free meal due to being a Yelp Elite. When the truck opened, customers were about to FIGHT over some fried chicken! What?! Then tried to rope me in. I backed away and said I just want to get home to my baby, leave me alone, it’s just chicken! So I definitely want to return for the food, but with someone. Nothing the owner can do about this, I just know now how to proceed with this business. \n\nAnyways, I want to support these businesses. But in order to do so I need to feel like my money is being well spent. I want to see these businesses improve and thrive. I see too many black owned businesses shut down. Do you think they would be receptive to constructive criticism? Should I ask to speak to a manager the next time I experience something like this? I usually post on Yelp, but idk if they see those (not every business is active on there). What has been your experience with giving feedback? Did it help? TIA",

I 100% sympathize with those of you tired of reading ‘woe is me black woman’ content — if this is you please don’t read this one ❤️ \n\nBut my GOD. I live in a very white and very Asian region. I am treated like absolute shit day to day. I really can’t even say anything about the racism I experience because right now Asian people have the ear of white people as long as they’re hating on black people and white people here? Well they don’t want me here at all in the first place. So I just get double the whoop ass everyday, at work, at the grocery store, at the gym, everywhere. \n\nI’ve had one too many experiences that leave me with the feeling that people are just plain UNCOMFORTABLE with my presence. And it’s not just white people. I’ve had south Asian immigrants (not assuming, in this case there was verification as they did not yet speak English) literally look terrified that I was going to hurt or steal from them because I was walking behind them (they were in my way). \n\nThen being completely ignored or dismissed by staff at restaurants, stores, the hospital, you name it. While they address the white or Asian person in front of or behind me.\n\nAnd today, I just fucking lost it. I was at the store standing in line with a full buggy and an Asian man looked me in the eyes while he sprinted just to stand in front of me with two items. I stared, because it was just ridiculous. He says “oh I didn’t mean to cut you” and just turns around. I respond “oh it’s alright” and he literally just doesn’t acknowledge me further. Had I been angry, this would’ve beeen another instance of “discrimination”. \n\nThen a black attendant sees what happens and offers to take me in his line (express line) and I say okay. I take my big ass buggy (with a scared looking Asian couple in front of me) and then the white manager comes roaring in screaming “no you can’t be here it’s the express lane!!” \n\nThe whole store turns around and stares at me as she keeps yelling and I’m struggling with my buggy, including the guy who cut me, as if I’m causing a commotion. The same terrified looks I’ve become used to, even though I’m small and scared myself when I’m alone. It’s like a spotlight is on me at all times and I have no advocate.\n\nI lose my place in line and the stares continue as I move back. It may seem small but this is just one story in a million where I’m treating like Quasimodo in a big blue state for being unambiguously black. \n\nI’m sick of it. I’m tired. I’m tired of being told I have to be strong. Who do I owe strength to? \n\nEnd rant. I am over today.",

    "text": "Many studies show black men face more discrimination than black women. Here is the evidence: Intersectional feminists often argue that black women have it the worst, and they suffer worse than black men because they're black and a woman. Well guess what? There's lots of evidence that shows black men face more discrimination than black women.\n\nThis [article](https://theconversation.com/black-men-face-high-discrimination-and-depression-even-as-their-education-and-incomes-rise-141027) by *The Conversation* elaborates on what black men deal with. According to study 1, black boys from the wealthiest families were the most depressed. Study 2 found that for black men, the highest education credentials were associated with an increase, not decrease, in depressive symptoms. Study 3 found that in a nationally representative sample of American adults, black men with the highest income had the highest risk of depression, specifically major depressive disorder. Interpersonal or one-on-one discrimination was not found to be a factor. Study 4 found that 700 black teenagers were followed for two decades in Flint, Michigan. Perceived racial discrimination was measured in 1999 and 2002. Discrimination as teens was a predictor of depressive symptoms in people transitioned to young adulthood a decade later. Nonetheless, this was only true for black men, but not black women. In that same study in Flint, an increase in perceived neighborhood fear, defined as being scared of the crime and violence in the neighborhood, was linked with an increase in depressive symptoms for black men, but not black women. Study 6 found on IAT tests that white men had higher racist attitudes towards black people than white women, but the difference wasn't particularly extreme, but statistically significant. Nonetheless, white women also can be really racist towards black people, too.\n\nBlack men also get arrested, incarcerated and stopped or profiled far more than black women. Even white men experience being arrested and incarcerated far more than black women. And the reason why most prisoners are men isn't simply because men commit crime more. [A significant minority of criminals are women](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/xyl5wb/statistics_cited_women_are_more_likely_to_commit/), but female criminals are severely underreported, get arrested less when reported, are less likely to be incarcerated when convicted, are paroled earlier, and given more lenient sentences compared to men. Additionally, black men are far more likely than anyone else to be killed by police. [In fact](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-06/race-and-police-shootings-what-new-research-says), white and Asian men were much more likely than even black or Native American women to be killed by police. Almost all police homicide victims were men! [Black men were also much more likely than anyone, even black women, to be murdered in general](https://www.niussp.org/health-and-mortality/americas-high-homicide-rate/?print=print). [Black men are also more likely than black women to be victims of crime in general](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/bvvc.pdf). [Black men also were](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/05/02/for-black-americans-experiences-of-racial-discrimination-vary-by-education-level-gender/) more likely to be subject to racial slurs/jokes, be unfairly stopped by a police officer, have people act suspicious towards them, been assumed to be prejudiced, or to have feared for their personal safety. In fact, 59% of black men had been unfairly stopped by police, compared to just 31% of black women.\n\nAnother study called \"[Gender Matters Too](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2008-05171-002)\" found black men and women in 11th grade classrooms differed in their perception of peer and classroom discrimination. For boys, discrimination harmed their grades, attitudes and their regard for the importance of school. For girls, however, the effects generally had a positive impact. Another [study](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspa0000288) found that the real root of racism towards blacks was perceived threat, not dislike, and that people were racist toward black people not due to negativity towards them but feeling threatened by them, especially black men. When isolating negativity from threat, they found no automatic black-negativity link. Negativity towards blacks was associated with viewing them as a threat. [In fact](https://polisci.osu.edu/sites/polisci.osu.edu/files/mcconnaughy_white.pdf), another study found that people viewed black men as particularly violent, and viewed white men as more violent than black women. They ascribed a low amount of violent personalities to black women and an especially low amount of it to white women. They viewed black men as more promiscuous than white men, white men as more promiscuous than black women, white women slightly more promiscuous than black women! They viewed black men as less intelligent than black women, and viewed black men as less ambitious than black women. Fast responders gave unpleasant responses to black men far more than to black women. All responders gave black men the most unpleasant responses compared to black women and white men and women, and black women slightly less unpleasant responses compared to both white men and white women! Another [study](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.848.1523&rep=rep1&type=pdf) found that even both male and female participants were equally likely as each other to be more willing to shoot a black unarmed suspect than a white female armed suspect or black female armed suspect. Men and women equally were likely (when not even looking at race) to prefer shooting unarmed male suspects over armed female suspects. An implicit racial bias [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/0146167219829182) found that black women were seen as more dangerous than white women by participants of all races, but they still viewed black men as more dangerous than black women. Even when looking at black children, they viewed black boys as more dangerous than black girls.\n\n**Black men had it worse during slavery**\n\nThis thread I made a year ago talks about how there were more male than female black people enslaved in the United States, and the black women were more likely to be free. In 19th century United States, [more men than women were slaves and more women than men were freed slaves](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1010277/black-and-slave-population-us-by-gender/). Although there was always a difference, the difference increased in the Civil War because of all the black male soldiers who died, and women weren't sent off to war as soldiers.\n\nThis only looks at the ones in the US. Believe it or not, the vast majority of enslaved black people were sent to places like South America or the Caribbeans, and a minuscule percentage were in the US. [When looking at all the enslaved black people from the 17th to 19th century](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1183869/ratio-male-female-slaves-by-route-1636-1867/), they found that in any region, men outnumbered women, with the gap being quite large in most regions. Many historians think all slave owners were white men, but evidence found that 40% were white women. They were often cruel and violent just like male slave owners. In fact, George Washington's wife owned way more enslaved people than him. White women were trained to enslave black people from a very young age, and they even were often given slaves as early as 9 months old! [According to](https://www.history.com/news/white-women-slaveowners-they-were-her-property) History.com:\n\n>White women were active and violent participants in the slave market. They bought, sold, managed and sought the return of enslaved people, in whom they had a vested economic interest. Owning a large number of enslaved people made a woman a better marriage prospect. Once married, white women fought in courts to preserve their legal ownership over enslaved people (as opposed to their husband’s ownership), and often won. “For them, slavery was their freedom,” Jones-Rogers observes in her book.\n\n**Black men were raped, too.**\n\nWe often hear about female slaves being raped, and how it was legal to rape black women. [What we don't hear about is how often black men were raped by slave owners](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/448992/pdf). [They often were](https://shareok.org/handle/11244.46/1279). They also were stripped naked and white people laughed at their genitals (i.e.: body shaming of men for their penis size even though they have no control or choice of their penis size). According to the [AAIHS](https://www.aaihs.org/sexual-violence-against-enslaved-men/),\n\n>Foster begins *Rethinking Rufus* by examining how enslaved men’s bodies were depicted in Western art and sculptures that were widespread in the visual culture of slavery. Foster argues that enslaved men’s bodies were “symbols of enslaved manhood and sites of violation” that were objectified through a number of cultural forms including art and literature (12). The objectification of enslaved men depicted in paintings often resembled everyday acts of terror including the public inspection of Black men’s genitals, whippings and lashings, and bodily exposure due to lack of adequate clothing. Visual depictions of enslaved men that emphasized their genitalia and sexual prowess gave way to the prevailing myths of Black hypersexuality and the Black male rapist, an archetype that ensured the extralegal protection of white women from Black men who purportedly lacked control over their sexual urges. Foster also argues that while visual depictions of enslaved men’s bodies often highlighted their athleticism, strength, and muscularity, this same imagery eroticized enslaved men’s bodies in ways that fueled the physical abuses and sexual exploitation of enslaved men. Foster notes that these stereotypes found in eighteenth-century visual art contributed to the eventual punishment and national disenfranchisement of Black men.\n\n**White women also raped or sexually preyed on black men, too.**\n\n[White women also had sexually abused black men, too](http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1674/sexual-relations-between-elite-white-women-and-enslaved-men-in-the-antebellum-south-a-socio-historical-analysis). White women were authority figures or in a position of power over these black men, and white women had sex with black men, often even raping them forcibly. White women also threatened to falsely accuse black men of rape if black men didn't have sex with them. Because abortion was unregulated, and any woman was able to get an abortion back then, many white women used this advantage to sexually abuse black men without people knowing she fornicated out of wedlock, and was able to abortion \"illegitimate\" children, hiding the evidence that she sexually abused black men. As a result of this and the fact that men could not speak about being raped because people believe men cannot be raped, historical records of white women raping black men are often overlooked, and it could've been more common than we think, perhaps as common as white men raping enslaved black women.\n\n**Almost all lynching victims were men whereas a significant minority of victims were white.**\n\n[Another interesting fact](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5803482/lynching-nj-1901/): virtually all lynching victims were men. Of all the 2,516 lynchings that happened from 1885 to 1901 in the US, 82.67% happened in the South and 13.75% happened in the North. 66.69% were black and 31.84% were white. 97.97% were men and 2.03% were women. Just 51 women lynched compared to 2,465 men. We always hear about how most victims were black, but no information about how virtually all were men. White men got lynched far more than black women. Black women rarely were lynched, and almost no white women got lynched.\n\n**Black people also face discrimination when it comes to rape.**\n\nIt is true that people are less responsive to black women who got raped than white female rape victims, but if people knew how common it was for men to be raped, and women rape men as just as much as men rape women (cited in a thread I cited above about women being more likely to commit crime than people think), then I'm sure they'd respond less to black male rape victims than white male or black female rape victims. In fact, they'd probably care for black women who are raped than white men who raped. Black men also are viewed as hypersexual, promiscuous, unable to control sexual urges, and always wanting sexual intercourse.\n\nAlso, false accusations happen a lot more than feminists admit, and I cite evidence for it in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/xzb7d8/statistics_show_that_false_accusations_are_quite/) of mine, and black men especially are affected. Black prisoners incarcerated for rape are especially likely to be innocent, especially when their accuser is a white woman. White women historically falsely accused black men of rape to get them lynched, and they still falsely accuse them, and while most rapists get away with it, black men who are accused by white women are more likely to be incarcerated even if they're innocent. It was considered rape historically for black men to have consensual sexual intercourse with white women, and there was a double standard for a while where people judged black men marrying white women more harshly than white men marrying black women because black men were viewed as predatory.\n\n**Education/life expectancy**\n\nBlack women also have a higher life expectancy than white men and especially black men, and are less likely to go to college than white men but [go more than black men](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/black-women-are-earning-more-college-degrees-but-that-alone-wont-close-race-gaps/).\n\n**Feminists don't care about black people, not even black women.**\n\nFeminists often don't pay attention much to black women's struggles. Even first wave feminists disregarded them and didn't want them to vote, let alone allow black men to vote, and that motivated them and was a reason why they wanted to vote, because they worried black men were technically allowed to vote despite Jim Crow laws and didn't want them to have the complete ability to vote before white women.\n\nNonetheless, many stereotypes feminists make about men are especially applied to black men due to society historically portraying them as hypermasculine, hypersexual and prone to violence or crime. Feminists' portrayal of men harms black men especially. They also ignore false rape accusations despite that white women still, to this day, falsely accuse black men of rape which is why so many black prisoners are falsely incarcerated for rape, and yet feminists expect every reported person for rape to be imprisoned. They also widely ignore how black women are associated more with the term black than with women, and aren't viewed as normal women.\n\nThis is why womanism (black feminism) was started.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDoes anyone notice how people hate black men more than black women? Yeah black women face pregnancy discrimination with prenatal care and dealing with more abortions and unwanted pregnancies, but black men usually don't ever get to see their kids, and often cannot afford to pay child support. Many black children are raised by single moms and barely knew their dad, if at all.\n\nThe reason black men face more discrimination than black women is due to people's racism towards black people being associated with seeing them as a threat, not dislike, and being a woman prevents black women from being seen as a threat as much as black men. Nonetheless, people might see black women as more dangerous than white women and be racist towards them due to a guilt by association mindset. In spite of that, people still are more racist towards black men because when racial attitudes are mostly about feeling threatened, people tend to view women in general as harmless, which is different from how they view men in general.",

    "text": "Why does society keep making excuses for female bullying/abuse continuing to be accepted instead of being challenged? As a woman this is quite a double standard I am amazed by, obviously not trying to de-emphasize the very effect male bullying can have on receivers of both genders, but you can’t deny male bullying/abuse is by far more called out and readily united against than female bullying/abuse\n\nI will give an example so you can get a bit of a proper context\n\nExample #1 My son worked for Sam’s Club as a cart attendant,  when he first started he was interviewed and hired by a male pundit, and most of his management team consisted of men, as time went on he got hit with a new batch of managers and guess what? Most of the managers, were you guessed it, women, not even talking barely adult women, nah these were grown ass women in their mid 30s to almost 50s acting like a bunch of high school jocks with their recently given power, 2 of the team leads who were  black women, well they both ended up always harassing him every second and one even grabbed him by the wrist, I even went to lash out to one of the general managers, acting all stupid and not knowing what has happened, there was no reason to put hands on his wrist like that, I remember after he got fired he went thru a 3 month coma of depression and to this day this still lingers him\n\n\nYet nobody wanted to do shit about it because they were mostly an all female team\n\nBtw feminists what happened to that power fantasy that an all female environment would be more peaceful and welcoming? Yet the experience at Sam’s Club proved to me if anything all female environments are just as toxic as all male ones, if not even more. Full of nothing but gossip, micromanaging and even physical abuse\n\nAnother example: My sister(his aunt) is always very argumentative with him over nothing, she is literally the type of person who makes herself a professional victim with every counter she has, especially with him. One time she literally told him to go back to Mexico all because he was dissatisfied with his schooling situation, how dehumanizing do you have to be?\n\nSo yeah we’re not gonna move forward as a society if we keep excusing female bullying/abuse and it sure as shit ain’t gonna make feminism gain anymore respect among mainstream social discourse https://youtu.be/RibLBo6RPmM",

    "text": "Women did make lots of contributions to society, and it is feminists, not men, who erased that from historical records. In fact, people have always thought women before their period were oppressed. A feminist from the 1940s named Mary Beard wrote a book called *Woman as a Force in History*. It critiques the myth that women were historically treated as subordinate to men and they were restricted from contributing to society or having basic human rights. Her book only includes just a portion of what women contributed to in society, and she says there's so much more. She has no idea how it got erased from history, but critiques the idea that women were historically oppressed compared to men.\n\n**Women did have an education in medieval times.**\n\nFeminists like to think that women were denied an education historically because people hated them and wanted them to suffer, but that's false. In fact, in medieval times, women were being educated all the time, and were as literate as men. G. G. Coulton, the life-long student of mediaeval history, gives a cautious answer: “Though very few women arrived at anything like the university stage in education, it seems probable that more of them could read and write than the men,” especially in the upper classes “at the period when romances of adventure were offered in profusion.” Interestingly, going to university was less common back then.\n\nThis [chapter](https://www.marxists.org/archive/beard/woman-force/ch11.htm) from her book elaborates on all the education women had back long ago in medieval Europe. It was very normal for them to have an education. Italian and German women especially had the most education of the Middle Ages. You can see that women had education and high literacy rates, and were more literate than men. They succeeded a lot in education. Maybe there were some societies that normalized education for boys, but that's because in those societies, education taught discipline, not facts, and people believed girls were more well-behaved than boys and thus didn't need it. Moreover, corporal punishment was used on boys much more, and boys were subjected to forced labor. This was meant for build character and discipline in children. Women weren't educated because it was believed they were less prone to bad behavior and didn't need to be educated. There was only a small overlap between education becoming useful for learning things, and women not being allowed to be educated. Later on, corporal punishment and forced labor declined in schools. It was actually seen as unmanly for boys to be willing to learn.\n\nEven in the later 19th century, girls performed better than boys in elementary schools and outnumbered them, and even in the early 1900s, when high school became more common, girls went to high school more often. Girls even had free education whereas boys in high school had to have their parents pay a fee. You can read more about this from the book *The Privileged Sex*.\n\n**Women did build society and contribute to the social and economic realm of society.**\n\nIn [Chapter 10](https://www.marxists.org/archive/beard/woman-force/ch10.htm), Beard wrote:\n\n>AFTER the dissolution of the Roman Empire, nearly all the economic activities connected with the production of food, clothing, and shelter were carried on in rural villages and their outlying fields everywhere in Western Europe. Whether the village was a free community or property belonging to the estate of a great feudal lord or lady, it was largely self-sufficing; its inhabitants supplied nearly all their needs for the maintenance of life. Furthermore, the industries of households and fields were not like the modern “heavy industries.” Women could handle nearly all of them alone or with some aid from men.  \n>  \n>Thus there was no sharp division of labor as a rule. Men and women worked together for the most part. If the major responsibilities for spinning, weaving, and cooking were women’s tasks, if wood-cutting and ditching were generally men’s tasks, men and women commonly worked side by side in the fields and to a considerable extent in all the processes of transforming raw materials into commodities for use. Whether the toilers on the land were bond or free, men and women labored under similar conditions and enjoyed similar liberties of choice such as they were. Though women gave birth to the children, both parents had the services of children to help them in their work. In the records of mediaeval rural life that are available in our age, no specially onerous burdens are found to have been laid on women as women by men as men. On the contrary the records show a sharing of the toilsome tasks on about the same terms.\n\nWomen were also, even in the Indian and Middle Eastern regions, just as involved in gilds as men. Beard writes:\n\n>While in some of the records the details are lacking, Smith’s *English* Gilds contains accounts of the structure, membership, functions, and proceedings of about eighty-five gilds. In at least seventy-two of them women were members on an equal basis with men. That is surely a large proportion. In some of the other gilds a slight qualification was placed on widows; they were accepted if their husbands had been gild men. Lest the idea of sheer generosity or friendship for the deceased be adjudged the reason for admitting widows to gilds, let it be remembered that, in innumerable cases, widows carried on the craft in which their husbands had been active, being directly familiar with it as a household industry at which they had themselves labored or in connection with which they had borne responsibilities for training and directing apprentices.\n\nWomen were not in a segregated gild, and mixed gilds were common. Some men didn't approve of women in some gilds, but it wasn't due to hatred of women, but because they believed women weren't strong enough for things like bread-kneading and bread-baking. Nonetheless, these men didn't get the monopoly they looked for:\n\n>But a French Parlement refused to prohibit the customary baking by women and declined to back up the men’s opposition to the women. A French parliamentary decree even accorded some gild women rights frequently denied to English widows; it ruled that a widow could retain her membership in a gild even if she took as her second husband a man who did not work in her craft.\n\nWomen also were involved in all kinds of parts of society:\n\n>Just as women took part and carried full loads of work in agriculture, domestic industries, and trading, just as they participated in the activities of craft, trade, and social gilds or corporations, so they shared and expressed themselves in all the forms of social life in town and country. In everything human their qualities and force were expressed – from religious and secular festivities, sports, games, and riots to the **discussion of religious and moral questions and the management of charitable undertakings**. In castles and cottages, in fields and in gild halls, on village greens and in churchyards, in towns and on city streets, in taverns and at market fairs they sought release from the rigors of earning a livelihood, from burdens of domesticity, or responsibilities belonging to the status of their class, whatever it was.\n\nWhen knights even had tournaments to display prowess, it was often done to impress female spectators. **Women's cheers brought outlets in arguments over public, private or religious matters, and in disputes about property, trade, marriage arrangements, family problems, tastes, habits and good or bad manners**. In fact, in medieval times, women were very fierce in many cases, and they would steal husbands' money and run with monks, get in violent fights with women in arguments, smash knights with swords, drinking and singing in taverns, etc. One woman even bloodied a priest's nose after he tried to rape her. When the priest ordered to her to become a pilgrim to Rome, Thomas of Cantimpre laughed and advised to the woman that if a priest sexually assaults or inappropriately pursues her:\n\n>then thou smite him sore with thy clenched fist, even to the striking out, if possible, of his eye; and in this matter thou shalt spare no order of men, for it is as lawful for thee to strike in defense of thy chastity as to fight for thy life.\n\nIn medieval times, women were seen as sinful or wicked, resorting to magic, or the originators of sin, and in need to obey priests or obedient to their husbands, but men were seen as brutal or vulgar, and he had to love his wife, help her support the family and never harm her, and charivaris were done against him or even family intervention if he abused his wife. This was all a reaction to the aggression women engaged in then that people thought women would never do and that only men would do (and feminists reinforce this gender role by portraying all violent women as victims):\n\n>Also, repeated again and again and again in mediaeval documents was the idea that women had been better, if not ideal, “in the good old days,” but were now given to luxury, assertiveness, display, love of worldly goods and pleasures. Hence it would appear that the newest clichés are not so new after all.\n\nMen fought at wars more than women and committed crime more, but women who had power waged wars. Women assembled soldiers. Women fought side by side with men. Women were guilty of many cruelties, and women aided and approved the worst. Women conformed to no type, and they weren't \"tame\" in a \"man's world\". \n\n**Women had a lot of power in marriage and family that men had.**\n\nAccording to the same chapter, Beard wrote:\n\n>Beyond all question the weight of documentary evidence is against any simple conclusion that men handed women around like chattels; that boys were free to make their own choices of mates, while girls were helpless creatures at the disposition of men. After the rise of the centralized state, no one, male or female, was actually “free,” save perhaps the king or queen as highest lord, and even members of royal families had to be on guard against actions likely to stir up revolt among underlings. As a matter of fact, fathers and mothers of the middle and lower classes, as well as lords and ladies, took part in arranging the marriages of both boys and girls under the almost universal rule of “convenience.” The boy apparently had no more choice than the girl. There are records indicating that boys and girls sometimes made vigorous protests without avail; other records show that their protests were effective. But the general rule of marriage for convenience long prevailed.  \n>  \n>Whether fathers or mothers , men or women, usually dominated in the making of matches is a matter buried in the silence of unrecorded history, but there is abundant proof that women were active in the business and were no less circumspect or ruthless than men at the business. Women looked about for marriageable boys and girls to be convenient mates for girls and boys in their own families. Maidens were inclined to be shrewd and insistent – that is, “practical” – in marrying men with property, when they had any chance of selection, as they often did. Mothers were zealous in procuring for their daughters men who had property and in making sure that the property was good, and carefully guarded by proper legal titles. In other words, the marriage of convenience was no one-sided affair in which fathers and sons “had their own way” with the women concerned in it.\n\nAnd women still owned property. It's a myth they couldn't historically. They always were allowed to even back in antiquity. \n\n**Women were involved in warfare and building antiquity.**\n\n[According to chapter 12](https://www.marxists.org/archive/beard/woman-force/ch12.htm), German writer Sir Galahad described the ways of aggressive women long ago. Proof of armed women was found in European ancient ruins, proving that Amazons, the Greek female warriors, were real. Some people think early human years were peaceful, but fights broke out and disrupted it, and women were active in these conflicts in every way men were:\n\n>Where they had power as rulers or in ruling families they often instigated and proclaimed wars and even marshaled their troops as they went into battle. They incited men to ferocity at the fighting fronts. They accompanied men on marauding expeditions. They fought in the ranks. They took up arms to defend their homes. They nursed men on battle fronts or kept households going while men were at battle, and they looked after the wounded on their return to civilian life.  \n>  \n>There was not a type of war in which women did not participate. They were among the primitive hordes which went on looting expeditions against their neighbors or stood fast on their own ground in defense of their lives, herds, and fields. Old Roman records testify to the savagery of women in the Cimbrian tribes that swept down from the north into Rome. Among the Cimbrians, priestesses took charge of war captives. Standing on ladders which they carried with them to battle, they cut off the heads of prisoners, caught the blood in pots, and gave it to their men to drink, in the belief that it would double their strength.\n\nAncient women also initiated or inspired military efforts to subjugate others. Alexander the Great's militant Epirote mother, \"a priestess to whom his father, Philip, had been attracted when he saw her as a maiden prancing to or from a temple with a snake, a god symbol, held high in her arms, and attended by a procession of other maidens\", drove Alexander to become the master of the world. In most of Europe in antiquity and even during Arabia when Islam spread and people declared war against the Muslims, women fought at war. Even Muhammad had his female warriors who teamed up with him.\n\n**Women did influence politics, economics and social change historically.**\n\nFeminists argue women were forbidden from politics. Not exactly. While people were serving in the government were men in many societies, it's because they believed those who fought for our country were the ones allowed to form the government, but not all societies only sent women to war. [In fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_suffrage#Dates_by_country), in almost all countries, originally, neither men nor women could vote, and they usually granted suffrage to both concurrently. In some countries, they originally granted it men, then later women. In the US and UK, men originally could only vote if they owned property, and only 3% of British men and 6% of American men did (women were never property). In 1828 during the presidential election, the vast majority of states gave all men the right to vote, but it wasn't in all states until universal white male suffrage was given to men in North Carolina in 1856. Later on, women were given the right to vote more and more. It was simply because men served in the military in the US back then, not because women were considered inferior.\n\nNonetheless, women DID influence politics historically. Not voting didn't stop this, [and many women were originally against the right to vote](https://www.societyforhistoryeducation.org/pdfs/M15_Miller.pdf) because they worried it'd take away their soft power in influencing politics. In fact, many men supported their right to vote for equality, and while people who supported women's suffrage thought it was unfair they couldn't vote, people who opposed it worried that women had more power influencing politics than men because the government responded to women's needs more while men just cast in a vote that only wins if it's the majority opinion. Susan B. Anthony said women's suffrage laws \"probably never would have passed if it had been up to women to vote on them,\" and that men were actually more progressive about women’s suffrage than women were (1902). This [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/15ac3xy/women_did_influence_politics_before_suffrage_and/) of mine elaborates on how women influenced politics easily before voting.\n\nContrary to what feminists think, laws weren't created based strictly on the opinions of men. Only 1% of men worked for the government, and they usually made laws based on what they thought was best for the land or its people, but not for men. Totalitarian leaders might be all about themselves, but certainly not men either. Women's opinions mattered a lot to men. [In fact](https://presidentlincoln.illinois.gov/Blog/Posts/141/Abraham-Lincoln/2021/8/Lincolns-avoided-duel/blog-post/), [Abraham Lincoln](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/abraham-lincolns-duel) even used female pen names pretending to be a woman to attack political rivals, including James Shields.\n\nAlongside speaking against recent policy decisions made by Shields, Lincoln implied that his opponent was weird and unpopular with women.\n\n>*\"His very features, in the ecstatic agony of his soul, spoke audibly and distinctly – 'Dear girls, it is distressing, but I cannot marry you all. Too well I know how much you suffer; but do, do remember, it is not my fault that I am so handsome and so interesting.’”* \\-- Rebecca (Abraham Lincoln)\n\nLincoln's wife also wrote several letters against Shield under a female penname. Lincoln apparently consulted with her about his letters to make them sound like a woman wrote them. What does this mean? Women were seen as pure and moral compared to men, so their voices mattered a lot in politics, and because they couldn't vote, they were seen as fair and reasonable. **This is why women often opposed the right to vote, because they worried it would prevent them from being influential in politics.** If the 1800s were so patriarchal, why would he have used a female penname to pretend that a man was unpopular with women to destroy that man's career?\n\n[Moreover](https://daily.jstor.org/women-against-womens-suffrage/), Catharine Beecher, an advocate for women’s education and economic advancement, argued that women were most effective when they united to press their fathers, brothers, and husbands for reforms in terms that rose above intense partisan politics. Using anecdotal evidence, she pointed to her sister, Harriet Beecher Stowe, whose [*Uncle Tom’s Cabin*](https://daily.jstor.org/frederick-douglass-feud-over-uncle-toms-cabin/) had contributed to anti-slavery sentiment in the country, selling quickly before the Civil War and humanizing enslaved black people. It changed American's views of enslavement at the time, especially in the North. Another example was the women’s clubs that fought for pure food laws, [compulsory schooling](https://daily.jstor.org/why-would-parents-oppose-compulsory-education/), and other reforms that were easily framed in terms of maternal care.\n\n[Women influenced politics in many other ways, too](https://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/5-ways-women-influenced-politics-they-got-vote). In the 1800s, men and women flirted at political rallies and met their potential spouse. Politically-charged women charmed men into supporting certain political views, especially first-time male voters. In his new book *The Virgin Vote*, Smithsonian political history curator Jon Grinspan explains that women even \"turned down marriage proposals specifically because of a young man's political affiliations.\" These actions pressured husbands and suitors to vote in favor of a woman's views.\n\nCarry Nation, a female leader in the Temperance movement, used to use hatchets to smash saloons. Churches and theaters paid her to against alcohol. In the Victorian era, if a man smashed alcohols, he'd be stabbed, but men were chivalrous towards women and refused to harm her. Many people laughed at her, but respected her integrity for her beliefs anyway. Carry's radical approach helped launch the Temperance movement into mainstream American politics.\n\nEven in medieval times, women teamed up with Prophet Muhammad to fight off aggressors against Muslims and helped spread the message of Islam. Women in medieval Europe brought discussions and disputes about moral, societal, or religious issues.\n\nWhen wars happened over the centuries, wars of conquest, defense, crusades, or self-defense did not exclude women. As long as the Eastern Empire lasted, women were involved in situations that led to war. As the empire declined and feudal wars happened for imperialism, women in aristocracies and royal families inspired and initiated wars, and sometimes used their own weapons. They built the state of Western worlds which turned local conflicts into global wars, assisted by women. For centuries in the West and East, imperial power only was ostensibly (but not exactly so) bestowed to men who were head of a family. In reality, official or not, his power was shared by women. Imperial power was often exercised by one or more women. Even in Ancient Rome, the state had lots of power among its women. Beard cited:\n\n>Among such studies of ancient Rome are the 1,124 pages of the old work by J. R. de Serviez, *Roman Empresses ... Wives of the Twelve Caesars,* first published in the eighteenth century – an age of despotism in Europe; and G. Ferrero’s *Women of the Caesars,* published in 1911 when the power of European family clans was rapidly dissolving.\n\nOther wars/conflicts, like the Renaissance, the restoration of the Bourbons, War of the Spanish Succession, War of the Austrian Succession. As medieval Europe was developing, in rural families, men and women worked together almost consistently, and the woman kept the family and its land and house economy going while husbands went to war in England. In royal and aristocratic families in England, women used force in the state of affairs and in the management of the economy helping the monarchy. It wasn't until the the 18th century in England during revolutions destroying the royal/aristocratic families founded on wealth did women and their families in these groups lose power and the parliament and government became solely men. As time went by men, men were the ones serving in military, and they decided men thus would be the ones allowed in the government, but women had soft power in influencing politics as mentioned earlier, which is why people worried giving them the right to vote would get rid of that subtle power. This change happened especially in the French Revolution. In the 1800s, more and more women suffragists were appearing, but men also struggled with the right to vote beside the low minority who had property and thus qualified. In the most progressive societies, women received the right to vote before men's universal suffrage appeared in other societies. Before this point, there were women were highly involved in royal/aristocratic power over influencing politics and society. \n\n[Up until a couple centuries ago](https://www.cracked.com/article_20186_6-ridiculous-myths-about-middle-ages-everyone-believes.html), Europe was agricultural. In medieval Europe, if a father was owning a shop or tavern, his daughters were the ones helping. If her dad became unable to, she sometimes took over the business herself if he was now unable to, which didn't really happen until later in modern times. Women also generally ran taverns in medieval Europe, and [women in England ran the entire beer industry back then](https://books.google.com/books?id=c6MQJ-pdbwAC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false). Women who didn't run taverns or grow crops often joined convents, and when education was rare at the time, it gave these women access to education. Thus, nuns could read or write in an era where the most powerful kings couldn't. [If women could eventually rule of a house of nuns, they could reach position of power very similar to a male lord, or even slightly higher, seeing as how they technically reported directly to the King of Kings and whatnot](https://web.archive.org/web/20100215224014/http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/medieval/women2/medievalwomen.html). Sometimes, in monasteries, the abbess had seniority over monks. Outside monastic walls, women could wield political power, especially as queens and regents who exercised royal authority when their husband or underage son was unavailable. A number of powerful queens can be noted in English history, of whom one of the most remarkable was Queen Isabella (1295-1358), who (in collaboration with her lover, Sir Robert Mortimer) ended the rule of her husband, Edward II (1284-1327).\n\n[Even in the Middle East](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1525/ae.1974.1.3.02a00100), women DO influence politics and society. They do it from private positions, and exercise influence over men, by being mediators in natal or affinal groups in marriage alliances, wielders of authority in the domestic sphere, educating their children, or controlling products or property. Women form kinship groups, act as \"data brokers\", mediating social relations in family and society. Women also notify men in their household about what happens in other homes and in extended family. Women also, despite being segregated by sex at times, join with other women in forming solidarity groups and spreading social influence. It helps cause political influence and raises her social status. Women also can influence men's behavior by spreading rumors or gossip, writing mock songs, and spreading social influence to boost or ruin his reputation, especially in social and political issues. Women there might not be in the government, but men rarely make it in the government, and women have so much widely ignored soft power in influencing society and politics, but feminists don't realize in some countries where dictatorships occur, they won't always get what they want, but some of the women's opinions there ARE socially conservative. Women there do influence how people think there and eventually these countries will lose their social norms if people figure their way around their countries' domineering government.\n\nWe have laws pandering to women, including battered women's shelters, campaigns and organizations for women's health, laws against violence against women, etc, but while these politicians are men, they don't make these laws for men. People have always responded to women's soft power historically and politicians' success depended on his support from women more than from men. Men weren't always able to vote historically, but when men served in the military more, they were given the right to vote, but women were still granted soft power that made more changes than mere marks on ballots that only won if a majority. That's why suffragists were originally a minority, but still managed to spread enough influence to become a majority.\n\n**Women were not excluded from history from men, but by feminists.**\n\nIn Chapter 12, Mary Beard wrote:\n\n>Certainly the original sources, which scholars use for the study of men in long and universal history, often mention and even recount stories or give elaborate data of many kinds about women. For example, Herodotus, whom historians of the modern age have called “the father of history,” deliberately included women in his history. Tacitus, the Roman, also observed and commented on the women of his time. Indeed ancient writers in various societies often thought it necessary to consider women and among their works are to be found statements respecting women’s force of character, learning, physical energy, military and political power, and creative intelligence – statements made by the contemporaries of such women.\n\nSo obviously, writers and historians didn't exclude women and even wanted them included. Mary Beard wrote in her book that the idea that women were men's subordinates and were forbidden from contributing to society is one of the biggest myths told in history. Feminists have erased the fact that 40% of slave owners in the US were white women and that women had soft power or even before the 1700s, had royal and aristocratic power, and promoted myths that women were property, were expected to be asexual beings even in marriage, were allowed to be beaten/raped by their husband, or were violently hated. Feminists probably originally removed women's contributions to society from history. Then decades later, feminists wanted to educate society about women's contributions to society they claimed were erased by men because they are clueless about what the first wave feminists did.",

    "text": "Another Deep Barbie Movie Review with philosophical breakdown ## Ladies, there are some great chick flicks.\n\n**My favorite chick flicks in no particular order:** *My Best Friend’s Wedding, Clueless, Fried Green Tomatoes, 10 Things I Hate About You, Pretty Woman, The Devil Wears Prada, Practical Magic, When Harry Met Sally, Bridesmaids, Grease, Sleepless in Seattle, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Sixteen Candles, Love Jones, Titanic,*…probably more I can think of. So, you know where I am coming from. Do *Aliens* and *Kill Bill* Count?\n\nI loved *Lady Bird*. ***Greta Gerwig*** is undeniably talented. I think the leap from more independent to big budgets created some new money problems. Following the zeitgeist of popular opinion hurt the artistic merits the film could have brought.\n\nOutside of my disagreements with some of the social messaging, I think it was average and missed some connective tissue that could have made it a classic chick flick.\n\n## Why is it average?\n\nIt’s a big budget average, in the sense that it’s trying to appeal to a large audience. You have to do your best to find the center of the line of appeal to your target audience. Not that that’s men. Young women are the highest purchasing demographic. Make a project that most women can agree on. Easy enough.\n\nIt was clunky in a way where ideas or locations or changes in story were not unfolding smoothly. For Example:\n\n* Ken beginning to change and rule Barbie Land.\n* The walk at the end with Ruth.\n* The world or rules of Barbie Land.\n* Barbie just barks out about death for no reason. *I get it was intentional but still…*\n\nI gave it a personal C or C+. My better half gave it a 7 out of 10, she won’t be watching again. Initially, I was open to it. I had heard both positive and negative reviews, so I was able to go in with neutrality.\n\n## So Many Unanswered Questions!\n\nConnective tissue was left unexplained.\n\n**Where are the scenes of the Barbies being brainwashed?** It’s interesting we never see any real manipulation of women. No outright lies. But, we do see it from our protagonists.\n\n**Did Barbie choose to become human?** **Did she decide to have genitals?** How much self knowledge do they have?\n\n**Where did Ruth and Barbie walk to when they had their little chat? Could there have been some kind of magical cloud that circled them?** They just walked somewhere unnecessarily. **Why wasn’t it just in Barbie Land?**\n\n**Again! What are the rules of Barbie Land?**\n\n**Are there other Barbie lands like parallel universes?** **If so, what happens to the barbie that a dog got a hold of?** **Or a Barbie flew out the car window? Is there a B.C.U.? A Barbie Cinematic Universe?**\n\n**What happened to that box of Barbies that mom threw away? Were they sentient and died?**\n\nAnswering these questions could have made for some entertaining scenes, accessible to all audiences.\n\nIn an independent you can let some things go and leave it to artistic, personal, subjective decisions/opinions. With bigger projects you have to make the spectacle large, to hide the magic tricks. I think it needed more gloss or rouge. **Am I getting the makeup terminology right?** Rouge? I’m a dude.\n\n## Hero’s Journey or Satire?\n\nCan Barbie be herself if she doesn’t want to join the real world? The message seems to be don’t be a doll, be more, join the real world. Her becoming real could have been a cathartic resolution to something she’s always wanted. Like Ariel in the *Little Mermaid* animation getting to be part of our world.\n\nIt was a **nice ending** to not give her a specific life or career direction.\n\nBut, I found it *satire-lite*. Non offensive nor thought provoking to the target audience. An echo chamber. When it comes to the actual message there was an opportunity to talk about what equality actually means; showing how Barbie Land could become a place of true equality affecting the real world.\n\nMaybe we don’t want to do that.\n\nCould there be more nuance to the 2-dimensional Barbie Land to the real world where an average guy doesn’t just slap Barbie on the butt, in front of her boyfriend? If they wanted to paint both worlds as 2-dimensional I wish they had leaned more into it. Enhance how black and white our world is.\n\n## His Story.\n\nOkay. This movie is not about Ken.\n\nKen came back to share information about Barbie and news about the real world. When and how did that message change? It seems like Ken should have been the main villain.\n\nMake him a great villain with a real philosophy, you can understand, like Joker in The Dark Knight or Thanos. It doesn’t even need to be that deep. Ken could have had a rant about patriarchy being power and hypnotized everybody. We could see the middle of his thirst for power. Connective tissue.\n\nThey used Ken’s love and attraction to the Barbies to make them jealous and physically attack each other and control everything, like a matriarchy. But, there was no irony or disagreement. This is how to operate? This is the message? Rule everything and you can do anything you want to do.\n\nHave you seen that movie where men say they don’t need women and we can do everything on our own? That movie is out there somewhere. I don’t but I’m looking.\n\n## Shafts of Light in the Pinkness\n\nNot that it was all rainbows and no beer.\n\nTwo of great points, aside from Ken’s awesome songs:\n\n* the arch of Ken and Barbie’s relationship seeing him as a human being. This could be a message for the male audience? Although, he adores her and she doesn’t respect him.\n* the rant that “pulled Barbie out of it.” The plot changing rant really could have applied to both men and women. There were bits and pieces that were tailored. But, both men and women have to traverse dual roads in life, especially when leading. Be nice and stern. Handle the stress and smile. That applies to anyone working towards a high position and has bosses and/or people to manage.\n\nThis film could have been a great opportunity to show a unity not apparent to the “real world.” Could Barbies have affected real world change?\n\nIs the point to show the hypocrisy of the Barbie world as just the opposite of the real world? If so, that could have landed better, maybe with a joke.\n\nBut, it’s Barbie land and it can’t be equal. Right? It belongs to Barbie.\n\nWhich is the problem.\n\nYou can’t make half a satire.\n\n# Æ\n\n&#x200B;",

    "text": "My boss thinks white men are more competent. She's a middle aged white woman too.  I'm a white passing Mexican young woman.\n\nI got my white boyfriend a job working with me in a corporate type office job. The issue is that my boss gives my bf all the opportunities that I feel should be given to me. Mostly because I have not only already performed the work when they needed and made award winning improvements. I proven my competence many times over and had to work way harder than my boyfriend to get half as much. \n\nIt's like my boss has us switched around in her head. Like she thinks all the work I've done was actually done by my boyfriend. Everything I've wanted she's given to him. The position he was promoted to, that I thought I was a shoe in for, has exclusively been held by white men. \n\nI was actually the first Hispanic female in her department to have ever been promoted from hourly to salary. The company has existed since the 80's and she's been in the department for 20 years. And she did everything to prevent my promotion, going so far as to make a position just for me which was the same work plus my previous position for 3/4 of the wages paid.  \n\nShe chooses to have a less productive and competent person do the task because she believes white men are unequivocally more competent. The black men and Hispanic team members have also been passed over on ALL opportunities in favor of less experienced white men. We're the only minorities in the department btw. \n\nAnd she always insists on working with the white men in our department, even going as far as re-writing the job description to work under her instead of the actual managers. It's creepy, but I never disclosed the employee I recommended is also my boyfriend. \n\nI know this job isn't forever, but I just needed to vent. Me & the bf are good, it's not his fault that he benefits from a white patriarchal society while I suffer.",
