    "text": "Is it a good idea to message the CEO? So there’s this company that I’ve been really wanting to work with. I have already had two interviews done with them previously for two different positions: Admin Sales and Account Manager. \n\nThe hiring for the Admin Sales position was put on hold after my first interview until next year, and so I requested the recruiter to interview me for the position of Account Manager as it really matched with my profile. \n\nAfter a month, I was interviewed for the Account Manager position. My first interview went pretty well, but since it was a replacement position, they needed a fluent Arabic speaker to maintain the team balance. And so I was not selected. \n\nNow the Account Manager position has reopened. I am thinking of messaging the CEO on LinkedIn, explaining him my story and how much I’m willing to join the company, and possibly pass a word to the recruitment team so I can have a strong backing.  \n\nI’m still confused about this approach. Do you think it would work out?",
