    "text": "New Principal Worries and a Rant We have a new principal. This is a regular occurrence at our school. I have very little faith in principals in general - they often cause more problems for teachers than they solve in my experience. \n\nListening to new principal's first speech, three things were very strongly implied:\n\n1) New principal believes that teachers working extra long hours beyond contract time is just how it is because teaching is a calling (one that the principal was called to then moved on to admin, hmm...) \"no excuses\" \"just get it done\" \"teachers lose a lot of family time\"\n\n2) New principal is very religious and says god called them to our school (we are a public school) and they believe this means they will be the one to fix us \n\n3) New principal seems to believe that our issues will be solved with more accountability, \"proof\" \"evidence\" and \"data\" to show we are doing our jobs, and \"cultural awareness training\". \n\nNone of the above makes me more confident that this is going to be a good, or even better year than the last. I do not appreciate being told that teachers \"just know\" we don't get paid for all the hours we work, or that we had better be able to prove we are making the school a better place, or that my professional job is a semi-religious calling, or that we're probably being racist when we write referrals (implied, not explicitly said) because our data shows that in our 60/40 split white/minority school that white kids get less referrals (but still a large amount!). \n\nBe warned - the rest of this is a rant on the last point. \n\nOur school lines are drawn around an affluent neighborhood of mostly white kids, and a large swath of underprivileged neighborhoods of black and hispanic families. The poor white neighborhood in our district is on a line that is split with a neighboring school district, so our white student population is skewed to the well-off families, with two parent households, a stay-at-home parent, a lot of family support, and less behavior issues (I was honestly surprised, given this fact, that our white rate of referrals was as high as reported). I've also worked in a school district that was at least 90% white, mostly poor kids, and they had the same behavior issues, because most of it is a childhood trauma and poverty issue, NOT an issue of teachers wanting to write up the black and brown kids, or ignoring bad behavior of white kids. No teacher likes writing referrals, and everyone I know avoids it at all costs! But at a certain point, you have to remove the kid that is keeping everyone else from learning and causing a disruption, or cursing you out, or flat out refusing to follow a rule (for example, taking a video call in the middle of a class discussion and when told to put up the phone, talking louder, and telling the person on the other end how stupid the teacher is). \n\nIt is not our faculty's fault our school lines are drawn in a way that highlights the racial divides in our city, especially in the data related to behavior issues and grades. There are plenty of poor white kids who are friends with black and hispanic kids, but apparently they don't exist. Today I was told the white and black kids in my school don't associate with each other, despite seeing plenty of evidence with my own eyes to the contrary in my classes. The divide is mostly socioeconomic, and yes, many of the rich white kids aren't friends with the poor kids, many of whom are not white. However, plenty of them are friends with the middle class and wealthier minority students - I see them walking through the halls with linked arms every day! \n\nAll this to say, I don't trust the new principal, and I am concerned the district is going to actually make morale and the school culture worse by the way they are addressing racial issues in our school. It's one thing to remind teachers to be careful that they are not favoring or appearing to favor one racial group over another in discipline, in classroom cultural references, historical references, and to strive for equal representation, etc. It's another to ignore how racism over decades has shaped our community into socioeconomic and racial divides, and blame data that looks bad on teachers being racist.",

    "text": "Emerging Teacher of The Year Nominee Good morning from your potential Emerging Teacher of The Year! \n\nLast week I was told by my principal that according to my test scores I should be on an improvement plan. \n\nLast week I was also told that due to my classroom performance and dedication to my students I had been nominated to be a finalist for the Emerging Teacher of the Year award for the entire county. \n\nSoooooo...? I'm feeling a little confused about my place in the classroom. \n\nAll I know is that I got to school early and when I ran into my bathroom to dismiss the stomach ache my coffee had caused I found brown stuff smeared all over the walls. \n\nHappy Monday! I'm going to go work on my lessons plans now.... they're late. 😂\n\nTOY or nah?",

    "text": "Omelet Production and the World's Finest Chocolate  \n\nDuring our Nutrition Break which is sandwiched between 2nd and 3rd  periods, a band student whom I didn’t know wandered into my culinary  classroom with a bright smile and a box of the “World’s Finest  Chocolate.” I would like to say at the outset that whoever came up with  the name for this product WAS A MARKETING GENIUS.\n\nWhile the finest chocolates in the world are arguably made by  Teuscher’s of Switzerland, Valhona’s of France, or Godiva of Belgium;  the Cook Chocolate Company of Chicago, Illinois side stepped the entire  issue of truth in advertising after launching the “The World's Finest Chocolate\"  division as a school fund raiser in 1949. The chocolate bars were a  huge hit. Since 1949 this company (which was renamed the World’s Finest  Chocolate in 1972 in honor of their most successful division) has sold  an astounding 6 billion chocolate bars. This averages out to over 85.7  million chocolate bars per year and has generated some $3.8 billion in  school fund raising efforts over the past 70 years.\n\nSince the name of the product is “World’s Finest Chocolate,” the  company can legally argue that they’re not actually claiming to produce  the world’s finest chocolate because their name is really just a name.  As Juliet said in Shakespeare’s play, “*What’s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet*.”  In this case I would argue, that this name has at least in part, helped  to turn what had been a small chocolate making company into a  multi-billion dollar behemoth.\n\n“Would  you like to buy a chocolate?” asked the student who suggestively  waggled a chocolate bar in my direction. “They’re just $1.00.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m663dfayjet31.png?width=276&format=png&auto=webp&s=956f8eb019895f82f73bff0855a19262d4714386\n\n“Alright, I’ll take one. Do you have change for a $10.00 bill?”\n\nThe student’s face fell. “I don’t have any change.” He put the candy bar back in the box. “Thanks anyway.”\n\n“Now hold on,” I called. I looked in my wallet and pulled out a $10 bill.  \n “I’ll take 10 almond chocolate bars.”\n\nThe kid beamed. “You’re my first sale of the day!”\n\nAfter devouring one candy bar, I set the remaining nine aside. \n\nWhen 3rd period started, the 8th graders learned how to make a two  egg cheese omelet by watching a video. In the video they saw a chef pour  two scrambled eggs into a hot greased pan. As the eggs cooked, he  pushed the cooked eggs inwards and tilted the pan to allow raw eggs to  flow into the vacated space. As the eggs cooked further, he began  lifting the edge of the omelet and tilting the pan so that the raw eggs  would flow underneath the cooked section. When the eggs wouldn’t flow  anymore, he added cheese to one side and folded the omelet over.\n\nTwo of the fourteen 8th grade students who were in the kitchen were  able to produce a perfectly yellow omelet. Pictured below is one of the  8th grade products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c97vjzh1ket31.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c36cb8c7102baab8a3d8e489190312afd72d47b\n\nThe rest of the omelets varied from being slightly brown to being  more brown than yellow. To reward the two best omelet makers, I gave  each student a chocolate bar after confirming that neither had a nut  allergy.\n\nWith 20 students, 4th period is my largest class. Since Culinary I is  also working on breakfast foods, I did the same thing with them that I   had done with the 8th grade class. I talked to them about what we would  be doing and showed them a video.\n\nBefore going into the kitchen, I asked if there were any questions.\n\n“That looks really hard,” complained one of the freshmen.\n\n“Dibs on not being first!”\n\nSince the 4th period class seemed stressed about making  omelets (unlike the 8th grade students who have never failed to meet a  culinary challenge), I decided to offer a sweet incentive.\n\n“I have seven chocolate bars,” I announced to the class. “The first  SEVEN students who show me a PERFECTLY YELLOW OMELET” may have a candy  bar provided you’re not allergic to nuts.”\n\nThe arguments over who had to go first suddenly shifted.\n\n“DIBS ON BEING FIRST!”\n\n“Hey, I had dibs on being first!”\n\n“But you just said ‘dibs on being last!'”\n\n“Well  I MEANT that I wanted to be first.”\n\n“But that’s not what you said!”\n\n“But that’s what I meant!”\n\nThe students argued as they made a concerted rush for the kitchen.  Since possession is arguably 9/10ths of the law, five students settled  the argument as to who would be first by being the first to get to their  stations and being the first to lay their hands possessively over their  station’s saute pan.\n\n“REMEMBER!” I called. “I WANT PERFECTLY YELLOW OMELETS!”\n\n“YES CHEF!” chorused the students.\n\nWithin 5 minutes, the first student cook came up to me beaming with a  gorgeously yellow omelet. “I  HAVE A WINNER!” I announced as I handed  over a chocolate bar. “I HAVE SIX CHOCOLATES LEFT!”\n\nThe students collectively groaned because with 20 students in the  class and only six chocolate bars left, there was no way that everyone  would be able to earn a treat.\n\nAs it was, some students browned their omelets. I could see how  disappointed they were as they trudged to the back of the kitchen to  douse their omelets under ketchup or a spicy sriracha sauce.\n\nTen students (half of the entire class) were ultimately successful.  Since I only had chocolate bars for seven students, I rewarded the last  three by breaking into my secret stash of honey buns and fruit pies that  I keep as special incentives or the occasional birthday present.  While  not as exciting as a chocolate bar, I think the students were happy to  have been recognized for their efforts.\n\nI shared this experience with the faculty at a meeting that was held later on in the day.\n\n“And the moral to this story is to help the band by buying candy bars  to use as incentives!” beamed the principal as my colleagues laughed.\n\nThe band teacher obligingly stood up holding a box of the World’s  Finest Chocolate.  I left before she could offer me any since I’m  apparently a soft touch when it comes to buying chocolate.\n\nI will have to remember to start keeping single dollar bills in my wallet.\n\n(sigh)",

    "text": "Observing at my new school Good day to you!\n\nTwo days ago, I went to a job fair, got called back to interview, then got a letter of intent for a dual-language teaching position in the school district I've wanted since I graduated. I'm excited, but nervous. My academic Spanish is good, but not great - and I told my future principal that during the interview (I know...), But I have plans to work on that during the summer in addition to boning up on ESL techniques that I haven't discussed or used (I think) since college (8 years ago).\n\nMy thing is, I like to over-prepare (family thinks I'm crazy, but /shrug). So, I want to email my future principal to ask if I could come to the campus to observe-I want to get a feel for the school, you know? In my current position, I have Fridays off, so I wouldn't be taking away from my current students & it's essentially my time, but....\n\nI wonder if it's weird to ask? My current principal says I should (and that she wished people would do that), but I'm just not sure. What do you think? \n\nTo be clear, I know my future colleagues will think I'm brown-nosing, but frankly, idc because I may as well start as I mean to go forward and I'm one of those annoying goody-two-shoes people who generally follows the rules. And anyone who knows me will tell you, I don't play games - I'm pretty blunt, so I have to work hard at not coming across as an asshole with adults (kids I don't have trouble with).\n\nSummary - I want to observe at my new school, but I think it might come off as weird to ask my new principal. What do you think?",

    "text": "Need advice! I have an internship interview in a few days with an international school:C Hello there teaching professionals of Reddit!\n\nI need advice urgently; - ; I'm a final year student pursuing a degree in education. Part of my course requires me to fulfill an internship at a school for 90 days teaching primary level students. I sent in my cover letter and resume to a few schools, and I got shortlisted for an interview with this one international school. The interview is in 2 days. Problem is, I have pink hair. I'm really worried. Do you think the principal will mind and will it hurt my chances of getting accepted? The internship will start in February probably but I'm planning to dye my hair back to brown before then to keep things \"professional\". But as of now I'm really nervous and I don't know what to do.. I'd be really grateful if you could share your opinions or any input regarding this matter! You could just help me get accepted!\n\nWith respect,  \nA clueless education student",
