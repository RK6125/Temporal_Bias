    "text": "So I just started a new job and was told I “look unprofessional” and should “put makeup on” So I recently got hired to work as a front desk coordinator at a clinic in Miami (I won’t mention the company’s name for obvious reasons.) When I went in for my second interview I noticed that a girl I knew from high school worked there (remember this.) I would be filling in her position because she is going to be moving to a higher position. \n\n I just finished my first official week today, I feel like overall I learned a lot and I was asking questions and being really attentive since its my first time working at a clinic. The girl I knew from high school helped me at the beginning, but then she kinda took a step back, for example today I was on the phone with a patient and she took the phone from me in the middle of the conversation and took over. \n\n Like around 2pm in the middle of my shift today my manager calls me into her office and I really thought it was just to ask me how my first week went, but when I walked in she told me to close the door which was a bad sign. I sit down and she starts off by asking how I’ve been doing and if I learned how the system if I was understanding it. I said yes and I told her I liked working there she then proceeded to tell me how she’s been monitoring me since I’m in the 60 day probationary period and she’s noticed some things. She says she’s been noticing that I just sit there and don’t really try at all, how I don’t look as if I want to learn or to help and she went in about how she can let me go any time since I’m new. After that she continued saying how I dress really unprofessional and that I should be more like the girl I knew from high school. Mind you guys I haven’t gotten my uniform she ordered because it takes four weeks for it to get to the clinic. She continued talking about my clothes and how I should be wearing “clean pants” to work and I shouldn’t wear black jeans (I didn’t have enough money to buy dress pants so I wore black jeans.) She then mentions my hair, how I should try brushing it or try putting it in a ponytail or maybe I should try wearing makeup to look more “professional.” Since my first job experiences were in fast food restaurants she told me that this isn’t a McDonalds that now I’m in a real job and should dress like it. \n\nAfter our little talk I went back to my desk and couldn’t really believe what she just said, I was overwhelmed so I went to the bathroom and cried. I felt so useless and really confused and uncomfortable. I was really content at first because I wasn’t working for like six months, I don’t even know if I want to go back to work. What should I do?",

    "text": "My coworkers got 50-200% more stock options than I did even though we started at the same time Two of my coworkers at separate times (and unprompted by me) have mentioned how many stock options they received when we were all hired at the same time several years ago. Their numbers being so much greater than mine makes me realize how little my contribution is valued in relation to others on the team. I understand that different roles are valued differently but it still stings. Managers often tell me how valued I am because I am a hardworking, conscientious team player etc but those are just words. The promotions, stock options, and raises they give to some members of our team but not others tell the real story. I don’t know why I am having trouble processing this information since it is pretty black and white. I am attached to “the team” and genuinely like many of the people I work with, but to the company I am just a cog, to be used as cost efficiently as possible, and that shouldn’t surprise me.",

    "text": "8 months since being made redundant, multiple hundreds of applications since, i now have a job, and i start monday. It was a grueling experience. I have never been without work for this long. Previously, my longest period of being unemployed \\*willingly\\* (as in, not actively searching, taking a break) was about 3 months. This time, i got redundancy from a position and a management team i absolutely love. \n\nSince then, applying for roles i am absolutely perfect for. Getting really good feedback from interviewers. Being told in one of them \"i really see no reason why you wouldnt be perfect for the role\" amongst other things and then being told ive been unsuccessful. \n\nI landed a job with less pay than what im used to, but in an incredibly exciting industry that my skills transfer to absolutely fucking perfectly. I have a month probation/trial period, but from the sounds of it my manager is really looking to immediately integrate me deeply into the position. Already requesting if i can enroll in a specific course to assist him with specific tasks that are outside my scope, but i dont mind at all, as i will learn some absolutely fantastic things from it for my career growth.\n\nAs you know, things can look bright, and then crash hard at anytime, so im also well prepared to lose this job after a month of trial. You just never know. But, January has been a great month for me. for the 7 months before that, i had nothing. Just automated rejection emails. No calls, no interviews.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen this month, i start getting calls, interviews, and feedback and even if most of them didnt go nowhere, im confident now that im not in the black hole i was before. The 7 months were incredibly hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately my wife has just arrived to live with me from overseas and the timing is not great. She has at least had interviews and calls, but they have all being unsuccessful. I need to be strong for her too. It breaks my heart seeing her disheartened. She also has had a lot of luck landing jobs in her field in her home country but now, here, its going to be harder i know, since she is just newly permanent to the country, and with covid, the job market is so shit right now with competition. I told her, we will be fine. But she broke down and said \"i want to contribute so badly, i want to feel like im worth it\" it broke my fucking heart. But shes better now. after a long talk and a read through this thread, she knows, shes not alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share some positivity. I had never felt so low in my entire life before outside of that period where i felt like i was sending my intentions into the nether and getting nothing back. Im glad that for now, ill always remember, for the most part, perseverance pays off.",

    "text": "From \"We're Definitely Going to Move Forward With You\" to \"We Found Someone Else, Sorry\"-It Really Feels Like No One in the Entire World Gives a Damn About Me and This is Hopeless This is the second time that this has happened.\n\nI'm so sick. I hate the person that this process is making me become. I'm actually writing this through tears and I can't even eat. I've cried for two days and I'm becoming and angry, resentful, and withdrawn person, and it's not as simple as \"don't let it define you, don't let it consume you, well if they act like that then that's not a place you'd want to work anyway\" not when my time is being wasted and my livelihood is at stake.\n\nFor a little bit of background, I am about to be a junior in college; I am pursuing a B.B.A. in accounting and plan to get a second degree, and M.B.A. in finance and a jurisdoctorate in corporate law.\n\nI posted some similar gripes a few weeks ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/lbbtd5/its_just_one_disappointment_after_another/).\n\nShortly after that I ended up applying to what seemed like the perfect job. I was even more elated because I was greeted by an all black staff. Implicit racism has been a serious issue at my previous jobs (and I know that this doesn't mean that black people can't have prejudices against other black people but please don't be obtuse). The entire process went off without a hitch. Both managers were highly complementary of me and I was astounded at how much I had in common with them in regards to our educational and vocational background. Both of these ladies said multiple times in some form or another \"we're going to move forward with you.\" I remember it as clear as day.\n\n\"I really like you and I would love to move forward with you.\"\n\n\"I think you'd be a great fit.\"\n\n\"\\[insert manager's name here\\] correct me if I'm wrong but we're are definitely gonna move forward with her.\"\n\n\"No we are definitely gonna move forward with her\"\n\n\"Okay Xicaras, these are the steps that need to be completed for your onboarding and this is the specific date that you can expect to hear from us.\"\n\n\"We have to follow through on the formality of interviewing other candidates but we will definitely move forward with you.\"\n\n\"We will call you to follow up. You will hear back from us.\"\n\nAnd then today, \"\\[we already made a decision. Sorry. We got someone else.\"\n\nAlthough not following up with a candidate after a decision, even if it is a rejection is an abhorrent practice, it's one to which I have become accustomed. What separates this experience from all the others is the volume of lies and deception that accompanied it.\n\nThe hiring spent a substantial amount of the interview explaining her credentials and boasting about her various distinctions and numerous HR credentials and certifications. She was one of the people who told me directly to my face that 1) she would move forward with me and 2) she would follow up with me, those two things of which she did neither. I would think that she, more than anyone, with her extensive HR experience, would know better than to let three weeks go by without following up.\n\nNow I'm not stupid, I know that usually, if it's not a yes, it's a no. But it *was* a yes. Normally, I wouldn't have even bothered to get a confirmed no, but after explaining the situation to my mom (who *also* has and exhaustive list of HR certifications and 5 degrees, 3 of which are advanced), she suggested that I ask them to answer for why they blatantly lied. She said that their behavior was cowardly and that they should be have to *tell* me know and not be able to just ghost me as if I don't exist That's what separates this from the other experiences. I was ***lied*** to.\n\nOn one hand I feel naive. In the grand scheme of things it was a small lie that probably won't affect me 5 years from now, but it's the principle of the situation. This woman, with her many distinctions and numerous credentials, is a liar.\n\nAgain, if I didn't have valuable resources that I was wasting each time I attended these interviews, I probably wouldn't care. But what bothers me is that since the beginning of the pandemic, I've noticed this increasing sense of superiority amongst hiring managers, as if they don't actually have any intention on actually filling these positions, but that they just love the euphoria of being able to tell people \"no.\" It's as if they believe that the pandemic won't end one day. It's as if they don't realize that one day they will have to stop power tripping and *actually*  hire someone. It's as if they believe that one day they can't be in the exact same position as the millions of unemployed people around the world.The most credible people I've been forced to answer to have also had the least amount class, empathy, and intelligence.\n\nI'm still dignified, so I will never, ever ***beg*** someone to allow me to work for them, but after numerous reviews and edits to my resume, hundred of applications, hoards of abysmal and repulsive behaviors and practices, and an overwhelming amount of useless advice and poor attempts and motivation, I really do feel as if I'm unworthy of a job, unhirable, and expendable.\n\nI don't know what I'm going to do next, but I know more than anything that this is beyond hopeless.\n\nUPDATE: Thank you for everyone who responded. I know I'm contradicting myself with what I wrote, but I really hate feeling sorry for myself/having a pity party. Writing out all of my thoughts was the only non-destructive or non-self sabotaging thing I knew to do. I appreciate all of you.",

    "text": "Uh oh. Dream job turned toxic Hi all, \n\nI’ve been in my current role for about six months now (cardiac clinic manager, 60staff, 2 sites). I relocated for this awesome opportunity and had nothing but positive interactions during interview/recruiting process (and have a family friend that works for boss, lots of good info). \n\nI started off with a large number of improvement  projects (as planned during interview, one of main reasons I believed I was hired) - LEAN/PMI related work, implemented data/analytics tools that hadn’t existed previously.  Things were looking good!\n\nUnfortunately, there had been a number of prior HR cases (started before me) that were not necessarily handled well (poor/no documentation in a union environment) as well as a number of toxic staff issues. So far, we’ve had almost 8 staff depart in the short period of time I’ve been here, all seeming to relate to extensive culture issues..not just the recent surge  of staffing mobility due to covid. \n\nI am now starting to notice significant disconnects between my boss and i (she previously managed the group, moved to director). She doesn’t seem to want to let go of her old job, micromanages most of the work that I should be doing and is not willing to step back.. \n\nI already approached to and expressed my concern, trying to identify what improvements I can make to help (align my work style with her preference, communicate in to her preference etc). I felt I made a concerted effort to meet her requests and it seems she now focuses on anything possible that could be construed as negative/something lacking in my end. \n\nMaybe I am over analyzing the situation, but I feel like now I am the black sheep of the group and being “iced out”. She will be warm/bubbly with other leaders, but her responses to me are curt/all business. I have tried to relate on a personal level and make an attempt daily to update her, share what’s new/how her weekend was etc. \n\nNot sure if I should keep playing the game, or if I need to just cut my losses and begin looking elsewhere. \n\nTldr: scored dream job, turned toxic, six fig but at such a cost to sanity\n\nMy venting may just get lost in the threads, but hopefully someone has been in a similar circumstance and has some tips. I’ve reviewed so many blog posts, HBR articles..\n\nThanks",

    "text": "How to write a cover letter and resume I heard all of you, so now I am going to be attempt to be a part of the solution and not the problem, so without further ado...here's how to do both, first lets' start with a cover letter.\n\nWhat's a cover letter: A quick nitty gritty view of you that is a condensed version of your resume plus your personality kicked in, so when a few things before I show you how to write one:\n\n1. Have multiple cover letters: If you are applying for a manager role make the cover letter specific to being a manager with the traits and competencies attached to it. A line worker? Customer service? Whatever, you want multiples. Not only will this make it faster for you to apply for roles, but as you build your networking base as you sent out set cover letters you can add them to your job seeker folder on your computer or wherever you store it.\n2. Give it color: I don't literally mean color, I mean don't be afraid to let the interviewer see who you are...\n3. Key words key words key words: You are a master at SAS (software as a service) add it, you know python, HTML, java script, add it, some companies do use screening tools that will look out for this.\n4. Highlight any awards, accomplishments achievements: Even I sold the most subscriptions at gamestop carries weight over a guy who just wrote (worked at gamestop). \n\nSo how do you format? Okay so my cover letter looks something like:\n\nIf you are looking for the best instructional designer in your company for x role, then I 13inchmushroommaker am the guy for you. I have over 15 years in training and development, coupled with my masters in organizational leadership i've had the privilege of working for some of the largest organizations on earth that have gained me such skills as xyz that I have applied in xyz ways. To recap if an ID who is both a great mix of experience and education that has out of the box solutions is what you need then I 13inchmushroomaker is the person you are looking for. \n\nOkay now your resume, and how to format:\n\n1. Career objective: State in 3-5 sentences what your goal is, what you are, what you intend to do, and don't be afraid of putting in where you'd like to be in a few years.\n2. Job experience: What most people don't put here is the software/hardware they used, they only stated what they did. They only don't state what awards, achievements, praises they've won. Did you improve the company at all? Add that.\n3. Education: This goes at the bottom, but the same as above, any achievements? awards? clubs? extra curriculars? You can even attach hobbies here if they have some relevance. You gonna be a security guard? A bjj black belt looks good on there.\n4. Skills: Okay i've notice people just throw random things out there. Don't do that. Gather like terms, you do software? Add all the software under software, hardware under hardware etc. Make it easier for them to scan through.\n5. References: Don't add them, put them available by request. \n6. One page resumes: Fuck that, that is old school. If someone tells you that your resume needs to be one page they can suck it. \n\nThat is not a comprehensive list but it's what has worked for me even to this day, if you have questions or want to call it \"shit\" advice like someone else did, please don't hesitate to do so.",

    "text": "Problems at my first week at work. It's my first week working at a warehouse for an airline. My supervisor talked to me. He told me that 'other people are saying' or potentially talking to management about me. There's rumours that I sit down too much during downtime. That I'm on my phone too much. That I'm not answering the door when we get clients. Here's the problem... I don't think I sit down a lot. I leave my phone inside my locker now. I also answer the door when someone knocks. Basically, I have no idea where these rumors are coming from or why and- when I first heard about it- I was very disappointed. I'm not blaming my co-workers or anything. I'm just bummed out that that's the impression I've given.\n\nThankfully, a number of my supervisors and co-workers had my back when management talked to them. They told management that I don't do the things that some other people think I'm doing.\n\nI'm young (26). A lot of my co-workers are older than me (50+). I'm black. My co-workers are white. I'm not from the area. I'm from Ontario. I'm right now in Nova Scotia (Canada). There's also this automatic... let's call it \"hostility\" towards me because I'm getting paid at a higher rate than they were when they started the job. So, I'm already at a disadvantage. I'm pretty sociable. I do make jokes. Not at the same level as the older employees, obviously. But I do carry out conversations.\n\nIn short, I don't know how much of this is legitimate.\n\n***Am I really sitting around too much or do all these other factors put a target on me?***\n\nThe worst part is, word has spread around the warehouse about me being disappointed or bummed out. And now, that's adding more fuel to the fire. I'm not sure where I go form here.",

    "text": "Finally got my first job at 18; super stoked :) This is I think my first post here, but I scored my very first job at a cafe yesterday!!\n\nWas considered over indeed after filling out about 15 or so applications (ofc not the first time I've mass-applied but the timing is rlly good so ig i can't be mad lol) and through expressing that I was in fact interested in working there and comfirming it would be my first job, I was instructed to further my chance with a call or email to the hiring manager.\n\nSo i called the next day and was asked about my availability - open availability as I'm a college freshman with online classes -  and was asked if i could come in for interview same day around an hour from then. Ofc i was, so i got dressed in a black polo, black jeans, and converse and put my hair in a ponytail and arrived about 10 minutes early. Very casual interview and sort of amusing to hear how obviously fast-paced behind the counter was (i adore cafes and such calm but bustling settings, but i think i was hearing a machine get cleaned lol, it was so interesting) while the manager copied my ID and stuff.\n\nThey confirmed my info and explained the basics of the process to me and it was just overall chill.\n\ni wish those who are still job-seeking the best of luck and remember to say you're open, my big sister and her fiancee who've worked for many years in the food and customer service industry told me that availability, time-management, and confidence will ensure you a job. this was the first time i had ever had an interview or response - further than a rejection - and it went extremely well, so believe in yourself too!!\n\n\\~ if you read this, thank you for showing interest, i hope to talk about things i experience a bit more here, bye bye!!\n\nTL;DR - First job after years of seeking, believe in yourself :D",

I have previous experience and everything is the same where I worked before so no challenges. They only give me 36 hours a week which they split the hours into 6 days and I have no real freedom. We do solo shifts which is easy though.\n\nIt all started with my manager's boss, he would edit my hours to save payroll. When I realized and brought it up, my manager's boss said he would fix it and never did and my manager who is always friendly told me I shouldn't bring it up to higher ups otherwise it could make me lose my job. Well her boss got fired and was replaced by someone who ain't better. \n\nHer new boss assumed that one of us is being stealing merchandise because the inventory numbers were wrong and I feel like they assumed it was me. Judging from the camera it was my coworker and they haven't fired him at all yet. I have been micromanaged like not allowed to wear any long sleeve shirt under my work skirt or about my shoes not being fully black but having a bit of white. All of this started with the new boss.

    "text": "Got told by my boss that i'm not professional-looking because I don't wear makeup I'm currently training as a relief manager for hotels/motels, there's a guy a few years older than me that's also training here and I just gotta vent a little bit about this whole thing. \n\nSo this job is dope, it's such a great way to make loads of money and have the lifestyle I want i.e. travelling around the country and basically only needing to work for ~20 weeks of the year to make the same amount I make doing waitressing/bartending full-time. I'm super hyped about it, very enthusiastic doing my best to learn every aspect of the job and find the best way for me to complete all my tasks in an efficient and effective way. \n\nIn that aspect, my boss has said i'm doing great. The guy i'm training alongside is achieving half the stuff I do, with less efficiency and just a general sense of 'I hate this'. Which is fine, maybe this isn't for him, we're still pretty early in the process. The boss is giving him the exact same amount of 'you're doing great!' though. Hurts a lil bit. Thought maybe she's just nice and says that to keep your self-confidence up.\n\nToday was our 5th day on the job, we're here from 7am to 7pm so by now we're all pretty comfortable with each other and speaking our minds. Boss pulls me aside today after I finished all my morning tasks and tells me I don't look very professional and if I could dress more appropriately in future.\n\nThis is when the exhaustion finally got to me. I've been wearing smart-casual clothes all week. Today I was wearing black jeans and this lovely light brown velvet shirt with a collar, in my mind a perfectly okay outfit. I even thought I was overdressing when I first put it on because the other trainee just wears your average kmart V-neck and jeans.\n\nThe boss left for a few hours so I took the chance to ask the other guy if she said anything to him too. 'No, she hasn't even hinted at it..' he replied.\n\nAt the end of the day I asked the boss what she'd prefer I wear, thinking maybe I had completely misunderstood this whole thing, and after beating around the bush she got to point and told me I should wear some makeup.\n\nI hate makeup. Not as a principle like, you do you queen. It's just I personally hate wearing it and after the age of 16 never really felt like I needed to. Besides the odd PMS pimple, I have good skin. Even barring the mental side of it, literally as soon as I have any on I can *feel* my face way too much, I feel like i'm wearing a mud mask and can't express myself fully. Mascara always ends up smudged on my cheeks and I decided many many years ago that the whole thing just wasn't my jam.\n\nI just can't believe in this day and age, in this job I thought was so perfect for me that I could live my vanlife dreams and travel all year round, this is the fucking thing i'm being pulled up on. The double standards that lace our society like  a fancy top-hat made with mercury, it's exhausting!!\n\nAfter a big-ol cry and complaining to a friend, i've decided i'm not budging. I have never been treated poorly or like i'm unprofessional because I don't wear makeup. I used to work at a top-end hotel as a bartender, the kind that made me wear a waist-coat, polyester pants and leather shoes- and even there it wasn't an issue. Maybe i'm wrong. Maybe this will blow up in my face. But at least if it does, it'll blow up in *my* face- not the face someone else made me wear.\n\n\nEdit: Gooood morning reddit... Holy crap this went bananas! Thank you for all the awards and upvotes. It's so lovely to have support from so many of you, and i'm so so glad my little rant gave us all the opportunity to gather together and share stories and wisdom. I don't know if i'll have time to reply to everyone, but i'll try my best!\n\n\nEdit 2: Some of you lovely people were asking for an update on how confronting her goes down. I finished all the office work and most of the check-ins for today, so I sat down with her and just told her I thought about what she said, but I really don't feel comfortable wearing makeup, that it distracts me and actually makes me feel more selfconscious. She completely understood! She said she was sorry, that she thought i'd never considered wearing makeup before and that she was trying to help me. \n\nWe both agreed it will probably be a recurring conversation i'll have to have, and might sometimes cost me a job somewhere high-end. But in the end of the day that's not the kind of job i'm looking for when more casual places suit me down to the ground! \n\nThank you again for all your incredible messages of support and similar stories from your own experiences. I feel more confident now to put my foot down (in a non-aggressive way) whenever this comes up in future. And if I ever feel like Dolling up a bit, you've given me some great suggestions of ways to do it without spending a fortune or feeling too restricted. I love you all!!",

Our county still has a mandate, and my workplace asks that while you sit down to eat and drink you put your mask back on when you aren’t actively consuming something. The vast majority of our customers love this policy and follow it, as well as tell us they come to our shop because we maintain it so strictly and it makes them feel safe. \n\nOne of my first customers this morning had his nose out of his mask, and I politely reminded him (we have written policies on every door and table in the building) that we ask you cover your nose with your mask. He pulled his money back as he was about to pay and told me he didn’t know if he wanted to eat here. I told him that was fine, and if he wanted to leave  he could. He hesitated, then paid, and told his son who was with him that he wanted to go outside so he didn’t have to be discriminated against for having his mask down. Whatever, he leaves and his kid waits for the order. I see him leave the building and angrily throw his mask on the ground, then come back in, put on a disposable one we have set out for customers, and asks why I wasn’t telling two people sitting at a table nearby to put theirs on. I told him since they’re actively drinking they’re allowed to have them off. He then says something to the effect of “Oh, so you’re just segregating me? Why can’t I have my mask off?” And while I’m in the middle of explaining our policy again he interrupts me to say “I don’t think you have any right to tell me what to cover when you’re wearing that-“ and gestures to my top. \n\nI’ve dealt with my fair share of rude customers but I’ve never had someone slut-shame me for what I was wearing. I just directed him to my managers who were sitting nearby discussing something if he had anything else to say and went back to the counter. He kept trying to get something out of me but we were slow so I just sat on my phone and ignored him as he took pictures of everyone in our establishment and then eventually left with his son. Later on I mentioned to my manager that we might get a shitty review and he said he had overheard it and decided not to step in since I’ve dealt with shitty customers before. I’m just feeling very left out to dry about the whole situation, because the only person who offered support in the moment was a woman who witnessed it happen and came up to comfort me after he left. \n\nI wore a pair of baggy high waisted jeans, platform docs, and a knit black tanktop to work today. The straps on my top were thin, but it wasn’t revealing. Barely any of my cleavage was showing, but it feels particularly gross that a middle aged man used it to pick on me for enforcing a policy at my place of work.\n\nEDIT: For anyone wondering I put in my two weeks today because of this, as well as months of shitty treatment from my managers. I asked my other manager (who was present and witnessing this event as well) if I could talk and she asked me to wait because she was busy today. So one polite email has found it’s way to her inbox, and I have a scheduled time tomorrow to talk with the company owner to make her aware of what’s been happening as most of my coworkers are still in high school and I don’t want them left like this. Thank you for all of your kind words and reassurance! :)",

    "text": "My usually lovely fiancé has come out with most bigoted, close-minded crap out of seemingly nowhere. I work in an historically very male workplace. They have a recruitment policy of interviewing 50% women, 50% men. My (male) manager has repeated this fact a few times. I'm unsure of his motivations for even sharing that info. Anyway I met my fiancé at work. He's otherwise a left-voting, kind and tolerant person. \n\nThe reason I've made this post is because I told him we're getting two new members of staff, 1 man, 1 woman, and the man is called Igor and he's from Brazil. My boyfriend's responses were \"probably a transwoman or something\". My reaction was ????? He went on to say that the woman was probably black and/or in a wheelchair.\n\nHe just said he was concerned because the way they're handling things is going to result in a lot of young white men getting frustrated at having an unfair disadvantage and it'll backfire with more prejudice, if they keep losing out to them. He didn't use the term 'woke' but it seems like that line of argument has got through to him.\n\nI asked him how a Brazilian man would be unfairly advantaged, like we don't even know his race and Brazil has very different attitudes to race anyway. So I am left wondering where did it come from, and what is the best way to help him de-radicalise.\n\nLike I say, he's otherwise extremely \"progressive\" in our relationship, extremely pleasant to people and actually finds people of other backgrounds and cultures interesting. I was wondering whether other women have found this, and how to cope with it. \n\nIt really doesn't help that we work in a very macho, old-fashioned workplace and have a manager whose actions seem to encourage the idea that women like me had a helping hand and didn't earn our place, but I don't know how to change that either.\n\nIt's making me question my future with him, but I also have to live in a society with men like this so breaking up with him won't change much generally.",

    "text": "Birth abuse and the \"husband stitch\", not just a myth. A long needed weight off my chest. So I made an alternate account to share this story since I don't really want everyone I know to know about this. It's long, and graphic, but I need it out there.\n\nI'm 40. When I was 25 I had my first child. I had researched and thought I was well informed, I'd still argue that I was and that I had advocated for myself loudly. However, what I learned was that, when dealing with the medical community as a pregnant woman, often you're dismissed, scorned or flat out ignored. I'm in Canada, white, married, and was a \"suitable\" age to be having a child, but I was still treated as an inconvenience at best and as a total idiot far too often.\n\nAt about 20 weeks I started retaining a ton of water. My feet were also turning purple anytime I stood for long. As any concerned pregnant woman would, I went to my doctor about it. I was assured that everything was fine and that everything I was experiencing was normal. It didn't feel normal however and I brought it up again and again at every appointment only to be assured repeatedly, and with some annoyance, that everything was fine. I ballooned out, was exhausted all the time, I couldn't stand or walk for long, I was often dizzy. I figured it was *just* pregnancy. \n\nWhen I and my husband went in for my 37 week checkup, we didn't even see my doctor. Another doctor met me at the reception as I was checking in and said \"Oh, we're sending you to the hospital for an induction today.\" Shocked, I asked why and was told that I had pregnancy induced hypertension (used to be called preeclampsia) and that my blood pressure had been dangerously high and that I needed to be induced ASAP. I was stunned. How could this be, I asked, no one had told me anything about this! The doctor seemed surprised and checked my file again, she was sure, it was marked right here. I was told that I and my baby were in \"serious danger\" and that I *needed* to go straight to the hospital, no there wasn't even time for me to go home and get my bag, I'd have to get family to bring it. \n\nI left the office, broke down in the car, and my husband drove me to the hospital.\n\nI don't care to write every detail here, suffice to say it was a humiliating and painful birth experience. It took three days to have my baby. Highlights include being forced into labour with a \"balloon\" and a pitocin drip, then pushed up to nearly delivering, then \"turned down\" and \"shelved\" in a room for 24 hours until more rooms opened up and they were ready to deal with me. I was then \"turned up\" again and moved to a delivery room. I spent some time labouring in a bed in a hallway,  had countless people through the room, no one asked me if minded or even explained who they were. At one point this included a team of students there to observe. \n\nI am a loud and somewhat aggressive person and I asked lots of questions, but largely was dismissed, ignored or simply unanswered. I was given an epidural, not my choice. I was told it was medically necessary to preserve my and my baby's life. The epidural made it impossible for me to do more than sit up slightly. I wasn't able to get up, stand or walk at all. I could still feel plenty though, including when I needed to push. This wasn't surprising to me, I had a documented medical history of pain killers and freezing medications wearing off 3-4 times faster than average. The nurse argued that this wasn't  possible, that I was just \"overly anxious\". I told her I could feel the baby coming and she rolled her eyes and checked, only to see my baby's head halfway out. She told me to \"wait for the doctor!\" There was no waiting however and out my daughter came, barely caught by the nurse.\n\nShe wanted to whisk her away to another room to clean up, but I wouldn't have it and insisted she and my husband stay in the room. I was finally given my daughter and an intern doctor showed up to check me over. I was told to push once again and he pulled the placenta out with a sharp tug.\n\nDue to retaining so much water and then being hooked to a variety of drips for the last 3 days, my tissues were \"waterlogged\" and had torn quite badly when my daughter was born. The intern set to stitching me up. He told me that the damage was extensive, but not to worry, he'd \"stitch everything up nice and tight for my husband again\". I had absolutely no idea what he meant, I just assumed he was trying to be funny or something and blew it off, engaged in my daughter. \n\nEverything seemed ok and my husband, who had been by my side the entire 3 days, was exhausted and hungry and needed a bathroom. He said he'd be back in a few minutes, I said that was fine and I was left on my own.\n\nAfter a few minutes the nurse came back in and told me she needed to palpate my uterus to ensure that all the pieces of the placenta had come out. She took my daughter and placed her in a bassinet and then laid me back down and massaged my uterus. It was incredibly painful and I asked her to stop, but she insisted it was necessary and kept on. This apparently prompted me to pass a larger than acceptable piece of placenta (remember, I wasn't allowed to simply deliver the placenta, it was pulled from me). She called the intern back (I still had not seen an \"actual\" doctor) who proceeded to push at my uterus even harder and who ignored me completely, let alone my demands that he stop and explain.\n\nThen, he briefly told me that it was necessary that they get all the remaining pieces of placenta out and that I \"couldn't be feeling anything since my epidural must still be working\". I assured him that it was not, that I could feel *everything* and that I have a documented medical history of freezing and pain relievers wearing off faster than they should. He dismissed this completely and proceeded to push his entire hand up inside my uterus to manually remove any remaining bits of placenta. I screamed and demanded he stop, the nurse even told him he needed to stop, he insisted that he was \"almost done\" and kept on. After what felt like an eternity, he finished, and told me \"that wasn't so bad was it\". It was about then that my husband came back in the room. I was furious, in pain and upset and told him what had happened. Meanwhile, the nurse realized that I was bleeding. A lot. She called the intern back in and he started stitching me up, again. I had no pain killer and finally the nurse gave me nitrous oxide to inhale, only it made me violently sick. So I could choose between momentary pain relief, followed by pain and vomiting, or just enduring the pain.\n\nHowever, the bleeding wasn't stopping and finally an actual OB was called in. She was the first person to treat me like an actual person. She took one look at me and immediately began yelling at the intern. What had happened was that because of all the fluid in my tissues, when he decided to reach up inside me, he tore the skin inside my vaginal cavity in many places. I was hemorrhaging blood now. \"Shredded\" was the word she had used. The nurse asked if they should prep an emergency surgery and she said there wasn't time and ordered a team to the delivery room. She explained everything to me as she worked, she told me that she was trying to stop the bleeding by stitching the tears, but that this stitching was simply causing more tears at this point. She then told me that she was going to pack my entire vaginal cavity with gauze in the hopes that is would stop the bleeding and give me a blood transfusion. Then we would see how it went and hopefully, since I had given birth, the edema in my tissues would go down and she would be able to make repairs. So that's what she did.\n\nI spent 5 days in the hospital afterwards. The following day the packing was removed and further stitching done inside. I was encouraged to try to get up and move. When I stood up however, everything went black. It was another 2 days before I could get out of bed and have my catheter removed. I was finally discharged and sent home to recover. \n\nHealing took months. Again, my concerns about the pain and discomfort, this time with a new doctor, were dismissed repeatedly. The stitches were supposed to dissolve, but I have weird synthetic allergies and so they didn't. So 6 months post-partum, after I had finally demanded they at least look at them, an internal inspection was done which revealed a raging allergic reaction/infection and the stitches were removed over two separate sessions in hospital and I was placed on antibiotics. Finally, I healed.\n\nI figured I was finally done with all this, after a month more of healing, I was finally able to have sex again. Only, it hurt. A lot. I figured maybe things were just sensitive down there still, but it never seemed to get any less painful. I realized that some positions, ones that put more pressure or stretching on my perineum, were more painful than others. My husband said there was a wide ridge of scar tissue there and after some more intense self-exploration, I realized that what had happened was that the intern had \"stitched me up nice and tight\" alright, by sewing closed a half inch or more of my vaginal opening just above my perineum. I was beyond upset, I was furious. I made an appointment with a doctor that had some experience in this area and was told that, what I had suspected was entirely right, that it was shockingly common in women post-birth, usually they had no idea that it had been done to them until long after birth, and that I would require a surgical procedure to return things to \"normal\" and be able to have pain free sex again. However, she said, if I planned on having any more children, I might want to wait as often the birth of the second baby can fix the damage done.\n\nMy husband and I had always planned to have more children, but the first birth was...traumatic to say the least. I decided that I wanted answers for what had happened to me. So I started with my doctor who cared for me during my pregnancy. I made an appointment and met with her and asked why she hadn't told me about my condition? Why had she not informed me of my options? And why had she decided, without consulting me, that I would be induced at 37 weeks? Her answers were condescending and unsatisfactory. She told me that she had felt that it was in my best interest not to know. That first time mothers usually caused themselves more stress than necessary. She felt that, if she told me, that the stress of worrying about my condition would be worse than simply monitoring the condition herself. I asked why she had not discussed the option of medications with me, or any treatment options prior to an induction. She reiterated that telling me would cause greater problems and that she could not proscribe me a medication without telling me what it was for. I was shocked. I asked her how she felt ok with that choice? She had no idea what I was doing in my life. Only a week before going in I had been painting our nursery and had been up high on a ladder, felt dizzy and light headed, and had needed to lie down for awhile. She seemed surprised and said that she had asked me if I was working still when I had complained about the swelling, and so she assumed that I was \"taking things easy\" when she learned that I was not working. I was incredulous. I asked why she had sent me for an induction (without even being present at my appointment to discuss it with me) and she said that she had determined that was the best course of action at 20 weeks, assuming I carried that long. Afterall, delivering the baby was the \"cure\", so she figured it made the most sense to get to 37 weeks and then have the baby. I asked if we could have likely monitored my condition, tried medications to manage my blood pressure, and allowed me to go to full term and labour naturally. She said we probably could have, but why would we? I left, angrier than I had been to start, and lodged a formal complaint against her, as well as requested all my medical records from my delivery and hospital stay. \n\nWhen they arrived I was shocked to see there was absolutely no record of my having any stitching or anything. The blood transfusion was listed as \"due to extensive bleeding during delivery\" and there was no record of the name of the intern, any of the stitching done, or the 5 days I spent in hospital afterwards. My records had me listed as \"discharged\" the same day my daughter was born.\n\nI lodged formal complaints against both the hospital and my doctor (again), but nothing ever came of either of them to my knowledge. I was certainly never contacted and was dismissed as a matter of form whenever I tried to enquire. \"Someone will reach out to you if they need to.\" I was told.\n\nMy trust in the medical system was done though. We did decide to have another child (not an easy choice), and my pregnancy with him, and his birth, was followed by midwives instead. I had explained my previous experience and they took great care to explain every single thing. Every step of the way. My son was delivered at home, naturally, and with no complications, despite having the cord wrapped around his neck, his body and his arm several times. I double checked everything and was never able to take anything on faith again. I also refuse still to ever be left unattended while in medical care, for any period of time. \n\nOn the bright side, my son's birth did fix my \"husband stitch\" issue. I've been able to have pain free sex again ever since. And no one offered to stitch anything up afterwards for my husband's enjoyment.\n\nIronically, the pain from the stitching seriously impeded my, and my husband's, sex lives for more than 2 years, so it didn't even achieve what it was intended to. Because yeah, who finds it \"sexy\" when having sex with their wife causes her extreme pain?!\n\nWomen are routinely dismissed and abused within the medical system. So much of what happened to me was so clearly a result of a \"I'm the medical person, I know best and this is what needs to be done\". My opinions, my right to have knowledge about what was happening to me, my thoughts, my experience, even my own physical sensations were dismissed out of hand. My autonomy over my own body was stripped away from me in a very real, highly traumatic and painful way. I was rendered helpless and everything that happened to me happened without my consent, often while completely ignoring my saying \"no\". I was physically violated in an incredibly painful and humiliating way and it was treated as nothing more than a matter of course.\n\nI've never been able to get so much as even an acknowledgement of the reality of what happened to me. If my husband andy mom had not been there through it with me, I wouldn't have any outside validation, or belief, of what happened to me.\n\nThis is not acceptable. Women have every right to expect honest, forthright and respectful care while in the hands of the medical community.\n\nWomen have every right to expect to not be violated and traumatised while in their care.\n\nI'd like to believe this is no longer the same, that attitudes that allowed this to happen to me then aren't the same now.\n\nOnly, that's not the case. \n\nMy sister just had her first baby. \n\nAfter years of struggling with reproductive issues. Pain, heavy bleeding, cysts, etc from the time she was 12. She was told she wouldn't be able to have children, she was diagnosed with PCOS, she had her baby through a fertility clinic, but was able to carry and deliver her child herself. \n\nShe was just told she has stage 4 endometriosis. That she will never be able to have another child. That it's miraculous that she was able to have this one. That, had she just found out sooner, they could have tried various treatments, but now it's too late. She was furious. How could they say \"if only she'd gotten treatment sooner\"?! How could she have possibly been any more proactive? She has been inspected by more doctors than anyone I know, but because she was young (early 30's now) no one took her seriously. They put her on birth control, they told her \"some people just have painful periods\". Now she's demanding they remove her uterus. And still they say \"oh, but what if you want more kids?\" In one breath they tell her she can't have more children and in the next they say they don't want to remove her uterus \"just in case\". She insisted and they agreed, eventually, but only after she tries a medication that \"might\" help slow the growths. For 3 months. Medication that makes her incredibly ill. \n\nEven then, they're only agreeing to a partial hysterectomy, despite her having PCOS and having been warned for years that she will eventually need to have her ovaries out. So here she is, with a young baby and having to take medication she doesn't want, to be allowed to remove her own uterus she also doesn't want, and she's having to fight tooth and nail to just get that far, let alone the issue of leaving her ovaries with cysts inside her.\n\nNone of this is ok.\n\nWhy isn't this changing??",

    "text": "No one told me that getting an IUD doesn’t HAVE TO be mind-bendingly painful So I’m here to tell you that there is another way! \n\nWhen I got my first IUD 5 years ago, it was hands down the most painful experience of my life and I know my story isn’t unique. I literally spent the procedure screaming in pain til my throat was raw, and I nearly blacked out. I am not someone with a typically low pain tolerance by any stretch of the imagination. I wasn’t offered any sort of medication (no painkillers other than being told to take Tylenol a few hours ahead of time) and not a single warning of how severe the pain would be other than “You might feel some cramping”. \n\nI will say, the experience of having an IUD was a JOY! 5 years of pregnancy protection, plus no more periods, was easily enough for me to consider getting it replaced, but I was terrified of going through that agony again. I did some research, and found a few people who mentioned going under twilight anesthesia to get theirs (mostly from countries other than the US, where I’m based). For reference this is what they typically use to put people under for procedures like colonoscopies, or wisdom tooth removal. \nSo when the time came, I insisted to my doctor that this is what I want. I was prepared to fight her on it - hell I had even found another doctor 6 hours upstate who openly advertised that he anesthetized patients undergoing IUD insertion. Lo and behold, my doctor was entirely okay with going this route, despite the fact that it’s not something typically offered outright.\n\nToday was the big day! I went in to the surgery center early this morning to remove my old one and put the new one in. They took me back, gave me an IV, put me down for an awesome nap, and when I woke up it was done and I was in NO pain. Seriously, I haven’t even needed an over the counter painkiller today. \n\nI truly don’t believe this option would have been offered outright to me if I didn’t bring it up myself, so I guess the reason I’m making this post is to encourage readers to advocate for their own pain management needs. The fact that women’s pain is so often ignored is barbaric, and we deserve better. I do recognize that not everyone is lucky enough to live within a reasonable radius of a physician who will listen - I ended up in a pretty privileged position in this case (not to mention the fact that I’m under insurance willing to cover the majority of the costs). \nStill, if you’re considering getting an IUD, I HIGHLY recommend at least asking to be put under sedation. It made a world of difference and hopefully in the future it’ll be the norm.\n\nHappy to answer any questions about my experience!\n\nTLDR: Getting an IUD with twilight sedation was easy, painless and I highly recommend pursuing it!",

    "text": "My pain was validated. I am still overwhelmed at the support I have received. I'm 21 years old and have never had a normal period. From my first period at 13 to now, all of my periods have been extremely heavy, extremely painful, and life hindering. I would wear an ultra sized tampon and a night time pad together and still leak through them. My cramps would cause me to black out, throw up, get dizzy, or just bring me to the floor. To make it better, I would have severe spasms in my rectum that brought me to the floor for a couple seconds or half a minute. There were no warnings before they happened. I would be at school or in public and just collapse from the spasms.\n\nMy mom used to tell me to get over it and how she had to deal with 2 week long periods and if she could do it, I could, too. I had blood clots bigger than a QUARTER and she'd tell me that was normal.\n\nMy dad believed me and took me to the doctor at 15 years old. I was put on birth control to manage the symptoms. 6-7 types of pills later and I find the one that works. It's also the one that nobody makes! Finding a pharmacy that sold it was hard and I had to travel up to 40 minutes away just to get some. The pill barely helped but I made the most of it.\n\nLast year, I had an IUD put in. It has been incredibly helpful and I have had absolutely no symptoms until last week. I woke up for work and was brought to the floor by the severe cramps and nausea. I nearly threw up on my rabbit because I was in so much pain. I thought my IUD had moved out of place. I went to THREE doctors to find the cause and they all said it's likely my endometriosis since my IUD was fine. Pelvic exams, blood work, urinalysis, an ultrasound and a transvaginal ultrasound found everything to be normal. \n\nI missed work for 3 days and I felt terrible. I just started my job two months ago and I'm on my probation period. I went back to work today and had to leave after 3 fucking hours because I was in severe pain and nearly passed out. While I was there, my female coworkers asked how I was doing and why I was out. I told them, and my coworker immediately said, \"I know exactly what you're talking about. I have that\" and told me how she had to have an ovary removed due to having a cyst so big she looked fucking pregnant. She told me to take care of myself and that this shit isn't a joke. My other coworker told our boss I wasn't feeling well and I had to have EMS check me out due to my symptoms.\n\nEMS guy was super nice. I told him about my condition and he told me I need to see a specialist. I was concerned about missing more work and told him I felt bad about leaving and he said, \"So? You have a chronic condition. You need to seek help for it. If your bosses have an issue with it, they can read the report we'll type up after this that shows you have a condition that needs medical attention. They can also come talk to me about it.\" I told him I was worried about being fired since I'm new and he said if they penalize me, he'll talk to them and HR about it because it's something I can't help. He made me feel really good about it. It felt nice to know I'm not imagining it or being dramatic.\n\nPlease, for the love of rabbits, do not hold off on seeing a specialist if you think you have endo. This shit is affecting my daily life again. I had to miss days every month in high school to go to the ER because of the pain. It is NOT normal to:\n\n•bleed so heavily\n•to bleed for two fucking weeks in a row!!!\n•to have blood clots bigger than a quarter\n•bleed INBETWEEN periods, like a second period!!!\n•have pain so bad you're blacking out or straight up passing out\n\nYour pain is REAL. It is VALID. Don't dismiss your feelings the way I did. I grew up being told my symptoms were fake and now I'm too scared to fucking tell my boss I feel like I'm going to pass out because it feels like my insides are being shredded apart 'cause I'm scared of being told I'm lying, even if I'm pale in the face and sweating buckets. I nearly cried at work today when my coworkers were telling me about their experiences with endometriosis and how it has affected their lives.\n\nIt's another thing to overcome, but god damn. I am tired.",

That I cannot fathom.\n\nThe gender and ethnic background are important because there has already been some incidents of black on black racism/tribalism in the workplace. \n\nWith one black woman viciously shouting at another black woman (originating from a different country) , accusing her of being a \"coconut\".\n\n\nIt is a **non uniform** assisted living project for learning difficulties, uniforms would be too institutionalised for our service users as they are assisted at all ages throughout their life by us to live, travel and experience activities without having attention drawn to them, just because of their need for carers.

Many have left without ever revealing why.\n\nThis care home at every meeting says they are raising the bar of entry to new applicants, making it harder to get a job here, that new employees WILL need previous experience as we have become outbalanced by workers that have no previous experience. \n\n\nBut in action, the boss has made habit of hiring people specifically **without** experience in support work or care, or English as a first language, in order to be able to take advantage of their lack of experience and communication skills, so when asked to do something morally questionable, or tasks risky to theirs or others wellbeing without the correct or adequate equipment; the employee will simply agree and do it, without question, because they assume that their experienced superior... Knows best. \n\n\nI was told this story just today, it happened very recently. \nThe young woman who confided in me is considering leaving already because of this singular incident, that has happened less than a month after starting this new job.\n\n\nShe further confided to me that she had not long ago been a victim of rape. By her ex boyfriend. \nThe mother of the boyfriend asked her what she was wearing at the time and indicated that it was her fault for her choice of clothes. \n\nShe was wearing nightwear shorts and shirt, in the hallway of her own home.\n\n\nWhen faced with our boss and 2 other women, alone in a locked room, as they are picking apart her clothing choices and mixing reprimands of inappropriateness with.. seeming compliments?\n\nTelling her that her body is TOO curvy, and TOO sexy to be wearing THOSE clothes.\n\nBut \"it's okay, we'll let it go.. 'this one time' we're just looking out for you, I'm like your mum you know\"\n\n\nShe told me that this experience with our boss triggered the same feelings of fear when her ex boyfriend's mother blamed her for being raped. \n\n\nI can understand why she felt this way, but not fully, i don't think that as a man i will ever experience what it's like and I don't think I could ever truly be able to understand that kind fear. \n\n\nThis isn't about me.\nBut I was very angry. I couldn't believe my boss did this. \nI kept quiet, listened, and was glad i was wearing a face mask and facing partially away from her (i was driving in a work vehicle) so it hid some of the incredulous expressions my face must have been making.\n\n\nShe asked my advice and I said that I wouldn't blame her if she wanted to leave, but I encouraged her to get the company head office email from google and complain directly to HR (we don't have on site HR) \n\nI'm here because I'd like to ask 2XChromosome's advice about whether it's appropriate to make a complaint to head office myself.\n\nBut is it my place to do that?? \n\nIt feels wrong to just do nothing. \n\nHonestly, writing this all out is.. Just crazy to me.\n\nI'm starting to question if maybe I'm overreacting. \n\n\nI've written way too much, bless you if you read all of it, I've tried to provide as much context as possible. \n\n\nI could really do with some advice. \n\nEven just a sanity check.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: I forgot to say, she was wearing Sports leggings and a T-shirt.\nMany other women at work wear the same clothes without harrasment or reprimand, including the manager.\n\nNot that it should matter in this situation, but her clothes were perfectly appropriate. \nThe issue my manager had was with the young woman's body being \"too curvy\" IN those kind of clothes, which is.. Beyond inappropriate.\nHonestly. I'm still so upset and disturbed by this.\n\n\n\n\n\n       UPDATE:\n\nOkay, So I've talked with her privately and asked if she'd be comfortable with me making a complaint.\n\nI said that she shouldn't answer now, i was worried she would feel pressured in the moment to just agree with the man that's offering help.\n\nI said she should speak with her support network.\nShe then said that I am her support network, which nearly made me fucking cry. \nI asked her to please try find someone else to tell because it is so important. \nGet their opinion, ask what they think. \n\nShe got back to me and said yes and I've been writing it all up tonight.\n\nIt's like gone 4:45 am now so I'm gonna go to bed.\n\n\nI noticed a kind of unspoken theme in the comments that it was difficult to give advice somewhat because there was a question of this young women's size.\n\nI personally don't think it's an issue, i found out later that other workers saw her upset that day and they say that on that day she was covered up and not showing skin.\nThe leggings were FINE, appropriate and fine. \n\n\nBut for clarity, if it helps build a better picture- \nwe're in the UK and she's like 165cm-ish and about a size 10-12. \n\nI don't know what that is in American, and i hope it isn't offensive to reveal that about her, but I REALLY hope that knowing this makes people go:\n\n \"OH! Well... Fuck, what the hell is this managers problem?!\" \n\nFYI the manager is a size 16\nHow do i know this?\nBecause she inappropriately told us, at work, in a team meeting when discussing parts of her sex life with her divorced husband. \n\nThe way she described it, i felt like I'd been mentally flashed. \n\n\nShe. Is the worst. \n\nOkay, I gonna go now before i say more things that will get me kicked out and my post deleted. \n\nit's almost 5:00am and I'm super tired.\n\nThank you to everyone that commented.\n\nEVERYONE.\n\ngenuinely, i might not have responded much because each time i started writing a response i just felt like I was being inappropriate or disrespectful or insensitive so i deleted pretty much everything i started to write. \n\n\n\nBut i read each and every comment, all, many times.\n\nAnd it's really helped, I'm so glad i posted here.\n\n\n✌️\n\n\nThanks, you've all been so helpful and welcoming thank you all so much 🤘🤘",

    "text": "I think I might get murdered at work? So…I just started a restaurant job making salads and desserts in the back. It's a perfect job for me, the hours are short and flexible, it's super easy and non-stressful, my manager is so sweet and everyone else is a joy to be around. Except for one of the cooks. I'll call him Vani for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just started this job three weeks ago. On my first day the owner introduced me to everyone and I started my work. Everyone was kind and patient with me. At one point I had to put away a dish that was through the cooks station, so I handed it to one of the cooks, Vani, to put it away because I didn't want to get in his way. He just stared at me, frowning, until I asked him politely to take it, which he did reluctantly. At this, the other cook just smiled and said \"Don't let him scare you off, he's always like that.\" I wasn't bothered by this interaction, some people are just like that and I don't take things personally. I was determined to treat this guy like any of my other coworkers, because I try to give everyone respect until I feel as though they have rightfully lost it. That same day when I was making a dessert, he passed behind me and in a deep, gargled voice said \"Run.\" I thought he was trying to get a rise out of me and I shrugged it off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the second day when he saw me, he said \"You came back, I told you to run.\" I replied, \"But I like you guys,\" to which he shrugged and said, \"You're loss.\" Later I asked \"How are you doing?\" he said he was feeling homicidal and wanted to murder everybody. Of course everyone says this as a joke, people have dark senses of humor, but he didn't say it in a joking manner at all. So, I thought that he actually might dislike people and said this just to be extreme.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy interactions with Vani are limited. I see him at the beginning of my shift and greet him. He clearly tries to get a rise out of me. He sometimes comes into my work station to get something, in which case he always, *always* cusses really loud right behind me. I hear glimpses of him calling people a \"Fucker,\" or a \"R\\*tard.\" At one point I heard him directly cuss me out, saying \"This little fucker\" as he collected a dish that I had put in the wrong place. He looked at me as he said this. This doesn't really get to me, I don't give a damn about what this guy thinks about me. He might be a bit of an ass but whatever, I can deal with that. I continue to believe that he just wants to have a little fun freaking out 'the new girl'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt one point I pointed out his DC shirt and that was the first time we had a nice conversation. We both agreed that Marvel movies are just \"two hours of bland action\" and he remarked on how he approved of how DC went in a more dark, trauma related direction. I assumed he was talking about the new Joker movie. I can vibe with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut at my last shift, I jokingly asked him \"So do you feel like murdering everyone today?\" and the way he replied, \"if you really must know, yes,\" scared me for the first time. He sounded serious, so I asked \"do you really hate working here?\" He just looked at me and nodded, and I asked, \"So why do you work here then?\" at this, for some reason he gave a creepy laugh and I walked away. Shortly after he called out to me, \"Don't worry, I only have one week left.\"\n\nI assume he means that he's quitting, not that he's planning on murdering everyone in a week. But it's been on my mind even at home and I'm a little on edge to go back to work now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's one detail that makes this situation a bit touchy. He's a black man, and I'm a young white woman. I keep trying to check myself, would I actually be nervous if this man were white? I think I would, but implicate bias is real. I know his behavior is out of line for anybody, but the fact that he is black makes me not want to go to my manager about this. Also I don't want to escalate the situation. If I talk to my manager, she will likely talk to him, and the situation might get worse. I don't want to make him lose his job. Also if he actually has homicidal thoughts, this could make things way worse, right? He's either just an ass or he clearly needs help, but I have no idea what to do about that.\n\nI keep thinking, what if he does actually want to murder everyone and he's only telling me because I'm the 'new, naïve white girl.'\n\nI will say that he doesn't give off \"creeper vibes,\" he just seems like he hates everyone and he hates his life. He hardly ever smiles and he goes about everything with an air of distain for the world. I honestly feel bad for the guy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I don't have another shift for another couple days. I'm going to ask my manager if Vani is quitting, and if she says no, I will ask Vani what he meant by \"only having another week.\" I think I will straight up ask him if I should be concerned for my life. If he doesn't give me a straight answer, I think I will talk to my manager and consider quitting my job. I don't want to be going to work wondering if it's my last day, even if it is a joke.\n\nAm I taking this too seriously? Am I being racist? Any advice or insight would be great.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Edit\\]\n\nSo I haven't been murdered yet, thankfully. Vani took an offer at a different restaurant and left, as he said. I talked to my manager before he left, though, and let her know my concern. She took me seriously and gave me the rest of the week off until he left. But I had to go back in to grab something and I ran into Vani again. He apologized to me and said that he \"has a dark sense of humor and likes to make people laugh.\" So he was definitely hazing me whether that was his intention or not. Anyway, the owner later talked to me and apologized for his behavior, saying that he talked to Vani and everyone else individually to see if they had any issues. Like I thought, looks like I was the only one being targeted.\n\nThe owner said something very annoying, though. He told me that he understood that I came form a more \"conservative background\" (he knows of my very conservative mother but knows nothing about me or my past), so he \"understood\" why I got scared and and that \"some people come from darker upbringings\". He also told me that he doesn't normally let people cuss at work, as if that was the issue. It felt condescending, the way he said that, and I realized that this is how women are taught to suppress their gut feelings. Some men like to push us until we are uncomfortable, and then people tell us that we were over reacting.\n\nThis was a learning experience for me, thank you guys for helping me through it!",

    "text": "I left an emotionally abusive relationship and I'm going to a women's shelter with my 14 month old son tomorrow morning. (Throwaway because my main account made front page once for something dumb that I don't want to acknowledge.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease excuse this post, as it will most likely be a confusing and really long jumble of text but tonight I am at rock bottom in life, and I feel the need to just reach out into the internet void for advice, kind words, anything really at this point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a 27 year old single mom. From ages to about 18-25, I was just barely getting by in life. I have been depressed since I remember. I can't remember a time where I didn't have suicidal thoughts creep in when the depression got to it's worst. I dropped out of college. I smoke a lot of weed daily, I go between starving myself and binge eating, I struggle with hypersexuality to seek out a sense of worthiness. I am constantly ending up in unhealthy, strongly codependent (on my end) relationships. I barely pause between relationships, usually a few months. My longest relationship was 5 years. I am the black sheep of my family. They all love me, but also all talk to each other constantly about how I need to get my shit together and I agree. I got pregnant unexpectedly with a man I barely knew, and decided to go through with the pregnancy and try to make the relationship work. It didn't work out, but we remain civil. He has not been around much but he makes effort and this isn't about him. I never wanted kids but I cannot believe the love I have for my son. He is 14 months old, and the happiest, sweetest and most wonderful little boy. (I am biased.) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was living in an apartment that I was struggling to afford, and met a guy. He came on very strong, very quickly but I was in a vulnerable state and I couldn't believe a man like him was interested in me. Amazing well paying job, handsome, hard work ethic, wonderful with my son, had an adorable dog, it all seemed too good to be true. In hindsight, there were a lot of red flags I acknowledged and ignored because I couldn't imagine having to worry about anything with him. About two weeks into getting to know each other, I opened up and just pretty much vented to him about my shitty situation and how I was barely making rent each month and he offered me to stay with him \\*Just until I could find childcare\\* so I could go back to working full time (as I was on mat leave and thats why I was struggling with bills) and so it wasn't really moving in together, it would just be temporary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, being someone who has never made very good choices, I did. One month in. Cue binge drinking, gas lighting, extreme insecurity issues, emotional/mental abuse, narcissistic all at once. I made it 4 months with him, almost 5. My son went to his fathers for the night, we had a talk about our relationship being where it is and I told him I was unhappy and wanted to move out. At this point, I should mention I was lucky enough to get accepted into the government funded PSW program and I am due to start on May 10th. He said I could stay until done school. I told him I would think about it but couldn't see it working. He got drunk, drank for 20 hours straight. 4 hours into it he was telling me to get out of his house, then begging for me to fix our relationship. Back and forth between extremes and it was terrifying. While I had no fear that he would physically harm me, the things he was saying and the arguing and begging for him to leave me alone sent me into a panic attack. My son couldn't come back to this home. I dealt with my panic attack, and packed everything myself and my son own. I fed and gave water to my cats, and called the women's crisis line and they immediately got me into a motel until I could get a covid test. I took 5 of those reusable shopping bags packed full of random shit, and left everything and made it to the hotel and then my son's father dropped him off to me there once I unpacked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe got our covid tests done today (I barely felt it, my son who gave the doctor a look of absolute disdain afterwards would tell you otherwise if he could talk) and they came back negative within hours. We are in this motel one last night, tonight, and we go to a transition house in the morning. I never thought I'd end up here. I've always had some place to call me own, or a place with room mates, or boyfriends, etc.. I've always had somewhere to turn to. My parents can't help. I have just a few friends and none that are able to help. I do have a few options as to what to do with my cats (a few friends offered to keep them temporarily, or I can board them). But all in all, I just feel like a failure. I let myself get to a point where I really couldn't even provide a safe roof over my son's head. The most basic of necessities and I couldn't do it. I'm sitting here in this motel suite with tears pouring down my face, with my thankfully happy go lucky oblivious son sleeping soundly in a playpen in the adjacent room, completely unaware that my whole world is falling apart and I'm trying to so hard to hold it together for him. I don't want to give my son a childhood he has to recover from, and so far, he's 14 months old and has seen me through two shitty relationships, 4 moves, and now into a place that's not even going to be 'home' for us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so sad. I feel pathetic. I know they have shelters to provide help when it's needed, but I just never assumed I'd ever be in a situation to need one. I am scared to go under a roof with strangers, all my belongings and my cats are still with my unstable ex and with covid protocols (we are currently under a lockdown) I'm not sure if I'll be able to leave to make arrangements to get everything out of there. I will most likely have to give up on my schooling because even though it's online, I'd need childcare 6-7 hours a day to be able to do it. I feel like the worst mom ever. I can't even look in the mirror, I'm so disappointed in myself. My son gave me purpose. No matter how awful my depression got, I could at least go to bed each night knowing my son gives me purpose and I will always get through anything for him. I was on a good path, about to begin school so I could have a real, stable job with benefits and it all blew up in my face. I have barely slept in 3 days, I hate myself, and I am so scared of what is to come. The staff had been so kind so far, and I hope I will at the very least be comfortable. I need help with counselling, getting childcare, getting on social assistance and finding geared to income housing and I know that they have access to all those resources and at the end of the day, if I never want to end up in this spot again, I need to take the help that's given to me and use it to my advantage. To swallow my pride and do what I am terrified of doing because I hope the suffering will help me come out better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all, I guess. If you managed to read through the whole thing, thank you for hearing out my scream into the void.",

    "text": "My rapist and his professional bluegrass musician girlfriend are using her social capital to silence me after I went to the police. I feel like I've failed SA victims. CW: Rape, physical assault, cyberbullying/letters/phonecalls, suicide attempt, false arrest, probably other triggers so please take care - \n\nI'm putting the TL;DR at the top because I basically wrote a novel.  If you read any of this, I'm really grateful.  I wanted to get this out in a safe environment, as I haven't been able to discuss it with many people. \n\nTL;DR - after I was raped by my 'friend' and former teacher,  I warned his new professional bluegrass musician girlfriend (a recent divorcee with three young children) about his treatment of women and his substance abuse. I suggested she encourage him to get therapy and substance abuse treatment. She said he was the most compassionate guy she'd ever met. \n\nWhen she later found out I was speaking to the police about her boyfriend raping me from a third party,  she created a couple of facebook posts that utilized her cachet as a public figure to doxx me, discredit my claims, have her fans harass my family and their business via every means possible, and have me removed and ostracized from the community.  After seven months of no contact, she baited me into talking about the rape by messaging me and appealing to common experience.  She then used that message along with fabricated and altered evidence to have me arrested on a charge of computer harassment.  \n\nOnce the case was dropped by the state,  I sent an email regarding what happened using pseudonyms for all involved to bluegrass community leadership in an attempt to convince them to hire a third party safe venue/ victim advocate who could establish standardized protocols to deal with harassment and sexual assault.  The girlfriend addressed her followers on facebook again,  this time directly stating I was lying about the rape and abuse, and that my actions diminished the efforts of 'real' victims.\n\nI feel like a worthless failure. I wasn't able to really help anyone.  I constantly wonder if she,  the rapist, and her fans are right and I should just finish it off and be silent forever.  It hurts every day that the rapist and his friends continue to run around, emboldened and vindicated in their behavior.  I worry for my niece,  my cousins,  and my friends' little ones.  I'm terrified about having a child and having to raise them in this area, as my rapist is still nearby.  I don't want to bring them into a world of rapists like 'Ted',  vindictive, faux feminist rape apologists like 'Rita', hypocritical BE KIND types,  and all the other malevolent beings like cops who kill Black folks over tail lights and the never ending stream of sex pests in positions of authority.\n\nDid I do everything I could? Did I help or hinder the progress of sexual assault advocacy? I'm afraid other victims will be scared to speak up seeing what happened when I did. I want so badly to help other victims, and to prevent this from happening to anyone else. \n\nI hate myself.  I'm worthless.  That's why I've been raped twice and thousands of people have said I deserve to be beaten and to disappear. I wish I had done more to mentally protect myself from a predator like Ted, and I blame myself for what happened.  \n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter moving to a new area far from my hometown,  I started banjo lessons in July 2018 as an avenue to make friends.  I asked my teacher, Ted, to help me find jams and such to join,  which is typical in bluegrass/ old time music as they are based on community participation.  At this time, I also admitted I had issues making friends because I'm scared of men after being raped when I was 20. I brought this up because most jams are almost exclusively attended by men. As he was a teacher,  I figured he was trustworthy. He invited me and some other students out to events after that.\n\nI changed teachers after six months because Ted wasn't an engaged instructor. I stopped speaking with him at this point. About two months later, he messaged and asked if I wanted to be friends. He also offered to help me integrate into the community.  At the time,  my partner and I were separated,  so I was happy to accept any help. I did ask my parents what they thought about Ted's invitation.  My dad was emphatically against the idea,  stating he didn't think Ted was being honest about his intentions. I thought it would be okay,  since he was vetted to teach lessons to children at the community center and seemed well known by the local bluegrass group.\n\nIn our initial meeting as peers, Ted opened by saying 'I was born to be given away.' Even though I loathe him,  I won't elaborate on that point other than to say I think it forms the basis of his issues. He told me he didn't have a lot of friends who were women,  so he was happy to talk to one so he could 'explore his feminine side.' He also spent a lot of time talking about his wife, Loretta. He wanted advice regarding her 'nagging' when it came to his drug and alcohol use around her son,  his jealousy over her male friends, and her suspicions he cheated on her. He also thought she lied about being sexually assaulted and wanted to know why someone would do that. He talked about his time in New Orleans,  and how he discovered he had the ability to turn his emotions off at will. There was also a discussion where I talked about how I had difficulty fitting in with most groups.  He said that other folks are 'shadow people'. I replied that I personally consider it important to never elevate myself,  or to 'other' people,  because that's how violence, bigotry,  and fear are sown. He hastily agreed.\n\nWhen I messaged him later to give him the requested advice on how to improve the relationship with his wife,  he said i misunderstood him. He claimed they were divorced and he was never going back.\n\nThe next time I saw Ted,  he kissed me.  He immediately pulled back and stated he didn't want a relationship,  but that we could be friends and he could help me.  I didn't consider myself emotionally  available,  but I did want his assistance in the community. We discussed it a bit more. The terms included that he'd continue sleeping with other people,  but that he'd practice safe sex and be respectful of me. I also begged him to not mistreat me in light of my prior rape experience. We then had sex.\n\nThe next time we had sex,  he did something that frightened me.  While I was on top,  he grabbed me by the throat and propelled me into the air.  He's at least 6' and stocky. I'm a little over 5' and small.  I immediately asked him to stop,  and told him it reminded me of my rape.  He then covered my face with his large hand,  but I managed to move off of him.  Afterwards,  he asked me to tell him about the rape.  I did so,  while crying in his arms.  I particularly emphasized how the rapist held me down by the throat. He became aroused.  Then,  he left. \n\nWe continued a routine of going to shows or jams on the weekend,  then having sex. He wouldn't speak to me during the week.  He made a point of never saying goodnight when I said it as we'd leave. He discussed his desire to move within the next year to be around the young college musicians in Tennessee. He hated being in the area around the 'inferior' musicians,  although he felt some obligation towards his parents to stay close by. He lamented that the band he'd been in in high school almost 'made it' . He said he was glad I wasn't like his crazy ex partners.\n\nI responded that he could teach students and raise them to his level.  I noted the other local musicians were well loved,  because they're affable and relatable and art is more than technical proficiency.  Just ask Johnny Cash.  I pointed out young people tend to prefer playing with each other, but that I thought a move might benefit him.  I wish I'd said more about the 'crazy' partners.  It was an ill portent.\n\nA couple of weeks later,  he left for a few weeks to go on tour.  I messaged him, and asked if he'd let me know how it was going and try to respond on occasion.  He sent back a diatribe telling me it wasn't my place to ask anything of him since we weren't dating,  and threatened to cut off our arrangement if I didn't behave.\n\nWhen I saw him again,  he was different.  Although he'd never been a particularly well groomed or emotionally responsive person,  he had clearly atrophied more in this regard. He was almost an hour late to the venue.  He explained that he started drinking at work,  then picked up more beer at the 7-11, then continued to drink at home until he passed out.  He relayed this while sitting there with disheveled, unwashed hair. Alcohol,  body odor,  cigarette smoke, and weed dankness wafted off him in an almost tangible entity.\n\nHe told me about his trip.  He spent the entire time microdosing shrooms along with his usual drinking and heavy marijuana use. He spoke of using cocaine to stay awake while driving.  He talked about how amazing it was to be out there with a band with whom he had a compatible vibe.  He mentioned sleeping with other women,  patronizing sex workers at the clubs and why he enjoyed it,  and how he wanted to cast or carve a statue of his penis.  He loathed being back, and whined again about the area and having to play with local musicians again.\n\nLater,  while having sex,  Ted said some creepy things,  like that I looked like a teenager.  I asked him if that was supposed to be a positive,  given we are both in our 30s. He enthused that it certainly was. I mentioned how I do not feel like an attractive person.  He pointed out the guys who talked to me at the venue. I could tell he was upset about them. He talked about how he fantasized about me when I was his student. Then, during sex,  he did the choke propel move again.  I grabbed his hand and reminded him why I didn't like it. \n\nThe next day and morning, June 28/29th 2019, are the ones seared into my memory.  I arrived at the venue around 9 PM. He came to say hello a while later before wandering off to drink and talk.  After the show,  I mostly talked to his band leader, Mop. This was typical of our outings as I was trying to make friends and we were avoiding looking like a couple.  We left the venue after midnight and went to a parking lot for a trailhead.\n\n\\*\\*\\*DESCRIPTION OF THE RAPE AHEAD\\*\\*\\* \n\nThe liaison started normally.  We were in the front of the vehicle,  then we moved to the back.  As he lived with his parents and I was living with my former partner until I saved enough money,  we typically used my vehicle.  Usually we would put  the back bench to make room.  This time,  he seemed to be in a hurry. He didn't put the bench down. He didn't remove his filthy boots.  Instead,  he pulled his pants off over them. We were making out on the right side of the bench when he said 'I just want to be inside you.' I moved to sit on the left side of the bench while he positioned himself in front of me in the foot well. Suddenly,  he grabbed my throat again.  I said,  \"please, no,  stop!\" Then, as I tried to say more, I blacked out.\n\nWhen I rejoined the world,  he was removing himself from inside of me.  He was acting strangely,  so I asked,  \"are you okay?\" He moved to the other side of the bench.  My legs were painfully arranged.  One was propped up on the driver's seat in front of me. The other was twisted out to the side.  My left hip was ground into the door molding.  I had difficulty moving.  Everything hurt. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI knew something wasn't right. But I cuddled him,  and convinced myself it was all okay. I hate myself for that, but it was one of the few times he let me touch him.  He said he had to leave because he was taking band photos in a few hours.\n\nI was disoriented and attempted to find my clothes. After rearranging myself,  he offered to have me follow him back to town.\n\nHe'd never offered anything like that to me before.\n\nAfter we parted paths,  I pulled over and cried. \n\nWhen I got back to the house,  it was later than usual.  My former partner,  Arthur,  came out and asked if everything was okay since I was coming in so late.  Arthur knew that I had been attending events with Ted. He noticed I was crying and that my neck was red.  He asked if I was okay, and if I needed help, or to go to the hospital.\n\nI declined,  and ran to shower.\n\nThe next day,  I found bruises all over myself.  They were concentrated on my left hip and all over my thighs,  but especially up near my crotch.  I also found bruises all over my right arm.  Scratches had formed on my right thigh.  I remembered that I had asked Ted about his usually long nails that were only on his left hand,  the one he used to fret the fiddle.  For the non musicians,  nails inhibit playing string instruments,  especially violins and fiddles. I took pictures of every injury I could find.\n\nAfter that night,  Ted mostly stopped talking to me.  I sent a message asking for his phone number,  which he ignored.  I saw him at a couple of events. When I tried to talk to him about what happened,  he'd ignore me and say he was going through a difficult time after the trip.  Online,  I asked him what had happened that night.  I pointed out he was being even more angry than usual,  and drinking heavily.  I was trying to get answers for something my mind was keeping from me. I didn't want to believe that after the times I talked about the issues from the first rape; after I'd pleaded for him to treat me like person, and most of all,  given that I had told him NO three times when he grabbed my neck, that something atrocious had occurred.\n\nIn the middle of July,  he sent me a message saying a sea shanty night was happening nearby.  It was the first time since that night that he'd told me about any events. When I arrived,  he was there with other local musicians.  Some time later,  Rita appeared.  Rita is a professional banjoist.  I had followed her band page for some time.  She posted extensively about her life - she had shared custody of three kids,  she was recently divorced,  she loved to travel,  and she desperately wanted a boyfriend, judging by her mention of looking for a cute guy at every show and her time spent on okcupid in every single blog update.\n\nAs an aside,  I have no idea how Rita ended up there that night.  I suspect Ted invited her,  as it was a very small event with little advertising almost an hour from where Rita lives.\n\nI was excited to meet another woman banjoist.  Rita had been sitting in the corner alone,  so I went over and started talking to her. We discussed being woman banjoists.  I mentioned how I had been having a difficult time with sexism in the community.  She said there were creepy guys who messaged her,  but overall, she just rolled with it.  Ted started talking to her.  They discussed accounting, and which musicians they disliked.  One of the other musicians invited us back to his place.\n\nRita mostly stood around,  as did Ted.  I tried to keep conversation going.  At one point,  I did hear them talking about the banjo she loaned to Ted.  I was confused,  since they'd acted like they didn't know each other.  I sometimes wonder if they were secretly dating during the time that he allegedly raped me.  A girlfriend,  a friend with benefits,  women he slept with while out of town,  and a wife all at once.  At any rate,  the other guys started talking about no name girls - women that guys like Ted would chase out of the community after a few weeks, so it wasn't worth learning their name.  This caused me to launch into an invective about every woman being a person and how ridiculous it was to speak that way.  Rita and Ted said nothing.  I wasn't surprised about Ted,  but Rita often posted about being a feminist and an advocate for women in the bluegrass community. \n\nI gave Ted some herbs to help with his alcoholism when we were leaving.  I tried again to find out what happened.  He said he was tired and didn't want to talk about it.\n\nMy last attempt came a week later, on July 19, 2019.  After a show, I approached him in the parking lot while he was loading.  Everything I said,  he repeated back to me in a mocking tone.  I was speechless and crying. I asked, why? again and again.  A friend of ours, Benedict,  came up to say goodbye, then quickly left when he heard Ted's tone.  Then Ted said he had to go,  shoved me,  and hopped in his vehicle.\n\nI went home and messaged him again, asking what I had done to deserve his cruelty.  Then I blocked him.\n\nI unblocked him later and said that while I didn't understand his malevolence,  I was reliant on him and his help to make friends and move on with my life in the community.\n\nThat's when he told me he was dating Rita, and that he hoped he'd see me around on occasion.\n\nI may not have fully processed what he had done to me,  but I certainly wasn't going to let it happen to a vulnerable mother of three kids.  I know my life is worthless,  but I'll never stand by and let others be abused.\n\nI messaged Rita and told her what had happened - what I remembered.  I sent her screenshots of all the unpleasant,  abusive things he said. I pointed out disturbing things I'd noticed,  like how he enjoyed me looking like a teenager,  and his habit of offering 'lessons' to teenage girls,  but not teenage guys.  I told her about his substance abuse problems. I told her how he complained about his wife asking him to stop doing drugs and drinking around her child. Then I stated it clearly - before dating someone with small kids, he needed therapy for his issues with women and substance abuse.\n\nRita told me he was the kindest guy she'd ever met; a beacon in a sea of dickheads,  and that she'd never let him go.\n\nTed messaged me.  He finally answered my questions.  He said it was all consensual,  that nothing he did was premeditated, and that everything else was my fault.  He told me that everything I told Rita was untrue and disrespectful. He told me that I should expect sexual harassment because of the way I dress,  and the preponderance of men in bluegrass.  I told him I'd always prioritize women and children over men like him.  He told me I was awful and blocked me.\n\nRita messaged me with more questions.  I answered as best I could.\n\nTed unblocked me and told me if I didn't stop talking to Rita,  he would tell the entire community I was crazy and about everything I'd done.\n\nI emailed Rita and apologized for bothering her. I told her he was threatening me,  and that I didn't appreciate that.  I wished her luck.\n\nEarly in September,  I attempted to kill myself. I'd rather not elaborate on that.\n\nLater in September,  I went to a campaign event for one of the musicians that was running for the board of supervisors.  I had been volunteering for him since April.  The entire time,  I was terrified Ted would appear.  I started shaking and crying at one point.  Benedict was there and I told him some of what had transpired. I met him the next day to talk a bit more.  He revealed that Ted was still married,  but complained often about his wife's nagging.  Benedict also mentioned that a couple of months after Ted married,  he started cheating on her.  One affair started at the large annual festival that much of the community attended.  He estimated since then that 5 or 6 women had been around him,  then disappeared.  He tried to encourage me to continue participating in local bluegrass events. I told him I wasn't interested, as Ted scared me.\n\nI emailed Rita again, telling her everything I'd learned and emphasizing he needed help.  She wrote back and said he was 'safe'.\n\nThroughout the fall,  Arthur and I decided to try again.  We began going on dates.  He was there for me as I talked about what had happened,  and how I was feeling.  We agreed to go to couples' counseling.\n\nThe last time I contacted Rita and Ted was early in December 2019. I was doing poorly by this point.  I don't know what I expected.  I just wanted to be acknowledged as a human.\n\nIn January 2020, I was cleaning out my phone when I found the pictures I took after the assault.  That was when my brain unlocked and I remembered what happened.\n\nBy this point,  I hadn't slept well in months.  I was depressed and lethargic.  I realized I needed help,  but wasn't certain how to get it.  I also felt panicked that Ted was out there,  with no one warning the other women.\n\nI tried contacting some music organizations that I thought might be able to help with restorative or transformative justice,  but sexual assault was not their purview. \n\nI reached out to someone I thought might understand - his 'crazy' ex girlfriend, Patsy.  She told me what he had done to her,  which was chilling.  She mentioned he'd moved and was living by himself.  That information scared me because he'd talked about holding lessons at his place once he had one. She encouraged me to go to the police. \n\nI also messaged his wife, Loretta. She was upset because they were married when he was sleeping with me (and all the other women). I apologized,  because I really can't imagine how that felt.  I wish I had known he was married.  I hate that I hurt her.  She suggested going to the police and contacting the sexual assault center.\n\nI contacted them a few days before the one year anniversary of that night.\n\nEveryone should know about these sexual assault/ social justice centers.   RAINN keeps a searchable database of these centers. They offer free counseling to survivors of sexual abuse and it is \\*lifesaving\\*.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks of counseling with the director of sexual assault,   I decided it was time to speak to the Special Victims Unit.\n\nThe sergeant encouraged me to find corroborating witnesses. I emailed Patsy and asked if she'd be willing to speak to the police as well.\n\nShe said she would,  but that she'd like to speak to Ted first - she wanted to see how he'd react when 'confronted' with my allegation.  I asked her to be cautious, and to let the police handle it.  She said she'd already contacted a mutual friend - Finn, one of the other guys from their teenage band.\n\nThe next morning,  I found weird 'likes' on my public pictures.  I suspected something had been posted.  Sure enough, Rita had unblocked me and put up a Facebook post addressed to her friends and followers that doxxed me.  She named me,  gave all my online aliases and associated sites,  gave a physical description of me,  stated the general area where I live,  and mentioned I play banjo. In the comments, she also outed me as a queer woman. She added that I was a crazy stalker who was obsessed with her,  her children,  and her boyfriend Ted.  She asked everyone to watch out for me, and to ignore anything I said because I'm insane and dangerous.\n\nThe comments were filled with people offering to beat me,  drill holes in my head,  run me out of town physically and digitally,  and make me disappear.  She had about 6000 friends and followers.  In the regular world,  that isn't significant, but in an insular niche like bluegrass,  it's quite the reach.  Many people mentioned that they were looking for me and the places they'd seen me posting,  and asking questions about things on my profile.\n\nThe next morning,  Rita messaged me. She opened with, \" Hey OP, long time no talk!\" She said she vaguely knew what I had told Patsy and Loretta,  but that she needed to know about what he'd done for herself. She also said her 'good guy' radar was broken,  and she wondered when Ted would betray her. I told her I didn't feel comfortable speaking to her at that moment.  She said she got it,  then told me she'd had a rape experience of her own. She told me to get over it,  then blocked me.\n\nBenedict also texted me,  asking if I still lived in the area and whether or not I needed someone to talk to.  The last time I had spoken to him was November 2019. It was now the end of July 2020. I didn't answer his questions,  and talked blithely of banjo instead.\n\nIn August,  Rita released a song that I'll call 'Stray Cat.'. The lyrics described a cat who made women disappear and was overall an undesirable animal.  The singer fell in love with the cat anyway,  as it was meant to. My therapist said it was a new experience to hear about a love song about her patient's rapist on the radio.\n\nAfter recovering from the doxx post, I contacted the SVU detective and filed a report.  The detective looked over my photos and the messages and said,  'let's call this what it is - rape.' It was the first moment I truly internalized what had happened that night.  She said it was unlikely the DA would pursue my case without the rape kit and confession.  After Rita's post,  I knew it was pointless to attempt to try and get a confession. It was likely Ted had hired a lawyer,  and no one in the community would want to help - they wouldn't want to face the same ire. The detective said the file would be there if anything else happened,  and that there was no statute of limitations. She asked if I was living alone,  and made certain I had been speaking to the counselors at the rape crisis center.\n\nA couple of weeks later,  I started to feel guilty that I hadn't answered Rita. I decided to email her and let her know what had happened. My partner,  the director of sexual assault at the crisis center,   and my mom advised against this.  They said she was dangerous.  I felt like it was hypocritical to claim to be an advocate for the safety of women while denying an earnest request like Rita's, particularly with her mention of a rape experience.\n\nI told her what happened,  and what the police said.  I told her I wasn't a sage,  but that his past behavior indicated an undesirable outcome for anyone involved with him.  I said there wasn't anything else I could do,  and that I wanted to heal and move on.\n\nI also copied a bluegrass advocacy organization on the email, at the request of my partner. \n\nRita responded by saying 'YOU AGAIN!' I sent a screenshot of her message asking about the rape and replied something like, 'I'm not trying to incite distress. I just wanted to answer your question'. She then said,  'thanks,  this will be useful in the defamation suit (winking kiss emoji)'.\n\nTwenty minutes later,  she called my parents. She called again later that evening.  The next day, she called their house four times from 9 AM until 11 PM. She also called my dad's shop several times.  My brother answered once and told her to stop calling.\n\nThen came the Facebook posts.  She picked people who had liked a picture on my mom's profile. Anyone with a public post received a rambling comment. They were all different.  Some of them said I was an unhinged, obsessive stalker.  Some of them said I was mentally ill and needed help.  They all said she was trying to contact my parents. \n\nNext she tried my dad's business FB page.  This was the first time she brought up a bizarre story about kayaking near my house after the July Facebook post and how her tire was slashed. She posted a picture of her son changing a tire and added they were 'just normal folks. '\n\nShe then started emailing my dad.  She sent all the messages I'd sent her from Ted.  She sent the slashed tire photo (which my dad,  who is an auto mechanic,  said looked very suspicious given how clean it was). She went on and on about how I'd been harassing her for over a year and I needed to stop.\n\nMy dad didn't know about the rape.  My mom knew,  but we decided not to tell him because we knew he'd be upset.  After all,  he was the one who mentioned that Ted seemed untrustworthy.  He called me about all the messages and I told him what had happened.\n\nNot long after this,  Ted himself emailed my dad.  He claimed we'd been in a romantic relationship,  and that I was lying about being raped.  He sent a screenshot of a lawyer contract and the same messages I'd sent to Rita. He told my dad he wasn't a scammer, and that he could be trusted because his girlfriend is a prominent professional banjoist,   and that my dad should Google her.\n\nThe following day was the start of the letters.  Rita sent four letters, two to my parents and two to my partner.  They all had a different tone.  One that was sent to my mom ended with 'you need to stage an intervention.  Send your daughter to an asylum! She cray! (Hand drawn spinny eyes emoji).' My partner's letters all referred to how Ted and I were 'fuck buddies' and I was exacting revenge with a false rape allegation.  Two of the letters were printed packets of the messages I'd sent her.  They had annotations in her hand writing indicating how I couldn't have been raped. \n\nOn September 22, she put up a Facebook post that tagged my father's business.  It had links to his Facebook reviews and Google reviews.  The post detailed how I harassed her and Ted for a year,  and how terrified she was.  She said the police could see I was insane, but since I never threatened anyone physically,  they couldn't do anything.  She also noted that as poor musicians in a pandemic,  they couldn't hire a lawyer.  She said the police suggested reaching out to my family.  She asked her followers to address them at the business site.\n\nMy dad's pages started to receive negative reviews.  His inbox filled up with messages about his crazy,  pig fucking daughter.  I made certain to screenshot everything as usual,  and kept deleting and blocking as necessary.\n\nOn Rita's post,  the usual battery of threats were expressed.  Rita encouraged anyone who offered to leave a negative review or send a message.  Rita updated the post to add a Yelp link. By 5 pm or so,  the post disappeared.\n\nI thought someone must have talked some reason into her about harassing a random business 300 miles away.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nAt 10 PM, a pounding came at my door.  We were terrified,  as we thought it was Rita or one of her violent fans coming to take us out. Arthur looked out the window and said,  'it's the sheriff. '\n\nThey'd come to arrest me,  on a warrant for one count of computer harassment, sworn out from Rita's town.\n\nI've already mentioned being raped twice.  To lose control of your body like that is a shock from which you'll never truly recover.  We all walk around with this illusion of autonomy. That it can be violated so easily permanently alters your sense of self.\n\nBeing arrested is a similar feeling.  Two men,  each far larger than me (I'm a little over 5' and 115 lbs) removed me from my safe spot, handcuffed me,  bent me over a car, and slid their hands between my legs. \n\nThankfully,  the sexual assault therapist had given me some tools.  I cast my mind far away while those strange men touched me. \n\nI was released a few hours later as I have no record and behaved properly. \n\nThe next day,  I was served a Cease and Desist from Ted.  It said I had an unhealthy obsession with him after being turned down,  and was also taking my ire out on Rita.  It stated that my rape allegation was defamation per se, and that I needed to stop because Ted's wish had been to help me integrate into the community.\n\nTwo days later,  we met up with my lawyer,  Boone.  After seeing all my evidence,  he was baffled as to why I was arrested.  We went to get the statement from the courthouse.  Rita had written that I had been harassing her constantly from July 2019 to September 2020, even though the last time I had messaged her unprompted was December 2019. She claimed to have told me to stop contacting her three times. She mentioned the mysterious slashed tire. She said I had just come up with a false rape allegation against her boyfriend.  She wrote that I was a threat to her and her children.\n\nA couple of weeks later,  we received her deposition packet.  The messages I sent her in July 2019, the September 2019 email,  and the September 2020 email were there,  but the dates were not included.  An email that I had never seen,  supposedly from Ted to myself, was there.  It was dated December 2019, but had a caption that it was generated in July 2020. The email was a request for me to stop speaking to both of them.  There were no email addresses,  and several different fonts were used.  After an expert looked it over, it was decided that it was quite probably fraudulent.  There were screenshots from a conversation between Loretta and Ted,  where she talked about what I'd said.  She claimed she deleted the actual messages. Ted also wrote a letter to an unspecified person asking for a protective order against me due to my 'unhealthy obsession' with him.\n\nIt was my turn. I brought my lawyer a hard drive with over 500 files.  I included the full,  unexpurgated Facebook messenger logs with Ted and Rita. I made certain that dates and times were present.  I had screenshots of all her Facebook posts,  and every single threatening response in the comments.  I brought my own copies of the emails.  I had phone logs.  I included all the people I had told about Ted's violence,  starting in September 2019. I brought the letters and packets. Most importantly,  I connected everything to a timeline.\n\nBoone was confident my case would be dismissed.  In December 2020, he walked with me to the judge and said, 'no deal!' A trial was set for February 3, 2021.\n\nWe met with Boone the Monday before the trial.  The offer he had turned down - without even relaying it to me - was a $1000 fine and a mental health evaluation by the court.  We prepared the timeline and all the documents Rita didn't submit,  particularly the message where she asked for me to speak to her about Ted.\n\nThe next day,  the DA offered a new deal. If I pled guilty,  there'd be no trial.  I refused.  The third offer they sent said if I never spoke to,  or about,  Rita AND Ted ever again,  the case would be dismissed in a year.  I let my lawyer know I'd NEVER be silent about what Ted did. I was LIVID at the suggestion and cried with the frustration of rapists being protected. My lawyer called back and said the DA had finally agreed to drop the case via nolle prosequi. Boone emphasized that it was rare for the state to drop a case.\n\nAt court the next day,  the DA called me up and began speaking before I even made it to the podium.  He said 'nol prosse' then began to rant about how 'it was so close ' and that I needed to 'leave Ms. Rita alone'. The judge looked at the complaint and said,  \"there must be more to this case than what's on this paper,  Ms. OP. You're free to go.\"\n\nI knew that moment was the closest I'd get to pitting my word against theirs.  I am thankful I was acknowledged by both the SVU and the court. \n\nArthur and I wanted to do one last thing.  In therapy,  I discussed how much I wanted to change the culture of the bluegrass community,  and how I could help.  We decided to send an email to people in bluegrass leadership and advocacy positions to ask them to hire a victim and safety advocate for their professional branch,  the International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA). I suggested that this person could come up with standardized protocols and safety training for events and venue sponsored by the IBMA. I included links to other genres' efforts.  I talked about what had happened to me,  and included screenshots of the threats and harassment I'd received from IBMA members at Rita's behest. I mentioned Daisy Coleman,  and how the kind of community bullying she and I were subjected to drives people to suicide and suicide attempts.  I made certain to use pseudonyms for Rita, Ted, and myself as I didn't want to doxx them or revert too much focus from my request.\n\nA week later,  my brother showed me a post that was tagged with the shop. It was Rita.  She wrote about how I lied about being raped by Ted; that he was kind and gentle with her and her children.  That she'd read the messages he sent me (the ones he said were deleted in her deposition) and they were also kind and gentle. She said I was spiteful and jealous,  and that my actions were mitigating the validity of other sexual assault victims. She then said they'd find the strength to forgive me somehow.  The post ended with a horrid song she'd written. My brother summarized her post as 'an asshole trying to gaslight you.' He also said, 'let's see her write songs saying 'get over it' when he comes home drunk and gives her a black eye or AIDS!'\n\nI talked to a lawyer at this point. I wasn't particularly interested in a lawsuit. I wanted legal conflict resolution.  He said he could take my case,  but that due to Rita's animus,  he doubted she'd want to negotiate civilly.  He said the rape would mean a jury would rule in my favor if it went that far,  but that she'd probably keep appealing.\n\nI didn't feel like spending the time, money,  or emotional energy on those two.\n\nAs a last recourse, Arthur sent Rita a message. He told her he believed me, and that he was proud of all I had done and how far I'd come. He said that 'consent given once is not constant consent. ' He let her know he had read all of the messages himself.  He mentioned seeing me that night,  and how he wanted to take me to the hospital after seeing my neck and how he regretted not forcing me into it.  In light of that,  he asked her to take the post down, and to never contact or harass us,  our families,  our friends,  or any associated businesses ever again. He also specified she should stop using her social capital to catalyze her fans' harassment of us.\n\nShe blocked him and kept the post up.  Ted took it down.\n\nSince that time,  which was the beginning of March,  I've continued to focus on recovery. I've been feeling better but...\n\nIt shatters my heart that my attempts to improve a culture that supports sexual violence have now been weaponized.  I'm afraid other survivors will see Rita's posts and be afraid to speak up.  Arthur thinks their intention was to harass and humiliate me until I killed myself. I think he's right.  Who would want to subject their family and themselves to all that?\n\nI'm such a failure.  I wish I had done more,  and sooner.\n\nI'm disillusioned by the fact that the person who tried to destroy me was another woman.  A woman I tried to help. It devastates me that a community based on love and peace; one that slaps BE KIND stickers everywhere and has social media profiles covered in image macros about empathy viciously attempted to destroy me,  my family, and their business.  All for an alcoholic,  wife abusing,  girlfriend stalking,  date rapist. I feel like I'm living in a black mirror episode,  where everyone calls victims 'psychotic monsters' and elevates violent perpetrators.\n\nI don't regret going to the police.  I just..I don't even know how to think or feel outside of that at the moment.  I'm simultaneously a cipher and overloaded with every emotion out there.\n\nI'm thankful for so much in my life. My partner is fantastic. I have had a lot of support during the healing process. I live in a beautiful, tranquil area. I'm trying to improve and get to the point where I can truly make a change and help others. I really want to start a therapy farm and a therapy music jam. \n\n Still, I struggle every day and I worry I can't escape.",

    "text": "Sexual Harassment at Cafe Zupas I had to leave my last job recently because it's not a safe place for women. I was supposed to go in for my last check two weeks ago and I just haven't been able to bring myself to do it.\n\nA male employee was transfered to our store some months ago, and right off the bat starts harassing one of the young women that works in the mornings. He also makes misogynistic comments every chance he gets and it drives me crazy. I asked my coworker if I could talk to my boss about the things this employee was saying to her and she says yes. The next day, my boss holds a sexual harassment meeting (which I learned later that this employee wasn't even entirely apart of because he was late)\n\nShortly after sexually harassing his coworker, this employee is given a promotion and a raise. He is a manager now.\n\nHis harassment moves to the teenagers and young adults that work in the evening, when my boss or myself aren't around. He focuses in on two young girls in particular and, while they're not uncomfortable, it makes everyone else around them wildly uncomfortable and that itself is sexual harassment.\n\nSo months after he harasses the first girl, I hear one of the male employees that work at night call him the \"workplace creep\" and I start asking around to see whats going on. Most of the girls have something to say about how he treats them in a demeaning way, or how they feel weird about him flirting with other staff and customers. Then he takes it upon himself to save one of the girls 18th birthdays in his phone, and that's when I talk to my boss about it. He said, \"I thought we were over this.\"\n\nYeah, I wish the problem was solved the first time too!!\n\nMy boss loves this guy. Every time I try to talk to him about the situation he interupts and talks over me to tell me about how, \"Yeah, sometimes it can be inappropriate to save your coworkers birthdays\" and that he has the right to defend himself. I know he does, never once have I said he doesn't!\n\nIt's made blatantly obvious I'm the one who reported him. And after my boss tells me several times that this manager isn't allowed in the store until things are settled, he shows up to my closing shift with his friends.\n\nThe same day i am told over and over again that he won't come into the store he comes into my shift. \n\nThey sit at a table for me to see, they take desserts from the fridge to eat in the kitchen. I text my boss about him coming into my shift over and over but he doesn't text the manager to leave until I tell him that he's distracting the staff and I can't get them to focus on closing \n\nI fought back tears my whole shift and I was scared to walk back to my car at the end of the night, the whole experience felt very threatening and intimidating. I didn't know what to do and I feel like shit for not protecting these kids and letting him talk to them\n\nI call my district manager who was on vacation, and had no idea and of this was happening, and when he gets back we have a meeting and I tell him everything.\n\nA week goes by. And we have another meeting. They sit me down (and another girl, a shift lead that works at night and has also come forward about how this manager makes her and other staff feel) and they tell us that they're keeping him employed because \"it's important that he is given all of his opportunities\"\n\nI asked if they were keeping him manager, and they told me it's none of my business.\n\nThe most upset they seemed over this entire situation, their manager harassing the entire staff, was when i told them that he gave free food to attractive female customers\n\nRumor has it. This manager already has 18HR reports- and the reason he was transfered to our store was because he accidentally gave a woman a black eye. And now he's being transfered to another location, where he can harass an entirely new group of unsuspecting women and girls.\n\nToday I need to go in for my check. I left because of this, the girl that came forward with me has left, the first girl he harassed months ago has left, all after learning that they're keeping him employed. I wish we could have been given the same opportunities that it's so important that that manager received\n\nEdited for typos",

    "text": "3 Sisters, An abortion Story This is a true story and I'm sharing it in light of all the mind fuckery going on in the States right now. First off, This takes place in Western Canada over the span of two years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThree Sisters, all born two years apart. 23, 21, 19.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey never really had what you would call a good upbringing. Their Grandfather had repeatedly molested all three of them as young children. Their father was emotionally absent until their parents marriage disintegrated, and then was physically absent as well. Their mother was an alcoholic. All three of these girls spent a lot of time and effort trying to create the family they desperately wanted but didn't have. And being young and stupid, you know what that means. First relationships with inappropriate men and then babies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe eldest daughter, she got pregnant when she was 19. She decided that her high school sweetheart and her needed to have a baby. So she just stopped taking her birth control pills without telling him. Baby was born two months after the mother's 19th birthday, and the parents were married in a backyard ceremony a month after that. Within a year, the mother had caught an STD because her unemployed, severely arthritic husband (he had a really nasty case of arthritis that hit him at an early age, he was only 2yrs older than her) was cheating on her. Then she cheated on him with his best friend, left him for the best friend, and proceeded to recreate the fiction of her life like he never existed and the best friend was the father of all her children, present and future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Middle daughter had arguably been abused the worst because she was \"Grandpa's favourite\". At the age of 15, she had dropped out of high school and was shacking up with a 25yr old pizza delivery driver. She did lots of drugs, thankfully never became addicted to any. Broke up with the weird ass grown man, moved to a small town where her mother was living, and tried to restart her life. She briefly reattended high school, only to drop out again. Randomly decided that she liked the look of a baby a fellow coke head had with a 30+ old guy. She got in the middle of that marriage, broke them up. She was pregnant and shacked up with the guy by the time she was 20. What nobody knew at the time, and for years afterwards, was not only was the guy beating the shit out of her almost daily, so was the guy's father.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe youngest daughter was a weird and goofy kid that nobody had really ever noticed. She stayed clear of the party crowd, unlike her sisters. And because she had all these romantic notions that life should be like a teen romance movie, she managed to steer clear of pervy old guys. However, her dad was a mental case that used to tell her she was fat and nobody would ever find her attractive (She wasn't but he was dating an anorexic stripper so what did he even know), so she had a lot of issues. Depression, a compulsive eating disorder that the anorexic stripper used to make fun of her about all the time, and she was very shy and awkward. She would beg her parents to let her take high school via correspondence school, but in the words of her mother, her issues were social so she had to go to school in person. So instead, she just started skipping until she was expelled. She also used to hang out with the druggies/smokers but wasn't one herself and that's how she met her first boyfriend a few months before her 19th birthday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe youngest thought she was in love. She up and moved to a remote part of the country, to his home town, and away from anyone she knew. There he slowly pawned off anything she had of value for drug money. His psycho family sabotaged any time she ever had a job interview, and by the end of that summer she was living in a black mold infested motel turned apartment, pregnant, and living on Welfare. But you know, it was ok. She was in love. She was going to have a baby. The dad was going to straighten himself out. They would get jobs. She would write a book. They would have a happy life with the baby. Everything was going to be ok.\n\nUntil she miscarried. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPregnancy was really hard on the youngest daughter. She threw up so much and so hard that she was bleeding from her vagina, onto the floor. The doctors wouldn't take her seriously. Her eldest sister called her up one day, raging at her because the girl's doctor hadn't checked to make sure the pregnancy wasn't a tubal pregnancy, which by this point the eldest sister had already had one of. The doctor assured the girl that it wasn't a tubal, that tubal pregnancies weren't hereditary, and the only way this could be confirmed was for the doctor to shove his hand up into her and physically feel her fallopian tubes, which hurt like a son of a bitch. She miscarried at 2 months, 2 weeks and sitting in the hospital, the ER doctor gave her a choice. She could either stay and have a D&C or go home and try to pass everything naturally. Alone in the hospital because her boyfriend had already fucked off to who knows where instead of mourning the loss with her, the girl chose to go home and pass it naturally but was warned. If she started soaking through more than 2 pads an hour, she had to come back to the hospital right away. She was bleeding to death. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSure enough, about 6hrs later, the girl was back at the hospital, having a D&C because indeed, she was hemorrhaging and bleeding to death. A D&C is one of the procedures used when you have an abortion and this procedure saved this girl's life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I would like to say the girl lived happily ever after, after kicking the druggie asshole to curb... but that didn't happen right away. Things are ok now, but mental health is still something she struggles with daily but I'm digressing in the story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile all this is going on, the middle sister is cheating on her common law husband. She finds out her little sister had a miscarriage and calls her in October, shortly before Canadian Thanksgiving. She tells her little sister that she's pregnant. That she cheated on her husband and is now pregnant. She will take her son and leave her husband if the little sister takes the new baby to raise. If the little sister does not take the baby, she will be having an abortion. The middle sister wants to leave her husband, but can't. Not with two kids, 2 and under. So that's why it's perfect the little sister had the miscarriage because now she can take the unwanted baby and middle sister wouldn't have to get an abortion. Youngest sister said no. The Middle Sister went ahead and had her abortion, stayed another 10+ years with her abusive husband, had another kid with him, and finally left him 10yrs ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe eldest sister now has 2 kids. 1 with her now ex husband, 1 with his ex best friend. When the eldest sister had left her ex husband, her mother-in-law took the eldest sister to court to get custody of the grandchild. Eldest sister easily won that court case, was awarded full custody of her daughter, and proceeded to cut that entire family out of her and the child's life. To the point that the child in question is now 30 and found out about her real father when she was 28. Anyways, the eldest daughter had the easiest time in life. She did manage to graduate high school. Her parents made sure she knew how to drive, gave her a brand new, paid off car. She was her father's favourite, so when she needed free childcare for when she was at work and when she wanted to go out to the bars and party it up, she told her dad, and her dad made her youngest sister do it for free. The new guy Eldest Sister was with, he was a college graduate. He was in the cell phone/tech industry and had gotten that education and employment right before the big boom in the 90s. He was rolling in the money. She worked, but she never really had to worry about what life was going to be like if she lost her job or something because she had him. Life was good. Until she had her first miscarriage prior to the start of this story. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTurns out, eldest sister is prone to tubal pregnancies. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout a year after the first two abortions/procedures, life is still going great for Eldest Sister. She's pregnant again, she has a nice house, another new vehicle, everything is taken care of. And this pregnancy is going to be the make up pregnancy for the one she miscarried 2yrs prior. Except, turns out this was yet again, another tubal pregnancy. This one, for whatever reason, just hadn't miscarried like the other one had. She was going to have to have an abortion or else the pregnancy was going to kill her. This was especially hard for the Eldest Sister as the Eldest Sister was very Pro-life/anti-abortion. Up until this point, she could never conceive of the slightest reason why anyone would have an abortion. Yet there she was, with the pretty black and white decision. Have an abortion or die. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe of course had an abortion. She got pregnant again in about 6 months after that. It was another tubal pregnancy and this time it took her fallopian tube. Down to only one tube, she was told her chances of conceiving again were pretty small. Fortunately not impossible though, as she did end up getting pregnant and having her last child 3 years after that. By the way, she's still a pro-life idiot, but mostly keeps that shit to herself. She's not down at the clinic protesting every Saturday. It did unfortunately cross over to her three daughters however. The Youngest sister, who practically raised the first two daughters as a teenager, did do her best to deprogram them as much as possible though. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo there we have it. 3 sisters, 3 abortions for 3 different reasons. All three times, that procedure saved those women's lives. 1 hemorrhaging to death, 1 probably would have been a domestic violence homicide, and 1 was growing a baby in the wrong organ. It is a medically necessary procedure and to think that like in the Eldest Sister's case where it was a tubal pregnancy, and could have killed her, that a doctor may not perform it because they can be sued? Or that the Middle Sister would have to go to court to defend her decision to have it done? It is infuriating. It is insulting. And it is depressing.\n\n(I am the youngest sister in this story)",

    "text": "Anonymous writings of a covid nurse - part 2 *One…two…three…four…five…six…seven….*\n\nIt takes me exactly three hundred and eighty-seven steps to walk the entire loop of my unit and arrive back where I started. I should know…I’ve counted it hundreds of times by now.\n\nBack in the days before when I could find the time, I would toss my Vocera at any willing coworker and meander around campus for fifteen minutes or so to get a break from the demands of being a bedside nurse. I’d wander outside to the employee patio and get a glimpse of the sky, sit next to the fountain, enjoy the sun a bit. Maybe pick my way through the gift shop and buy some trinket to bring home to my daughter. Sometimes I’d go visit my friends that had transferred to other floors. Such social calls were normal back then. It wasn’t always possible of course, but before all of this it was possible to find the time more often than it wasn’t.\n\nIt started with a single patient at first. Then it was two. Six. Fourteen. They’ll only be placed in negative pressure rooms, it was announced. That lasted for approximately five days. Then any positive case requiring less than six LPM were allowed in standard rooms. Thirty-five. We can handle it, our CEO proclaimed. There were plans in place. Fifty-three. Elective procedures were cancelled. PPE was short, you’ll need to reuse your N95. Place it in this brown paper bag and keep it on your iso carts. Nono, it’s perfectly safe, probably. Seventy-nine. Units were locked. Patient loads were getting top-heavy and cumbersome to manage. Incentive pay was announced. Then increased. Then increased again. One hundred and four. “Heroes work here” signs. Codes overhead every hour, the sickening feeling of ribs breaking under your hands. Exhaustion. Difficulty sleeping. Two hundred and twenty-two. So many stroke alerts. The sound of families sobbing over Zoom as their loved ones gasped their last breaths. Two hundred and fifty-four. Will this fucking pager ever *stop beeping.* Single rooms are now doubles, a Black Friday two for one. Two hundred and ninety-nine. Coworkers are getting sick at an alarming rate. Anna’s on the vent in MICU waitlisted to be transferred to a different facility for ECMO because we’re at capacity. Chris was just admitted, he’s on IMCU riding the vapotherm and looking like shit. Three hundred and thirty-one. Blistered feet. Nine days in a row and three more on the schedule. Crash intubation after crash intubation. The claustrophobic feeling of drowning in patients, tasks, and dexamethasone. Three hundred and eighty-eight. Bleeding cuticles, grinding teeth without noticing until your jaw aches. How can this continue? How can this…how….\n\n…\n\nAnd just when I thought this whole godforsaken house was about to collapse, it began to ease.\n\nI took to pacing my locked unit like a caged tiger after the last wave crested, turning corner after corner within the same four walls. There was still no time for campus walks anymore, and we were forbidden that sort of freedom of movement anyway. But by then it felt like a cardinal sin to sit down and do nothing. Returning to some semblance of normal didn’t quite feel normal to me yet. Instead, my usual fifteen minute cool-down period had turned into a way to expend bottled anxiety and energy.\n\n“Getting your steps in, Taylor?” my coworkers would ask.\n\nI’d fake a smile, nod, and keep going.\n\nTwo hundred and five. I cut down to a normal amount of overtime. One hundred and seventy-one. My arm hurt like a motherfucker after that vaccine. Ninety-eight. Electives resumed. Sixty. Floors were converted back to their original service designations. Fourty-four. My dad, full of optimism and synthetic mRNA, visited for the first time in eleven months. We drank a beer on the patio and laughed at the absurdity of the cardboard cutout fans in the stands of the game we were watching. Twenty-seven.\n\nIt’s oddly quiet around here now. The amount of emails I receive from administration have dropped off precipitously. During the surge, I would count the number of red-orange covid isolation signs taped to the doors on my daily prowls. At one point they adorned every single room.\n\nToday, I count three.\n\nIt feels as if the dust has settled a bit. The place looks normal but has the same palpable tension as an empty street, littered with the broken glass and spent tear-gas cannisters that inevitably follow a riot. We may have swept the debris into the gutters, but the memory of the event hangs in the air like the lingering scent of sulphur. The faces of my colleagues are no longer so worn. We’re all dealing with what we’ve seen in different ways. Some are dealing better than others. Some aren’t dealing with it at all. A stoic few deny there’s anything to deal with in the first place. This is what we do, they scoff. This is what we’re here for.\n\nI don’t know where I fall on this spectrum.\n\n“Try not to focus on all the lost causes,” my favorite tech instructs me after we rambled a bit on the topic at lunch. “I mean…have you thought about all the ones we saved?”\n\nI pause. It’s so easy to focus on the negative that I’m ashamed to admit I haven’t.\n\n“What about that one guy that was in bed 3 forever?” she continues. “You discharged him on New Year’s Day. He’d been on a vent for like two weeks. That was pretty amazing.”\n\nIt was, I agree.\n\n“And remember Mrs. Graham, or Garman, or…whatever her name was. She was here for over 90 days and walked out under her own power without oxygen.”\n\nI must have taken care of her at least a dozen times or better and I’d completely forgotten about her. Unbelievable.\n\nI spend the remainder of my two scheduled shifts catching my coworkers during lulls and asking them about their saves, too. Ashley tells me about Mr. Sacks who she discharged to LTACH. He’s walking now, she quips. Casey reminds me of another patient who was able to have their trach and PEG discontinued before leaving. That guy that had the stroke while SAPed? We thought he’d leave in a body bag but he’s back to work. And we all remember our most memorable case, a failed compassionate extubation that sent a freakin’ Christmas card to the staff after breezing through rehab.\n\nThe stories start piling up. Five. Twelve. Twenty-eight. I stop counting and catch myself smiling, feeling lighter than I have in a year.\n\nIt’s unrealistic to think that any of us will ever be exactly the same as we were before living through these times. God knows I won’t. But at least now, I can view these memories like a coin. One side contains all of the anger, the hurt, and the sheer misery that we were forced to stomach as we performed our duties. But the other? It holds the precious victories, the joy we saw on our patient’s faces as they left our facility. The times we went toe to toe with death and won.\n\nI’m back at work tomorrow morning. Maybe I’ll skip down to the fountain, take my mask off, and sit for a bit. It's past time to see if things still looks the same.",

    "text": "The USA's Status Quo Has Got To Go (And How You Can Bring Change) This is a message written to every physician, nurse, aide, tech, and (most importantly), patient.\n\n**TL;DR:** While practicing medicine in the US may equip you with some of the most advanced technologies and treatments available, there are a number of barriers that render these advances inaccessible to many of our patients.  I'm going to try to outline some of these areas of weakness, and close by summarizing steps we can take to fix our system *for our patients.* Change is going to take all of us.\n\n# High Cost But Poor Value: The US Healthcare System Today\n\nOur patients experience insufficient access to care.\n\n[The US spends a much higher percentage of its gross domestic product (GDP) on health care than other wealthy countries](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-271.html).  However, the US performs poorly on many quality measures compared to other countries, including avoidable hospitalizations and deaths.  Why practice medicine, if we can't *get access* to help our patients?\n\n On a per capita basis, the U.S. spends more than double the $3,453 average of all OECD countries.\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.dpeaflcio.org\\/factsheets\\/the-us-health-care-system-an-international-perspective](https://preview.redd.it/wi3ii0hlvle71.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=28b7b0793319f64994e52338060e34834c3157e9)\n\n[**Health care access, quality, cost, and outcomes vary** between different regions and states within the US.](https://www.medicare.gov/)  For example, [12 states did not expand their Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act of 2010](https://www.medicaid.gov/), creating a coverage gap for people in these states who do not qualify for either Medicaid or subsidies with the purchase of private health insurance. Further, [prices for an identical health care service can vary dramatically by region](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Healthcare-Financial-Management-Seventh/dp/1567937063). (Read about this USA Today article on the same care in [different states](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/01/health-exchange-prices/3797039/), as an example). There is [no universal health care coverage](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/international-health-policy-center/system-features/how-does-universal-health-coverage-work), and a [significant number of individuals do not have health insurance](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/pdf/265041/trends-in-the-us-uninsured.pdf). This disparity causes [earlier onset of illness, more severe disease, poorer quality of care, and a significantly reduced lifespan in those affected by poor social determinants of health.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425844/)\n\n# [Overall quality of care, by state, 2014-2015](https://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/nhqrdr/nhqdr16/overview.html)\n\n[ Some states in the Midwest \\(Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Wisconsin\\) and some in the Northeast \\(Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island\\) had the highest overall quality scores. Scores were based on the number of measures that were better, same, or worse than the national average for each measure. Many Southern and Southwestern states \\(Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia\\), several Western states \\(Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming\\), and one Midwestern state \\(Indiana\\) had the lowest overall quality scores.](https://preview.redd.it/cebbev6esle71.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fc8ec5045f8f8874cf462a1083d189f5cc8ce32)\n\n# [Average differences in quality of care for Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians compared with Whites, by state, 2014-2015](https://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/nhqrdr/nhqdr16/overview.html)\n\n[ Some Western and Midwestern states \\(Idaho, Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming and several Southern states \\(Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia\\) had the fewest racial and ethnic disparities overall. Several Northeastern states \\(Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania\\), some Midwestern states \\(Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin\\), one Southern state \\(North Carolina\\), one Southwestern state \\(Texas\\), and one Western state \\(Arizona\\) had the most racial and ethnic disparities overall.](https://preview.redd.it/giujjwfssle71.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6e0b7d0d79caec7788ef9565f9a2681ec2cf139)\n\nAccording to the [US Census Bureau reports](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-271.pdf) published in September 2020, 8% (26.1 million) of Americans did not have health insurance during 2019. 92% of Americans had health insurance coverage during 2019 (68% via private insurance, and 34.1% via public insurance). Now, [around 30 million people in the US remain uninsured](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/). Many more are underinsured, with [half of US adults reporting having delayed or skipped medical care due to costs.](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/)  Why? Well, for example... The average cost of an inpatient admission was [$25,000 in 2018](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/global-payments-to-health-providers.aspx). Common and essential drugs, such as insulin and epinephrine autoinjectors, can cost hundreds of dollars each. [Drug prices in the U.S. are twice as high as in other countries](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/prescription-drug-prices-in-the-u-s-are-twice-as-high-heres-why). Experts say brand-name drugs are the main driver of higher prices, and note that actual out-of-pocket costs is difficult to gauge. (This is beyond the scope of today's post).\n\n[ In 2015, the U.S. spent $325 billion on retail prescription drugs, equivalent to 1.8&#37; of GDP, or 10&#37; of total national health expenditures. Spending has grown considerably since the 1980s ](https://preview.redd.it/6hvld691tle71.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0da12f78ca2b33d95765e3d8da63099514c09e9)\n\n[The U.S. spends substantially more per capita than other countries. According to the OECD, the U.S. spent $1,112 on retail pharmaceuticals per person in 2014, while the next highest spender was Canada, at $772, followed by Germany at $741 and France at $659. ](https://preview.redd.it/hbb2lhh2tle71.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba1ef0ad5d392620caa5749cd09dcb2adcee6c0)\n\n[Source](https://www.bruegel.org/2017/08/the-issue-of-u-s-prescription-drug-prices/) \n\nPolicymakers aren't going to require changes without pressure from a coordinated movement.  You can use the [social determinants of health](https://www.cdc.gov/socialdeterminants/index.htm) as an example of how our system is failing. These political, cultural, and socioeconomic conditions into which individuals are born and with which they live impact health.  We have found that one's education, the environment, nutrition, wealth distribution, gender, race, and/or access to health care [are not very well addressed in the current system](https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/welcome-ad?toURL=/clinical-care/5-ways-healthcare-organizations-can-address-social-determinants-health). Do you know anyone affected by any of these?\n\n# The US population has a higher chronic disease burden than other 1st world countries, yet spends more money than other countries\n\n[https:\\/\\/mpkb.org\\/home\\/pathogenesis\\/epidemiology](https://preview.redd.it/dvmyxaixule71.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d943fec8695a704a17c6c7bb728e165320cecb0)\n\nHow embarrassing! US politicians, health care administrators, and investors are failing us. Most would argue that a just and equitable health care system benefits a society as a whole.  You can measure that by looking at chronic disease burden. How are we doing? \n\n[28% of US adults report](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-271.html) having been diagnosed with two or more chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) in their life, compared to an average of 18% of adults in other wealthy countries.  [This is a huge red flag about a failing system, but the causes are beyond the scope of today's post (you can read more about them here).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5876976/)\n\n[https:\\/\\/mpkb.org\\/home\\/pathogenesis\\/epidemiology](https://preview.redd.it/txbpns0evle71.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfa73dd0f49a3f8b08051eac456ad91c5ac19920)\n\nA just and equitable system ensures certain standards of public health that, in turn, [reduce the burden of disease on the entire population.](https://health.usnews.com/health-care/for-better/articles/the-case-for-universal-health-care) (This is [how universal health care pays for itself](https://www.healthcare-now.org/blog/how-single-payer-health-care-pays-for-itself/)). Accordingly, a health care system should strive to provide access and treatment to all population groups regardless of identity and socioeconomic status, while ensuring that underprivileged groups are not ignored.\n\nRecognizing and addressing inequalities due to social health determinants can improve the health of the most vulnerable and at-risk groups. For example, [social justice](https://www.apha.org/what-is-public-health/generation-public-health/our-work/social-justice) in health care is the delivery of high-quality and fair treatment, regardless of an individual's age, race, ethnicity, economic status, disability, or sexual orientation.\n\n# What can be done about all of this?\n\nThe most important step is to learn how our system (and specifically it's failings) are influencing the health of our patients.  We must acknowledge and address our role in changing it.  We need to look at how other countries allocate resources in ways that benefit more people (e.g., set up a budget inclusive of underserved populations). We need to provide training to ensure health care providers are culturally competent and advocate for patient rights.  We also need to create diverse care delivery models.\n\n# It starts with each of us.\n\n**You can** help fix the illogical things the USA is doing in medicine, medical education, and healthcare policy without sacrificing as much as you think. Where to start? Talk to each other. Share your goals, struggles, and challenges. Join together. Drop the poisonous attitudes, the fights, and the competition. Smell the roses. It just takes some common sense, optimism, communication, and compromise. It takes all of us working for our patients.\n\n**Today, I'm hoping to encourage all of you to** seek progress. We need to acknowledge this responsibility before things worsen. Perhaps you're discouraged, isolated, and overworked. You're not alone. We are waiting for others to fix medicine, but it's got to be us.  The status quo has got to go. How will you stand up to it?\n\n[Healthcare workers \\(and our patients\\) need to get more active in politics. ](https://preview.redd.it/c71gv3x4sle71.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f3e7ca0da93541a075af89a3210db36b8ccd43e)",

I’ve worked under some hokey executives who somehow see sigma six as a legitimate black belt and get their inspirational speeches from some cringey places, but this one took the cake for me. Maybe it’s cuz I was already tired and overworked, but I listened to a videoed staff meeting where one executive stated that people who say they’re realists are really pessimists and the only reason we’re stressed out and burned out is because we let the stress get to us negatively. No “we’ll help you manage the stress” or “here are some ways to mitigate stress,” nope. Just good ol’ “pull yourselves together and do the work and don’t complain.” (This of course came after someone complained.)

His whole schtick was basically saying we as individuals are responsible for the stress and burn out we feel on the job, the job itself is cake if we’d just have better perspective.

She met me in the waiting area lobby, kind of looked me up and down, and was like “these men are going to love you”, like what?? Wtf does that even mean. She then continued to call me a “gorgeous girl, like yourself” when referencing like how patients might react to me. \n\nThe other 2 positions I also interviewed with women, and one mentioned how she had to” start working out again because look at your body”, and she couldn’t even see my body!! Like you can tell I’m not overweight and that’s it? The other woman told me she wishes she was young so she could “pull off my look”, which isn’t that bad, but still, my look is very plain, I do little makeup, and I’m a brunette. Like wtf.\n\nAnyway, point is, has anyone dealt with similar or think this is unnecessary? I just think they are tiptoeing some kind of almost inappropriate line when they bring up appearance?\n\nThanks for any thoughts, stay safe out there guys and gals!",

    "text": "Nursing student: should I ignore it or report it? Hi all, thanks for being suppportive and helping new nurses/students...\n\nI am wondering where to strike the balance between \"not causing trouble\" and intervening when I see nursing teachers do really concerning things. Recently, one of my teachers in lab (who is a long-time nurse) kept making racist jokes (she was voice-acting as the dark-skinned mannequin, and kept putting on a \"black voice\"... saying things like \"don't touch my weave!\")...needless to say she's a white lady.\n\nShe also did a really rude impression of me in front of the whole class to demonstrate how bad I was at going through a procedure, then she kept telling me to \"watch all the other students\", but didn't really specify what I was supposed to watch for. Finally to cap it off she spent the last 20 minutes of class venting about how her patients this past week have been \"bitches\" and her new coworker is a \"new nurse bitch\"... This was all in a single class period. I mean, it seems like this lady had a rough week with patients and coworkers and is taking it out on students, and i feel pretty bad for her tbh, but also I have ADHD and I would really just love to take one class where the teacher doesn't make fun of me for it.\n\nAnyway, I've been dreading seeing this teacher again. I am wondering: should I just smile and take it, knowing that these people are the gatekeepers to clinicals and the rest of nursing? OR should i complain because this person made me want to peel my skin off with how mean and insensitive she is, and legitimately this is so concerning that someone is allowed to behave this way.... How have you guys managed?",

After graduation I turned down an internship in MICU to work in acute dialysis because I made about double what my classmates were making. \n\nFast forward 10 years and I tried to get out of dialysis and do something else, but I lack the bedside skills.  I wanted to work bedside to get some experience and move on to something else. I managed to get a bedside job but it was a disaster. My lack of skills came back to bite me.  I made lots of mistakes and couldn’t keep up. I was fired a few months after I started.  \n\nSo now I’ve been bouncing around at a few low paying jobs, barely keeping my head above water, and worried that I’m going to get fired again. After all these years as a nurse I’m making the same money I did when I started and I’m so embarrassed that I haven’t done better.  I can’t move into other areas, like case management or outpatient, because they all require a year or two of bedside experience which I don’t have.  Plus I have this black mark on my record from being fired by a major employer in my area.  \n\nOther information about me.  I have a masters degree and I’m 60 years old.  Going back to school isn’t an option. Getting more education has had zero affect on my being able to get a job.  Being 60 will make it impossible for me to get an internship anywhere. Even if I did I don’t know if I could keep up. \n\nI can’t retire. I need a job to pay bills. Is there any hope for me? What can I do to stay employed?",

    "text": "PLEASE HELP. New Grad Job Offers -- I think I'm making a mistake. Time Sensitive. Hello. This is my first reddit post, I really need some general advice from anyone willing to offer it..\n\nI am a new graduate nurse as of this month. I completed my senior practicum on an ICU unit and fell in love but have been told by instructors that new grads don't specialize and should start on a general med surg floor. I spoke with my preceptor about it and they mentioned that they started on an ICU as a new grad and encouraged me to apply to ICUs within that hospital. I applied to a generalized \"All ICU Positions\" posting as well as probably 7 other specific ICU floors at the same hospital toward the end of November.\nOf those 7, I was invited to interview for 2. 3 of them were pretty quickly updated to \"No longer under consideration\" and the last two positions I applied for were \"Under Review.\" I assumed that most of the positions just weren't interested in a new grad.\n\nThe first position I heard back from received my resume via the generalized ICU posting. The unit is a \"specialized disease\" floor but as of now it is basically a COVID unit. I interviewed and it was my first interview ever. I just wasn't well prepared for the types of questions she asked and my answers were not well thought out. Ultimately, she seemed to like me and since this floor has a sister Med/Surg floor, she offered me a Med/Surg Position instead of the ICU. I told her that I would need time to think about it because at that point I had another interview. \nMy second interview, I just completely bombed. I have anxiety and am normally pretty good about managing it but for some reason it consumed me. Hands were shaking and sweaty and the words just wouldn't leave my mouth. \n\nAnyways, I didn't get that job. \n\nSo at this point, I had one med/surg offer, one bombed ICU interview and two applications under review. I assumed the last two postings never updated the status as I hadn't heard anything for about 3 weeks. I'm a new grad so I know that I can't be picky because at the end of the day a job is a job. So I verbally accepted the only offer I had. I was disappointed it wasn't in an ICU but I decided to be more of a glass half full type of person in this situation. \n\nNow to where it becomes complicated... about 3 days after I accepted the M/S position, I get a phone call from an ICU nurse manager interested in interviewing me. I was at work at the time and listened to the voicemail the next day. The nurse manager had been out of the country and was still out of the country but their secretary had just forwarded over my resume and wanted to interview when they returned the following Tuesday (about a week later). The voicemail was a little choppy and they requested I email them because their service was in and out. So I sent an email because the dream was ICU. I think this may have been my first professional faux pas.\n\nI wanted to be as candid as possible so I let them know right off the bat that I had already accepted another offer at the hospital and had not signed the required new grad contract yet, but I still expressed interest in the interview because to be frank, I had not been successful in my previous 2 ICU interviews and wasn't confident that anything would come of it but still did not want to have any regrets or \"what ifs.\"\nSo the nurse manager asked if we could speak over the phone when they had service (in 2 days) to speed things along, and long story short, they actually ended up offering me the position. I was through the moon until reality set in. \n\nSo users of reddit, thanks for reading all of that. But now what do I do? \nDo I continue with the M/S position out of professional obligation?\nDo I accepted the ICU position because that was the ultimate goal?\nWill I be considered unprofessional by the original unit and be black listed?\nPlease help.",

    "text": "Does this describe your school? How modern segregation works in an American school... A user in the politics sub laid out in comments a very lucid account of how his seemingly integrated school is in fact very segregated and has very different outcomes for white and PoC students. I've seen aspects of this in schools I've worked in -- although not quite as stark or severe -- and I wondered how common this from the perspective of U.S. teachers here. And what can we as educators do to address this sort of structural inequality?\n\nThis sub doesn't allow x-post links, so I'm excerpting -- you can find the post on r/bestof.\n\n>At my high school the way it worked was the school itself was a very old  and historic downtown institution. Hundreds of years old.  Big beautiful  building literally on the tallest hill.  \n>  \n>Lots of famous people graduated from it in the early 20th century, and not surprisingly it was all-white for most of that time.  \n>  \n>\\[...\\] in the  2000s the freshman class was about 30% black and 20% Latino.  \n>  \n>It was a relatively good school; so it’s not a surprise that PoC students who lived in walking distance wanted to attend.  \n>  \n>And they *really* wanted to attend, because their other options were the two all-black high schools or the one Latino high school. \\[...\\]  \n>  \n>Side  note:  those two schools were literally toxic (built on a superfund  site), and literally crumbling (walls falling down). They were sh$t  holes.   The Latino high school was a little nicer, but still seriously  underfunded and >95% Spanish speaking IIRC.  \n>  \n>None of those three schools had college admission rates over 25% or graduation rates over 75%.  \n>  \n>Anyway,  the white kids however, were mostly rich kids who were 2nd, 3rd, 4th,  or even 10th generation students! \\[...\\]  \n>  \n>“4th  generation rich white kids” don’t live near downtown in the modern American Midwest city— so most of the white students were commuting up to an hour to get to class. \\[...\\]  \n>  \n>The school actually had a  very very big waitlist for these “out of district” spots, and was  operating significantly over capacity.  We even had portable “temporary”  classrooms set up on the practice football field.  \n>  \n>But the **alumni donations**  from these rich multigeneration families made up a large portion of the  operating budget of the school.  That money was the main reason the  school was so good!  \n>  \n>I know I’m getting a little off track here, but think about that dynamic.  \n>  \n>explicit segregation is illegal  \n>  \n>more rich white kids from the suburbs want to attend than you have space for  \n>  \n>parents of the rich white kids fund the school  \n>  \n>the school is way over crowded  \n>  \n>you can’t stop local black & brown kids from attending  \n>  \n>So what do you do?  \n>  \n>1️⃣ First, you segregate the students during the school days.  \n>  \n>You do this because the rich racist parents don’t want their brats going to class with undesirable black, brown, or poor people.  \n>  \n>This  is pretty easy to do, because the rich white kids are going to 1st-8th  grade at their suburban schools in a different district.  \n>  \n>Those suburbanites get funnled straight into an all-white “honors system” of classes on the first day of freshman year.  \n>  \n>The prerequisites for those “honors” classes are conveniently only offered at the suburban schools.  \n>  \n>PoC students have no way in.  \n>  \n>(I put “honors” in quotes because these kids were NOT smarter, and there were no tests they had to pass.)  \n>  \n>2️⃣  You make the school experience for the white kids as high quality as  possible while making the experience for everyone else as bad as  possible.  \n>  \n>The white kids’ have  nicer classrooms with lots of sunlight, digital white boards, and 20  students or so.  They have better teachers, and more rigorous academics  available to them.  They get guidance counseling aimed at helping them  navigate the college admissions process, etc.  \n>  \n>The  black kids are packed 33 at a time into crappy basement classrooms with  chalk boards. Their teachers are alcoholic sports coaches, and their  “counseling” is about picking a ~~menial~~ working class career  after graduation (something that doesn’t involve college, like:  mechanic, waiter, hairstylist, taxi driver, etc).  \n>  \n>3️⃣  You segregate all the extra curriculars as much as you can.  \n>  \n>The newspaper and yearbook were white.  The debate team was white.  \n>  \n>The  only integrated extracurriculars were a few of the varsity sports  (basketball, track, and football had black kids \\[...\\]  \n>  \n>Oh, and the choir and the school musical were integrated because they had open auditions.  \n>  \n>(Although  the drama department still managed to do a second big production every  year that was, you guessed it, more exclusive, bigger budget, and all  white).  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>4️⃣ you create a system to funnel the black and brown kids you don’t want there out of the school as fast as possible.  \n>  \n>This  can be done through selective enforcement of truancy rules. It can be  done with extremely harsh grading of the “bad” classes.  \n>  \n>Lots of ways to do it.  But the end result is pretty easy to describe in numbers, because my class size was nearly 1000 exactly.  \n>  \n>On the first day of high school, me and about 999 other students showed up.  \n>  \n>About 500 white freshmen (mostly from suburbs)  \n>  \n>About 300 black freshmen  \n>  \n>About 200 Latinx freshmen\n\n\\[...\\]\n\n>Of the 500 white students, about 50 would drop out or transfer before graduation.  BUT, a new 50 would transfer *into* the school.  \n>  \n>So  the graduating white class would be about 500. Over 95% of the white  graduates went on to attend a four year colllege, many of them Ivy  Leagues.  \n>  \n>Of the 500 PoC students,  about 250 would drop out, or be forced by the academic office to change  schools by Junior year.  Another 100 would drop out or transfer before  the end of senior year.  \n>  \n>About 150  total would graduate.  About half of them would go to college, and less  than half of that group would graduate college.  \n>  \n>So final score for “preparing students for life” is:  \n>  \n>500 PoC freshmen = about 150 high school diplomas and about 40 college diplomas.  \n>  \n>500 white freshmen = about 500 high school diplomas, and about 400 college diplomas.  \n>  \n>Also,  it’s hard to even know the distinction between drop out and transfer,  as the system was designed to hide the drop out rates.  My high school **officially** listed all drop outs as transfers.  \n>  \n>And the schools they “transferred” to?  They just never listed those kids as attending.  \n>  \n>The  kids functionally just disappear from the system like they have moved  out of state.   No one looks to check if that happened, because no one  wants to know.  But everyone knows.  \n>  \n>This is still happening to this day.  \n>  \n>It’s a nice neat little system beautifully encapsulating white hegemony & how *systems* can enforce white supremacy.  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]TLDR:  the system was  & still is essentially designed so that rich white kids can go to  their parent’s alma-mater downtown, but won’t have to interact with  black or brown students. The way that is achieved is by making life as  bad for PoC students as possible.",

    "text": "That does it. I'm out. I've had enough.\n\nFirst it was getting screwed out of a promotion when new management came in.  I busted my ass for this time and earned my stripes with the previous management,  for which I was offered a department lead position.  I wouldn't have cared if they said \"Look, you've only been working here for two-and-a-half years and Alice has been working here for 5.  We believe the most senior person should get promoted.\"  But they went out of their way to show that Alice (not her real name) is the new golden child (she's the only member of the old staff who got promoted - they brought their own people in for other leadership/management roles).\n\nNew admin is cliquey.  They show no sign of wanting to support the teachers who are already here, who have been building the school for the last 5 years.  They've made it clear that they have no faith in certain teachers (in particular former military and industry), since they prefer the \"traditional path\" teachers.\n\nNow this:\n\nOur school is divided between students who are above-average to pretty strong academically and students who really struggle to keep up.  30% are pretty strong academically, and 50% are just average, and 20% are lagging behind.  Recently new management has decided something has to be done about the disparity.  They claim that there is a disparity among achievement among ethnic groups.  Asian, Latino and White students tend to do better than Black students.  They want to correct this.  Most teachers agree that something should be done, but we just don't agree about HOW it has to be done.\n\nNew admin suggests what essentially amounts to cooking the books.  Since we're private, we don't have IEP's.  Kids who are struggling are placed in a special \"Learning Assistance Program\".  Students in this program cannot be given lower than a 60 on any assignment as long as that assignment is turned in.  They can't be failed for a class until we've met with the parents three times, and a reams of paperwork are signed.  Electives and sports count towards GPA, and we're to make accomodations in grading as well.  Kids in the Learning Assistance Program can't be suspended.  They get special projects that basically boost their GPA.  Teachers have to bump up grades sometimes by more than an entire letter grade at the request of admin for these projects, which for whatever reason, we're not allowed to see.  Honors classes will no longer be weighted.\n\nThe result is that even less than one month in, in the Learning Assistance Program are basically starting to game the system.  In some cases I was basically requested to dictate the correct answers to students during tests, or to upload homework answers to Moodle so that the students could \"print that out and submit it\".  Literally all they're doing is printing stuff out, putting their name on it, and I'm required to give them an A because they've answered everything correctly.\n\nNot to mention that we now have kids intentionally acting up in class (e.g. dancing in the aisles  or bouncing a basketball to get on teachers' nerves), or in some instances verbally threatening teachers.  Some students have been openly defiant and admin shrugs it off because \"different cultures have different attitudes towards authority\".  These kids are acting up are either white or black American.  The \"different culture\" kids are more or less respectful.\n\nNeedless to say, some people think it's unfair.  We have a lot of first-generation Asian and Latino immigrants who came to this country with the dream of \"making something of themselves\".  These kids are driven as heck to perform well academically.  But they are not given Learning Assistance.\n\nAdmin doesn't want to backpedal on the policy and demands that we check our privilege, ignoring that our student body and current academic team is pretty diverse already.\n\nI refuse to lie just so my admins can look good and appear as some great humanitarians when they are chasing their own ego.

    "text": "Coming Full Circle / Le Cordon Bleu & the Public School System I'm a dual certified teacher with 17 years as an elementary teacher and 14 years and counting in Culinary Arts. Despite having lived and worked in two different warzones as an expatriate teacher in the international American schools, nothing in my 31 years of experience could have prepared me for the past year. In reading the posts on this board, I have seen many complaints about lax district attendance requirements for virtual education and hybrid. I have also seen a growing number of posts about administrative pressure to inflate grades given how abysmally some students have become during the current crisis.\n\nWhile I have not had any first experience with grade inflation at my school, in an effort to \"improve\" our attendance rates, my district has unintentionally undermined our virtual instruction. Per district policy, we are required to mark students present if any one of the following conditions were met.\n\n1. The student attended your virtual class. (It doesn't matter if the student just logged in and then logged out without bothering to stay for instruction. The mere fact that he or she even bothered to log on counts towards attendance credit for that student's class.)\n2. The student didn't log into your virtual class but did log onto Canvas which is our instructional support platform where we keep all student lessons and assignments. If a student logged into Canvas on the day you had your virtual class, that student will be marked as present.\n3. If the student sends his or her teacher an email on the day you had a virtual class, that student will be marked present.\n\nThe students aren't stupid. A lot of them have milked the system and my attendance rate has dropped to the point where I only have 1-2 students out of a class of 16 who bother to attend any of my virtual classes.\n\nConcurrent with the bad attendance has been the growing failure of students to complete any of my assignments. At least 40% of my students are failing. Some haven't even logged onto Canvas in two months.\n\nI think there are a lot of parallels between what's been happening in many of our public school systems and what happened to the American division of the Le Cordon Bleu culinary schools.\n\nIn France, Le Cordon Bleu is a widely respected and venerated culinary school that was first opened in 1895. Throughout the last 126 years, a succession of great chefs have taught the next generation of culinarians whose ranks have included the likes of Julia Childs, Giada De Laurentiis, and Mario Batali\n\nIn 2000 Le Cordon Bleu entered into a partnership with Career Education Corp. (CEC), a company that bought up private vocational schools in the United States.  Instead of adopting the Le Cordon Bleu curriculum and standards, the CEC slapped the Le Cordon Bleu logo on their culinary uniforms and campus signage. When the American division first opened, these schools included the Southern California School of Culinary Arts of Pasadena, California; the Western Culinary Institute of Portland, Oregon; the International Culinary Academy of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; the Scottsdale Culinary institute of Scottsdale, Arizona; and the Midwest Culinary Academy of Mendota Heights, Minnesota. In time, the American maintained and operated 16 schools. Trading upon the Le Cordon Bleu name, at the height of their popularity these schools generated an annual net revenue of some $100 million dollars.\n\nAs a 2003 Le Cordon Bleu graduate, I had the dubious distinction of watching this school begin its slow decline almost from the moment it first opened its doors. After having burned out as an elementary teachers after 17 years in the profession, I cashed out my Texas Teacher Retirement account to pay for my tuition at the Texas Culinary Academy in Austin. I was 40 years old at the time. My father still insists that I was having a mid-life crisis.\n\nMy class had about forty students. While most of the students were recent high school graduates, our very oldest classmate was in his 50's, though a life of hard living had made him look a decade older. I was the 2nd oldest student in the class. There were also a handful of students in their 30's. The ranks of the older students included a registered nurse, a veteran who had mustered out after 20 years in the service, a pastor, a computer engineer, and a restaurant line cook.\n\nOur school uniforms consisted of white culinary jackets with the Le Cordon Bleu logo emblazoned over the left chest. We also wore herring bone black and white cook trousers, black socks, and close toed non-skid shoes, along with a white skull cap. In addition to our textbook, we were each issued a black tool kit that included a complete knife set.\n\nAlthough the CEC had published and distributed a set of student handbooks that outlined the school rules and expectations, these standards were rarely applied. In theory, students who were late to class should have been barred from attendance and made to attend a Saturday makeup session. In reality, none of the chef instructors seemed to care if students were as much as 30 minutes late.\n\nStudents were expected to come to class wearing clean uniforms. In reality, some students came to class wearing jackets that were stained with ingredients that had been used during the previous day. One student even showed up wearing sandals with black socks. The chef instructor let this student stay even though his clothing was a health code safety violation.\n\nA lot of the younger students didn't bother doing their reading assignments or their written homework. Many of these didn't even bother to take notes in class before we went to the kitchen for our hands-on production lessons.\n\nSince most culinary classes teach students in cooperative learning groups of 3-4, the older students banded together into two groups out of vested self interest. We did this because we had work ethics and standards. We read the assignments. We completed the written homework. We also took notes.\n\nDuring our lab time in the kitchen, many of the younger students would disappear for extended smoke breaks of 30 minutes or longer. They wouldn't help with production. They wouldn't help with cleaning the kitchen. Since we were working in cooperative groups, each group shared a common grade. Those of us who were responsible didn't think that these other students deserved to share our grade since they made no contributions to our group effort.\n\nAt the end of our course of study, as part of our graduation requirement we were expected to complete a three month externship under the supervision of a chef or a kitchen manager. Students who had been allowed to develop slovenly habits and to show up late for class had a rude awakening when they tried to act the same way in the commercial food service.\n\nEven though the Le Cordon Bleu schools were still relatively new, by the time I got to my externship, it was hard finding anyone who would take me. The Texas Culinary Academy had already developed a dismal reputation among most of the area restaurants. Students were late to work. Students were improperly attired. Students thought they could get away with 30 minute smoke breaks. Those students who hadn't paid attention in class and who had not assisted in the kitchen were quite out of their depth and lacked the basic skills that a culinary extern should have had.\n\nI was lucky. I eventually found a placement with a boutique hotel that had an attached French restaurant. I completed my externship without problems and graduated with honors. As with nearly anything else in life, what I got out of the program reflected what I had put into it. I went on to work in the food service for five years before returning to education as the chef instructor of a high school Culinary Arts program.\n\nI was successful. A lot of my former classmates were not. Since Le Cordon Bleu did not hold their students to high standards, their reputation suffered. In time, student externs could not find placements. Le Cordon Bleu graduates could not find jobs.  In 2015, CEC tried to sell their schools but the Le Cordon Bleu label was so badly tarnished in the United States that they wound up announcing their pending closure. No new enrollments were accepted after January of 2016. The last classes graduated in September of 2017.\n\nLe Cordon Bleu is an example of what can happen when you don't enforce high expectations regarding attendance, student participation, and grades.\n\nI started teaching in 1982 before President George Bush's No Child Left Behind Act ushered in accountability testing. For those of you who are old enough to recall what teaching was like BEFORE accountability testing you may remember that some schools and some districts had similar lax standards.\n\nBefore accountability testing, elementary students were often \"socially promoted.\" It didn't matter that these students were failing and had cruddy attendance. During my first elementary teaching job in a Title I district on the south Texas border, my principal told me that kids who were retained would suffer worse from the emotional trauma of being left behind than if they were promoted with \"a few\" academic deficiencies.\n\nAlthough I was a novice teacher at the time, I remember thinking that my 5th grade students were 2-3 grade levels deficient in both reading and math. If the principal thought that these were \"a few\" academic deficiencies, I couldn't help wondering what a glaring deficiency might have looked like.\n\nThe problem with having lax standards was that some schools were graduating students who were functional illiterates. Back in 1977, the U.S. Office of Education estimated that an estimated 23 MILLION American adults were functional illiterates who lacked the ability to read restaurant menus and train schedules.\n\nIn 1976, a student named [Peter W. sued the San Francisco Unified School District](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/217048241.pdf) because they had graduated him even though he was only on a 5th grade reading level and had failed several grades. The plaintiff alleged that in failing to properly educate him, he had been relegated to a life of manual labor since this was all that he was qualified to do. The trial court dismissed the complaint. This was subsequently upheld upon appeal because Peter W's failure of educational achievement was not accepted by the court as an \"injury: within the meaning of tort law.\n\nAnother lawsuit followed. In 1976 [Edward Donohue](https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/20/archives/a-graduate-who-says-he-cant-read-saying-he-is-functionally.html) was graduated even though he couldn't read at all. In 1977, he sued his former school for \"educational malpractice.\"\n\nHis lawsuit alleged that even though he had failed all of his classes during his junior year (except for woodshop), he was socially promoted and became a senior. He was even placed in a senior English class despite having failed English as a junior.\n\nDoes any of this sound familiar to our current education climate?\n\nThe teachers at Mr. Donohue's former high school said that there was an unofficial rule that said that they could not fail more than 15% of their students. Instead of actually educating their students, there was pressure from the building administration to graduate students as a way of getting rid of them.\n\nI  wish I could say that Edward Donohue had a fortuitous outcome to his lawsuit. I am sorry to say that he did not. In 1977 in [Donohue v Copiague Unified School District](https://www.leagle.com/decision/197948747ny2d4401440), the court found in favor of the district. The summary statement alluded to, \"the practical impossibility of proving that the alleged malpractice of the teacher proximately caused the learning deficiency of the plaintiff student. Factors such as the student's attitude, motivation, temperament, past experience and home environment may all play an essential and immeasurable role in learning. Indeed as the majority observes proximate cause might 'be difficult, if not impossible, to prove'.\"\n\nIt wasn't until 1981 ([Hoffman v. Board of Education](https://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1427&context=hlr)) that a plaintiff was (partially) successful in pursuing an educational malpractice lawsuit. Daniel Hoffman was a student in the New York City Schools. At the age of five the school district placed him in a class for the mentally retarded. He remained in this class for the next 12 years despite the fact that a school psychologist had insisted that he wasn't retarded but instead suffered from a low self image. Although the court awarded the plaintiff $500,000 in damages, this judgement was reversed upon appeal and the case was dismissed.\n\nThe reality for all of us is that this isn't 1976, 1977, or 1981. It's 2021 and the times have changed.\n\nIn 2016,  a high school graduate Jamarria Hall joined a class action lawsuit with six former students in suing the Detroit public schools because the district was graduating students who were illiterate. As a junior and later a senior Mr. Hall alleged that his English teachers taught him using 3rd and 4th grade level books.  His attorney alleged that his former school was literally falling apart and lacked certified teachers and up-to-date textbooks. It argued that conditions were so appalling that in one instance an 8th grade student took the initiative to teach math to his classmates for a month after his teacher quit and the school was unable to find a replacement.\n\nIn May of 2020, after four long years of legal battles, the Detroit Public Schools settled and agreed to pay the seven former students a total of $7 million to settle this education malpractice claim. In settling they have also created a legal precedent for future education malpractice claims.\n\nThe implications of this recent case should be clear. School districts may successfully be sued for educational malpractice. While school administrators seek short term relief by having teachers inflate grades so as to appease the school board and angry parents, if these practices were to continue, it could have serious legal implications in the years to come.\n\nNot to detract from the validity of anything that I have said, but this is also why teachers should belong to a union. Most unions offer legal representation and liability coverage as part of their benefits.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nEdited: I graduated from Le Cordon Bleu, Texas Culinary Academy in 2003, not 2001.

    "text": "The One About Air Conditioning... This was inspired by another post, and happened a few years back. Couldn't decide on the most appropriate flair.\n  \nMy building often hit 80 degrees or above from April to October. Whenever the HVAC was \"fixed,\" it would only work for a few days. You couldn't get a technician out again for a month. \n  \nIt got bad. Black mold started growing in a building that was only 10 years old at the time. The building was already over capacity, and rooms often smelled like a locker room. On top of this, our building has a modern design. Many rooms have no windows, and the majority of windows we do have will not open. I had taken photos of thermometers, and instances of black mold, and told my supervisor- several times.\n  \nThen after years of inaction, I made a DIY AC out of a styrofoam cooler, PVC pipes, and a desk fan. I would grab a bag of ice on my way into work every day. This did not solve the problem, but gave me some relief for the first half of the day. Plus- I have a few medical conditions that are compounded by heat.\n  \nIt was still enough to cause a stink in my building though... That along with the body odor of 2,000 students.\n   \nYou see- I refused to aim the fan towards the class. My money, my contraption, my comfort. Several kids complained to me that they were hot too, and I told them I know exactly how they feel- which is why I took things into my own hands. I encouraged them to be creative in how they managed their comfort while in the building, and to have their parents let admin know about their discomfort.  \n  \nNext thing you know, I'm getting called in to my admin's office, and she flat out asks \"have I been telling students to have their parents contact them?\" \n  \n\"Yes.\"  \n  \nBut seriously, lady... What did you think was going to happen. The HVAC has not worked properly in 5 years. I, along with just about every other teacher in the building, have complained throughout the course of this time, and nothing.  \n  \n\"You can't do that!\"  \n  \n\"Why?\"\n  \n\"It looks bad.\"\n  \n\"And having class in a 90 degree room, with no windows and no ventilation looks good?\"\n  \n\"Did you build a portable AC?\" \n  \n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You can't do that either!\"\n  \n\"Why?\"\n  \n\"It's not safe.\" \n  \n\"And the black mold that has been found throughout the building, likely from that lack of ventilation, is?\"\n  \n\"And you're not sharing the device with the rest of the class? Why is that?\" \n  \n\"My money, my comfort. Plus, two seconds ago it was unsafe. I wouldn't want it to harm the students.\"\n  \n\"And you told the students to get creative in how they manage their comfort? What does that mean?\" \n  \n\"I don't know- if I did that wouldn't be very creative would it?\"\n \n\"Does that mean violate the dress code?\"\n  \n\"Never said that- but these are young adults. Their body; their decisions on whether they follow arbitrary rules.\"\n  \n\"What about bringing in fans and other contraptions like you have? This would be unsafe and disruptive to the learning environment! We would have to assume liability if anything happened!\"\n  \n\"You are finally starting to get the hint! These conditions are uncomfortable, unsafe, unsanitary, and completely disruptive... Yet the school has not taken accountability, despite their liability.\" \n  \n\"You're crossing a line.\"\n   \n\"\"What rule have I broken?\" \n  \n\"I'm sure I can find one or two.\"\n \n\"I see. This is about asserting control, not about enforcing policy. Do what you have to do. But when you do, this will be escalated. I can get doctor's notes that will force your compliance with certain accommodations. I'm also sure that the local news would love to see those pictures I took and shared with you of the mold and thermometers. I'm also sure that disciplining me after bringing these items to you and other sources within the community, would constitute some sort of retaliatory violation- that HR would love to hear about. The ball's in your court. I'm just trying to get by, and not die of heat stroke in the process.\"\n  \nShe said she'd talk it over with the building Principal.  \n  \nI was completely expecting a disciplinary meeting, but the gods intervened. About a week after this happened, a few buildings in my district had their HVAC systems test positive for Legionella bacteria. Two teachers in my building had contracted Legionaires disease during that current school year, and this came to light after the HVAC story hit the news. \n  \nThis was a huge controversy in my area, and building maintenance has never been more scrutinized. That Summer, they actually fixed the HVAC units in building, and the new contractor said that proper maintenance schedules had not been performed since the units were installed.  \n  \nNever got disciplined formally, but I've definitely been on some sort of shot list since.",

Six weeks into the school year, the district decided that we didn't have enough students to justify two 4th grade teachers so I became self contained with 33 kids.

My co-teacher was moved down to 1st grade self contained with 30 students because the 1st grade teacher quit.\n\nAbout 2 months later, I am still self contained with 34 kids.

I am lucky enough to have an amazing TA assigned to my room full time, but for the last two weeks she has been called to sub in a different classroom almost every single day due to staff absences.

I switched grade levels and have a new-to-the-building colleague on my team/in my hallway who has quickly become someone I avoid and the sight of them exhausts me. They seemed nice at first, but that quickly changed. This person talks constantly about themselves to me and our other coworkers (20+ minute monologues), is nosy, name drops our superintendent (\"I know them personally, I edited their dissertation\"), spreads gossip, butts into conversations, texts outside of work hours (sending memes and videos), talks badly about their students/colleagues in front of students, and generally is an energy vampire who seems to socialize more than they actually work.\n\nEx) The other morning I got to work early and was getting myself together after a sub day - they came into my classroom to ask for stickers (!?) when I was clearly busy, and tried asking me about my weekend. I told them I was busy and to come back later, but...read the room! There's been days where they come into my room after school and will talk for 30 minutes about their family drama, living situation, person they're sleeping with, etc.\n\nI work closely with this person and their classroom is right near mine, so there's no way to completely avoid them. They've also alienated 3 other colleagues due to this variety of behavior and seemingly lacking understanding of social cues/desire to socialize instead of work. I've established certain boundaries like making sure my window is covered (They notoriously peek into rooms and then knock or barge in), stating I'm an introvert and need alone time, and creating a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign for my classroom. I keep conversations short and don't seek them out or go to their classroom. When I or my other colleagues are not available, the problematic colleague will immediately go to another teacher's classroom...not to work, but to socialize, complain and ask for help without offering any help in return.\n\nThey also seem to manufacture drama out of nothing - one day I was leaving my classroom after lunch to teach one of my classes that is in a room downstairs. I shut my classroom door and hustled since our halls are crowded and passing periods are short. The problematic coworker approached my teacher BFF and asked \"Is Ms. BlackFlowerx3 okay!? She looks so mad.\" I wasn't mad - I was trying to be on time to my class.\n\nI feel bad for this person because they clearly want to fit in at our school, but I'm trying to keep my own head above water and am at my wit's end dealing with the extreme neediness and constant \"in your face\" behavior.\n\nIt's exhausting, and I'm looking for advice on how to manage the situation. \n\nTL;DR: My coworker is exhausting and I'm annoyed and so are other coworkers, advice?",

    "text": "Transformation schools (low test scores) New teacher advice   Hi everyone! I'm entering my second year of teaching in Florida. I had a REALLY tough first year because of COVID and I was in a tough school with kids who had no respect for me or any teacher. They were all struggling with tough home situations and most of the parents were unavailable. The dicipline system was shit and the principal was a toxically masculine manipulater. Every day was hell for me and I'm still healing from the experience. \n\n  I'm trying to stay in teaching because I know it's what I want to do but I'm so scared of signing into a school that will be a repeat of the last. I've interviewed with four 5th grade positions (originally I taught middle school) and I'm excited to start elementary education (if I land a job). A lot of the schools in my area have very poor test scores. They're mostly rated 2/10 on the \"greatschools\" website. It's incredibly depressing to see the systemic racism trickling down into our school systems and it just feels like teachers are left to pick up the pieces of these broken homes catalyzed by our government. \n\n Every school with low test scores have high Hispanic/black populations. Poverty has an effect on the development of the brain (not irreversible but definitely something to be aware of). So these kids have much lower reading levels, problem solving, and higher order thinking skills. The brain is able to be molded and \"flexed\" but not to the standard florida expects of them. The schools keep pushing kids through grade levels even it they failed every class. \n\n  The kids at my last school would purposely do nothing all year and wait for credit recovery to get their passing grade. They didn't want to be taught. No matter how enriching I made the content. If I built a relationship with the student it would immediately crumble when I had to dicipline or put my attention on another student. They all CRAVED that attention and they would fight one another to receive it. Whether it was negative or positive attention. My classes had 25-31 students in a tiny room. \n\n  I was beyond stressed and depressed. I just want to teach but I don't have the skills to manage my classes yet. I know it will be better this year having learned what I did, but they overall problem is still there. The teachers at my last school were all just as stressed and disappointed in the school but they were badasses and could handle their classes without the help of admin. I'm a much softer and introverted person. I would use all the skills and techniques I learned in school which favored talking to each student when they have problems and building relationships. But EVERY student had a problem and when I would focus on one the rest of the class would get out of control. \n\n  Any advice on what I should do next? I tried setting up my own brand on outschool (online teaching) but I haven't gained enough traction to replace a full time job. I could get a part time job during the school year and keep growing my outschool brand? It would be nice to be home with my dog and disabled fiance. Honestly 9-5 jobs wear anyone down....",

I asked her to come to my office to discuss the status of certain projects. When we met I asked her how things were going with one of the accounts her response to me was \"I don't like you, I don't like your personality, and I have a problem with someone like you managing me\". I asked her what she meant by that, she stammered for a moment and said \"your age\". Then she said I should take her out to lunch to get her to know me better because she thinks I act like I'm better than her, and that I talk down to her. I responded that I'm not going to do that but my door is always open if she wants to talk. At that point she stormed out out of my office and went to our most Senior manager to complain about me. She said I was rude to her. My Senior manager reprimanded me and said I need to be kind to our employees because they are complaining about you. I told her what transpired in my office prior to that employee going to her. I also asked her to please provide and example of when I've said or done something rude or disrespectful to any employee. She could not name a single instance. I also asked her who other than that single employee has complained about me. She couldn't name any other person. I feel unsupported my the Senior manager. I'm not the type of person to pull out the race card but I think this employee is racist and doesn't like the idea of a black person managing her. She said her issue was my age, regardless which it is she is still prejudice. Why is it my job to make this employee like me in order for her to do the job she was hired to do? I don't understand why my boss can't just support me and let the employee know that she needs to provide the information I need in order to insure the clients are being taken care of. This  employee has created issues for me on several different occasions. Bad mouthing me to other managers and other employees. Other than this one employee everything else is great. Ive already gotten a raise that i didn't ask for and the owner even said he see a VP position in my future. What should I do about the situation with this individual employee?",

    "text": "I haven't done any real work in nearly four months, is it time for me to start looking for a new job? Hello reddit,\n\nI am a new graduate working an entry level tech consulting job that I started in August. On paper my job appears great, with good benefits, great starting salary, and in a field with excellent upward mobility (data science or engineering), however the experience on the ground has not exactly measured up to my expectations and I'm not exactly sure what to do about it. \n\nI started this position back in august of 2020, and went through a training program which basically consisted of zoom lectures run by a few senior associates struggling to answer the questions of hundreds of trainees, monotone lectures conducted by HR, generic training videos centering around basic company policies, or LinkedIn learning courses covering the various technologies we could expect to encounter when we were assigned to a client. Supervision and individual attention was minimal, and the managers responsible for running the trainings seemed stressed and overwhelmed by the sheer number of trainees they were responsible for.\n\nAt first this didn't bother me, as I knew these trainings were typically held in person with a greater number of tutors and staff, and expected that most of what I would need to know would be taught to me on the job once I was placed with a client, however after these trainings were concluded, a client never materialized. \n\nThis brings me to my current predicament, I completed my training in mid October and was told to be patient a wait to be contacted by accounts looking to take on new team members. I have since gone through multiple round of interviews with several different accounts, most either looking for skills outside my area of technical knowledge or for more experience than I currently possess. I have been assigned to a client by the company timesheet, only to hear nothing from that account for weeks, only to be told by them after reaching out myself that they have no Idea who I am. I have also had a client verbally commit to bringing me on board for a position that would require me to move several states from my current location, then promptly dropped of the face of the earth.\n\nI have no direct supervisor, and most emails I send out seem to go into a black hole. This leaves me spending most my time trying to make up work for myself (mostly trying to learn SQL), checking my email a couple times a day, filling out my timesheet, sending one or two emails out a week that usually aren't responded to, and fielding calls from prospective client accounts a few times a day that don't go anywhere. \n\nMost days it feels like I could do whatever I wanted (or nothing at all) and nobody would care, which honestly makes me feel like a leech and worry for my job. The lack of a definite position within the company is also forcing me to continue to live at home, as I cannot sign a lease when I may be assigned to a client in another state at a moment's notice. \n\nThis is my first real job, and I am insecure about my ability to find another one given the current job market, so I ask you reddit, at what point should I seriously start thinking about bailing, and what would you do were you in my shoes?",

So I recently applied to a new job and they proposed a salary at about 10% more than my current salary. I verbally accepted this new job because I was looking to get new experience however I would be expected to work longer hours for this job (consulting). Now the day I received the paperwork to sign I'm notified at my current job that there will be a global salary increase to some key employees based on multiple factors and I'm one of them (I did not threat my manager to leave or anything). I dont know yet how much is going to be the increase but it got me thinking of what I should do next ...\n\nA) Sign with the new job anyway and maybe change for the same salary\n\nB) Try to negotiate the new job and tell them that I now think that my proposed salary is below my real market value\n\nC) Back off of the new job and be possibly black listed from them. I work in a relative niche market, the number of potential employers is limited\n\nWhat would you do?\n\nThanks!!",

    "text": "Help! How do I navigate the fact I'm applying for a new job, while my current job is actively making big plans around me moving into a new role? I work for a mid size company (30-60 people) that is like a close knit family. The companies pay is below average in a lot of roles, but mine is especially bad for what I do. The company has had some cash flow issues so there has been an across the board pay freeze for a while. For the past few years I have persisted because I've been given opportunities to get experience and do stuff I never would have the chance to do at any other company. My personal drive has led to me being involved in some higher level decision making processes and project managing. Essentially I've been fine with the lower pay because I could survive, was getting great experience, and if cash flow went black I'd get myself a raise.\n\nSo four things happened that have really complicated my situation. They are as follows\n\n* Five months ago I was asked if I would move into a new role. I was willing to take on this new role so I agreed under the caveat that I get a raise. This term was accepted as the company seems to have some available cash for stuff like this and I was told I'd get the raise once the transition happened. The number I was given was still very low for what I currently do, never mind what I will start doing.\n* My wife got pregnant\n\nNow for the kicker. Two events happened on the same day\n\n* My wife got put off work on sick leave. She has HG, which is essentially severe morning sickness. It's so bad she is often bed ridden. Unlike normal morning sickness HGoften lasts the whole pregnancy and It is unlikely she will be working again until she has the baby, and after that she will be taking maternity leave. (important note: we live in Canada, so parental leave is pretty long, and also health coverage from work is not a concern for me). I was hoping to save up money to help us through the maternity leave, and with her getting her pay we were hopefully juuuust going to make it. That just went out the door big time.\n* The company announced a massive and complex initiative  for which my new role will be integral. This was announced abruptly, and sis mission critical to the business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow to tie it all up with a bow. I'm badly in need of cash and a very high paying job for my exact current role and exact expertise opened up with another company, I'm currently in the process of applying and think I may get an offer. NOW as we all now, that does not mean I will get an offer! So lets consider my chance 50/50. Here's where everything gets so muddled in my brain. I absolutely do not want to cause issues at the company I'm working at, and if I need to continue here I will be more then happy. If I have to stay I will need the new role and the pay raise. But I feel that if I get an offer from the other company I cannot in good conscience - knowing I am going to need that money for my wife and kid - turn it down. If that happens this whole endeavor to move me into a new role will have been for nothing.\n\nI feel like a complete jackass for even considering it and am plagued with guilt during meetings where we are discussing plans, but on the flip side I do not want to show my hand, be considered a flight risk, and then be in a worse spot. To top this all off I have some pretty big concerns with the fact of whether or not I will be able to do this new job. If my life was exactly the same as it had been 5 months ago, hell ya! New project: bring it on. Late nights and coffee, I can do it. But my current focus will absolutely be my wife. I am at a total loss for how to navigate this. Do I be honest, sit down with the people above me , let them know about my situation? (I have not yet told anyone my wife is pregnant because it's been a complicated pregnancy.) do I handle this like any other job hunt and simply wait til the offer and proceed with life as normal until then? Do I try and just leverage a bigger raise now?\n\nTo be honest I am usually quite good with stuff like this and I'm often the person friends turn to to navigate, but for some reason all the pieces of this puzzle will not fit together in my head, and I want some impartial third party advice.\n\nTL;DR\n\nMy current job made plans 5 months ago for me to start a new role and get a pay raise (my pay is currently much lower then it should be.) The plan just started to move ahead, but during the long process my financial situation drastically changed for the worse - the raise won't cut it, and based off the companies financials I don't think they can hit offer enough to get me where I need to be. I've applied for a high paying job I think I'll get, but have no offer yet. How do I navigate the active planning around me being in a new role at work to keep the door open, but not totally damage the company if I have to leave?",

    "text": "Life circumnstances affected my early career and life - how do I get back on track? Hi Everyone,\n\nI'd really appreciate your advice on how to get my life back on track after a bumpy few years. Sorry in advance for the long post and vent - I wrote on this subreddit before but I really feel like a big failure, both personally and professionally.\n\nMy situation is the following: I am a 31 years old EU citizen living in the UK, I have a BSc and MSc in Managerial Engineering (a sort of mix of basic Engineering and Economics) from Italy and a MRes in Machine Learning from the UK, all 3 degrees obtained with highest honours and Dean's List. I co-authored 8 papers on ML algorithms (h-index 5).\n\nFor 6 years I have worked in London in the Tech industry as a Data Scientist / Business Analyst, and I detested it. In London, 99% of jobs in Data are about Social Media, Marketing, Product Analytics and Financial Services, problems I don't really care about. The culture of the companies in Tech is very oppressive and in general I hate the social climbing culture of the city. I had very bad luck with housing and flatmates and ended up having to move house (mostly against my will) 11 times in 6 years. I felt unsettled, unbelonging, unable to find a hobby or a friend or an escape from work, I have lived with mental fog unable to understand why my life was so miserable. I burned out several times and changed 7 jobs in the same time span (working mostly in \"cool\" companies but never feeling motivated). I got so depressed that in June my fiancee of 4 years left me, because she coudn't handle me anymore.\n\nFor long time I was scared to take a hiatus and rethink my life but because of Brexit, because staying in the UK without a salary and a safety net is not really an option and because my fiancee was British and I wanted to stay with her I continued on autopilot, ignoring all the red flags I encountered everyday. Now I live alone in a flat that is too expensive for me, without furnitures because my ex took them all, working from home in a small town outside of London without a single friend - I was diagnosed with mood disorder and I barely manage to get up and work everyday. I want to go back home to stay with my family for some time, but I don't even have a room or a bed to stay in either of my parents' flats.\n\nNow I feel really down but I want to capitalise on my experience and use what I've learned in order to have a better life. I know the following:\n\n* I am motivated by challenging technical problems that require concentration, continuous learning,  structured thinking and hard work, but I'm not much career driven in the classical sense.\n* Being an Engineer, I miss working on something \"tangible\" or that pertains to physical systems, like industrial processes, IoT, sensors, renewable energy, agritech, etc... Working in Digital, convincing customers to buy more stuff, or working on abstract business problems don't really work for me.\n* I am fluent in Python and SQL, and a tiny bit in Matlab, Java and R, but don't know other programming languages or technologies.\n* I am not suited for large cities. Both London and my hometown (millions of people) are too big for me. I love being close to the countryside and live a less stressful life with more approachable and genuine people. Country of living is not a big deal, as long as it's in Europe.\n* My current company (Fintech in London) would not help me to make any progress in that sense.\n* I am open to start again from the bottom of the ladder.\n\nI essentially feel that my career should be in Electronic / Automation / Software Engineering or Robotics but I completely lack almost any technical skill in that sense. My supposedly good academic background seems useless to get an Internship or a Junior role in the field, useless even to grant me admission to a third Masters in the field.\n\nI am well aware that I'm a job hopper and that my profile as it is is completely unattractive to any employer. What can I do to fix this and explain my situation to them? I have thought about two options:\n\n* Take time off, go back home, sleep in a sofa bed and learn everything technical I can (e.g. C++, IoT, some concepts of Electronics and Robotics). I will be jobless but at least I can dedicate 100% of my time to this change and to recover from my depression. If within a year I have found nothing I will try go back to uni to study Electronic / Automation Engineering. This is choice I am leaning towards.\n* Stay in my company and in the UK, and try to make the change from here. I will have more financial independence, but I could dedicate maybe less than 10% of my time to this change, because of my work and life commitments and my depression.\n\nI know that there's no black or white answer, but what kind of advice can you give me (apart from seeing a mental health therapist) on what should I do to fix my situation and on how I can convey the above in a job application / cover letter? I'd be so sad if all my efforts and good academic results are wasted because of these unfortunate circumnstances.\n\nThanks in advance, and sorry for the long and boring post 😅",

    "text": "Habits that helped me get my next job as a software engineer  Yesterday I accepted an offer to be a software engineer at Netflix. Rather than write up a story of my whole “incredible journey”, I’d like to share a few habits that I think helped me. This is written for my future self more than anyone else. For context, I had decided to go back to being a software engineer after failing at founding a startup. I was unemployed while preparing. My completion rate of these habits was 10-80% (yes, a huge range).\n\n### Go for a short walk very first thing in the morning\n\nI read some hacker news comment (that I haven’t been able to find) about someone else who would go for a short walk first thing in the morning. They didn’t want the first thing they did to be sitting and the first thing they looked at to be a screen. For some reason, I tried it and I found it to be a great way to start the day. Use the bathroom, throw on yesterdays clothes, walk out the door. I’d say some important things out loud (more on that later) then walk and think, then maybe listen to a Ram Das lecture. Walks ranged from 2 minutes to 40 minutes.\n\nI found this habit a really low effort way to make the start of my day better. Mostly it’s nice to get anything in before getting sucked into a computer. I was in Mexico and weather was almost never an issue.\n\n### Say important things out loud each morning\n\nMost days (I’m bad at being perfect) I’d say how I intended to meet the day, my goal, three things I was grateful for, and how I want to be with my partner. Only the gratitude list changed, everything else is constant. I think mantras like these are more powerful when you live them instead of share them, so I won’t go into details except on the goal. I’d say “My goal is to get a job as a software engineer making $250k by June 30th.” I had the last interview on June 30th and got the offer on July 8th. I exceeded the salary goal. Wouldn’t be software engineering if I didn’t miss the delivery date!\n\n### Do 2 hours of core work after the walk\n\nIf there’s any habit I want to be sure to keep, it’s this one. My idea of “core work” is the most basic, distinguishing function of your job. It’s also important that it’s creating instead of consuming. I’m a software engineer, so that’s writing code. From about 7am to 9am I’d write code. It’s really nice to start the day with a few hours of the real thing before a bunch of bullshit creeps in. It’s amazing how much nonwork creeps into working life even when you’re unemployed. If you’re wondering what your core work is, there’s a good chance it’s some form of writing.\n\n### Use more single-purpose electronics to reduce phone usage\n\nSpecifically, I made better use of my Apple Watch (audiobooks in the morning) and Kindle (reading at night). Computers and phones are attention sucking black holes. Maybe more neutrally, they’re incredibly powerful machines. It is not a good thing to have a box of endless novelty in my hands when trying to read a book.\n\n### Read important things many times\n\nI think I have above-average reading comprehension. I scored very well as a kid on standardized tests and it hasn’t gotten any worse. I’m not trying to brag, just make it clear I’m not trying to make up for a reading deficiency. I’ve started reading import things many times. I read it a few times immediately, then revisit it again over time. It is amazing the new things I find in things I’ve already read. A coding problem description I might read 2-4 times. The ad for the job I ended up getting I read around 10 times. The five point summary of the Netflix culture deck I read at least 50 times.\n\n### Think of how you’ll win, think of how you’ll not lose\n\nMy two step strategy for passing the interview: 1. Win. 2. Don’t lose. It’s sounds obvious, but the split was very helpful. I’d imagine “Where can I blow them away? Where can I really win?” For me, that was coding in Python. So I wanted to make sure to create and exploit situations to show that off. I wanted them to have some really positive things to say in the debrief. Then the other side was “How would I blow it?” There are some mistakes that can really outweigh the positives and sink you. I knew for Netflix that was not knowing the culture. Some others for me were sucking at SQL and not having good answers for some work history questions. So, I strengthened in these areas and didn’t lose. These things aren’t going to be yours, but just some examples to find your own.\n\n### Rehearse\n\nLet’s say that you get a description of your interview schedule. One of the interview topics is “how you handle interpersonal conflict”. You could just read that and go “uh-huh” but another move is to like actually prepare. How about answering the question out loud “How do you handle interpersonal conflict?” then answer it again a different way. Then again the same way. Then think of more questions. “What’s a time you handled interpersonal conflict and it went well? And it didn’t go well?” There are really only so many questions about interpersonal conflict that an interviewer is going to ask you. Maybe like 8. And if you’ve practiced 8 and they ask you a 9th, you’ll probably be fine. I did this for a few dozen topics. It’s a lot of work, but I found it to be easy work. Another version (related to not-losing) is to think of all the questions I’d feel dumb not knowing the answer to, and then get an answer ready.\n\nI also practiced out loud with my girlfriend and using [interview.io](http://interview.io/). I think many people believe that you need to interview with a few companies to get warmed up before going for the companies you really want. Maybe if you’re a new grad and you really don’t know what’s going on. Otherwise, that is a very inefficient way to rehearse.\n\n### Meet with a project manager weekly\n\nLife coaches are expensive and creep me out. I found meeting with a project manager to talk about all the ongoing to projects in my life for just 30 minutes is extremely helpful. I found someone on Upwork who lives in Colombia, speaks perfect English and is very affordable.\n\n### Spend 30 minutes each day doing my oldest tasks\n\nI use Todoist, and wrote a script that grabs my oldest tasks one a time. At the same time each day, I’d spend 30 minutes just taking the tasks in order of oldest first. If I couldn’t do it in that moment (maybe it’s taking something somewhere) I’d try to move it forward somehow (put the object near the door). The oldest task isn’t usually the most important. But by the time a task is the oldest, it means I’m avoiding it.\n\n### Focus\n\nMy job application funnel was one cold email, one interview loop, one offer. I’d rather come in first place for one job than second place for a hundred. I couldn’t have done the prep I did for Netflix for even five companies at the same time. Some companies lowball and you need competing offers.\n\n### Do a shutdown ritual\n\nLook at all the tasks I completed today. Look at all open tasks. Look at my schedule for the next two weeks. Say “that’s enough for today” out loud. Then do something besides work or study the rest of the day.\n\n### Put my phone and laptop away\n\nEach day (ok probably like half or less) I’d have a notification go off to put my phone and laptop away. I left them charging in a closet. It made getting them out in the morning more purposeful, too. I still had my kindle for books.\n\n### Actually try some of the things I read about\n\nSort of a meta comment, but it’s so easy to just consume productivity porn. There’s a bunch of things on this list and they’re pretty different from each other. The odds that none of them would be helpful to you seem pretty low. So maybe read it again (ha!) and see if there’s anything you should try for a bit.",

    "text": "No Internship New Grad to 100k Offer - Tips for Applying New Grads! Public uni graduate, no previous work experience/internships, only \\~50LC completed, \\~200+ applications submitted over the course of 6 months, 15 interviews for many rejections and 2 offers.\n\nI was one of the unfortunate graduates during the 2020 pandemic and had a helluva time finding work in this economy. It's that time of year where many new grads enter the job market and I'm hoping this post finds these new grads or entry-level applicants so they can learn from my mistakes and know that you don't need to be a coding prodigy to land a good position!\n\nIn no particular order, here are some of the biggest learning experiences I took away over my 6-month journey to landing an offer at my company citing some of my own interview experiences.\n\n* **Don't sweat LeetCode too much:** I see a lot of emphasis on this sub over LC completion but IME, it has very diminishing returns.\n   * If you are absolutely determined to get into FAANG out of school then by all means go crazy but no company outside a Facebook interview ever asked me a LC Hard and the large majority of technical questions are LC Easy with some Mediums. Sharpening your DS&A skills is never a bad idea but your time *might* be better spent sending out applications than grinding problems you are unlikely to see.\n   * Stick to the \"Common Interview Questions\" section when you do LC, then branch out from there. IME array and string manipulation are the most common interview questions.\n   * Stick to one language for interview practice questions. If an interviewer requires you to work in a language you are unfamiliar with, use pseudo-code and explain your logic. I passed one round of my technical using solely pseudo-code and the engineers enjoyed my approach to the problem.\n* **Tips for improving callback ratio:** yes, it's normal to go stretches of time without callbacks. Sometimes you just get unlucky. But there are things you can do to improve it.\n   * Diversify your application platform: I got a ton of activity from Handshake and Indeed, LinkedIn feels a lot like RNG on whether you will get seen or not. Handshake is an excellent platform for new grads, I've scored callbacks just from companies seeing my transcripts.\n   * Network with recruiters. I got the interview for my current position by reaching out to a technical recruiter for the company on LinkedIn. This single decision helped me leap past the \\~400 applicants that applied for the job!\n   * Always work on your resume. At the end of the day resumes are a *living* document, always improving. There is already a lot of resume-writing resources on this sub so be sure to check those out if you suspect your resume isn't making it to a pair of human eyes.\n* **Yes, cover letters are required:** making a decent CL is part of sending in a good application. No, you don't need to spend 15 minutes handcrafting a custom cover letter for every application.\n   * Have a specialized cover letter that applies to each type of position you apply for. If you are spending more than a few minutes tweaking a cover for a position, then you need to save it for reuse when you apply to a future similar position.\n   * EX: I had a data science cover letter that talked about my Python libraries/projects used, a Java developer cover, a full-stack developer cover involving PHP, etc.\n   * If you are really going for quality over quantity, you can adopt this strategy with your resume as well. I however stuck to 1 default resume I spent a lot of time curating and it seemed to do well.\n* **Be careful what you put on your resume:** one of my biggest mistakes early on was packing a dense resume full of a bunch of languages and technologies I had seen but didn't fully understand. This worked against me in the Facebook interview where the interviewer became doubtful of my true abilities as a new grad.\n   * Stick to listing the technologies you really know. I listed SQL on my resume but had a very embarrassing interview where I spent 5 minutes brain farting on a very simple query because I hadn't reviewed aggregation in a while!\n   * Stick to your guns but nobody ever got anywhere in business without really selling themselves! If you are confident you could easily learn a technology then go ahead and list it. Just be prepared to have a good pitch for yourself if your interviewer asks your experience.\n   * Limit your listed projects to only sizeable/significant assignments, preferably made in a team. A console BlackJack or Poker game is going to be an uphill battle to sell relevant experience to a professional. With that being said...\n* **Don't undersell personal or school projects:** I see a lot of professionals on this sub completely discount many student projects as non-relevant experience. As a new grad, these are some of your most valuable talking points and having this mindset is self-sabotage.\n   * EX: My senior project saw me developing an API for a full-stack web app with a team of 5 students. We worked in an agile environment with scrum methodologies and weekly sprints, documented user stories, features, technical requirements. Worked alongside a blackbox testing team (aka another team of students that tested our code and gave feedback). Our product manager was our professor in this case, who proposed what features they would like to see.\n   * Things like this are all relevant to the SDLC in my workplace and if you can demonstrate you have gained experience with these in prior projects, you have a huge head start above other junior applicants!\n* **Interview Preparation:** this is the homework that should be done prior to any introductory interview with a company.\n   * Spend time preparing a doc of all the relevant skills you have towards that position. Write down any questions you have about the company. Write down a script of why your projects demonstrate some of those skills. Come up with a reason why you are applying to this company (other than the pay!).\n   * One big advantage of interviewing virtually is you can have a set of notes to guide your responses and the interviewer is none the wiser! I would avoid actually reading scripts during interviews because it's very obvious to people when you are reading something instead of actually speaking.\n* **Tips for nailing the interview:** time is almost always the limiting factor of an interview. You have a limited amount of time to convince this person that you are fit for the job, this means you need to cut down on any rambling and focus on only what sells you as an applicant.\n   * If you don't already, you should have a 60-second elevator pitch ready to sell yourself to an interviewer. There are lots of guides about this online on how to craft an effective one. This is your response to the \"Tell me about yourself...\" question.\n   * You should similarly have a \\~2 min pitch for every project you have on your resume. Follow the [STAR method](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method) for explaining these in an efficient manner. Be ready to expand on anything your interviewer asks. More on that...\n* **Know your projects end-to-end:** you should be prepared to answer most if not all questions of your role in a project or job. This is often what separates good and bad candidates.\n   * If you aren't deeply familiar with every project on your resume then you either need to go back and take notes on them or consider removing them. One senior engineer grilled me on the API I developed (how is it exposed to the client? etc.) and I struggled to find a response. I went into all future interviews prepared to answer that question from then on.\n   * You should be able to answer why (why this tech stack over another?), how (what tools you used), when (timeframe for development), etc. With this topic in mind...\n* **It's okay to say \"I don't know\":** you should know how to say \"I don't know\" gracefully.\n   * One of my biggest mistakes early on is trying to present myself as a master of everything. It leads to huge interview anxiety because I felt like I needed to prepare for every single question like an expert. The reality is, it's okay to not know! No developer at my company is an expert in everything, that's why we work in teams!\n   * The best answer you can give to this is along the lines of \"I don't know X, this is the type of problem I would refer to Y or Z to solve\". During an interview I couldn't recall the exact syntax for a regex problem, I ended up passing this interview anyways because I explained how I would find it.\n* **Stay motivated and know your worth:** don't fall for desperation! Wait for the offer that is right for you (if you have the luxury of time). \n   * My first offer was from a lesser-known bodyshop with low pay and if I would've accepted it, I would've missed out on an amazing opportunity with the team I currently have.\n   * Always remember that you are #1 and don't ever feel bad negotiating or sticking up for yourself. I received a 48 hour exploding offer from the previously mentioned bodyshop and I insisted if we couldn't come to an agreement on an extension to sign, that I would walk. They quickly conceded and I ended up rejecting their offer, in part due to how poorly they treated me as an applicant.\n\nThere's more but I think this covers all of the biggest advice I would give to my past self preparing for interviews. Best of luck to all those chasing their dream and know that you can make it happen!",

    "text": "The Ultimate Guide to Third-Party Recruiters ## Introduction\n\nThird-party recruiters can have a critical impact on your ability to secure a CS job. They can be the difference between your application disappearing into the black hole politely known as \"the application stack\", and getting directly into an advanced stage of a recruiting process, with better reputation and odds than most candidates.\n\nChoose the wrong one, however, and you may be rejected with prejudice.\n\nThis guide will help you identify the right third-party recruiters to help you get that dream job, and screen out those who will not help or actually hurt your chances.\n\n## What Makes a Great Third-Party Recruiter\n\nGreat Third-Party Recruiters are defined by 3 qualities:\n\n1. Reputation for promoting only high-quality candidates.\n2. Positive, close relationship with key people involved in the hiring process and decision, in particular the Hiring Manager.\n3. Track-record of placing people in positions that are similar to the target position. The more similar - the better. Best of all if it's the same position within the same company, org, and team.\n\nThese 3 qualities tend to be highly correlated. Recruiters with a strong reputation for their high-quality candidates will be sought out by Hiring Managers and Internal Sourcers / Recruiters. Both parties will seek to build a mutually-beneficial relationship, that will naturally lead to the Recruiter placing candidates at the company. That will obviously strengthen the relationship, sometimes to the point that the Third Party Recruiter becomes a part of the decision process, and Hiring Managers will prefer their candidates.\n\n## Average Third-Party Recruiter\n\nWe just described a template of a Great Third-Party Recruiter. Let's discuss the average one. The average Third-Party Recruiter has no reputation for promoting only high-quality candidates, because typically that's not what they do. Third-Party Recruiters get paid very large sums of money for placing a candidate, but no immediate penalty for pushing a candidate who fails to place. As a result, on a shallow level, they are strongly incentivized to throw as many candidates at each position, and hope one sticks.\n\nThe industry is full of these average Third-Party Recruiters, there are literally thousands of them. If you're an average Recruiter, your work is high risk, high stress, and very labor-intensive. As a result, many Recruiters are literally kids straight out of college. Some aren't even US-based: there's a whole subset of the Third Party Recruiting industry which operates from foreign countries to keep costs low, for example from the UK. UK Third-Party Recruiters in particular will often try to pretend to be domestic, since they typically don't have strong relationships to the companies they try to target in the US - the US market being by far the most lucrative for such recruiters.\n\n## Lies Third-Party Recruiters Tell\n\nWhich brings us to the following point: Third-Party Recruiters are scum. Even Great ones will occasionally take some liberties with the truth. Average ones will regularly lie to your face.\n\nThe biggest and most important lie Average Recruiters will tell you is that they are Great Recruiters. Here's an example Cold Call from an Average Recruiter:\n\n> Hi there, CompSki!  You were personally and highly recommended to me by several of your past colleagues, who vouched for your skills and hoped I can help you in any active or passive job search you may have going on. My close friend X, whom I placed at Extremely Prestigious Inc 10 years ago, is now the hiring manager for a very selective team, and we thought you'd make a great candidate!  I already placed 5 people there over the past 6 years, and I want you to be number 6!  Why don't you send over your updated resume?\n\nThis is a real cold-call I received from a Recruiter on LinkedIn. Notice how it hits all the boxes of the Great Recruiter:\n\n1. He pretends to be familiar with my past colleagues. They \"recommended\" me to him, but more importantly: recommended him to me!  Clearly this is a Great recruiter with rock-solid reputation in the industry, that not just one but _several_ of my past colleagues had recommended.\n2. He pretends to have extremely close relationship with key decision-makers in the hiring process, specifically the Hiring Manager.\n3. He has placed multiple candidates in the team being targeted over the past several years.\n\nIn addition to all this great stuff that clearly indicates he is a Great Recruiter, the Cold Call also pitches Extremely Prestigious Inc, which is known to be incredibly desirable and selective in the industry. What's not to like?\n\nWell, turned out, everything, because it was all a lie.\n\nThis Recruiter didn't know a single person at Extremely Prestigious Inc. He couldn't even get me a first interview there. He never placed a single candidate there. He had no reputation in the industry, and nobody I ever worked with ever talked to him: he literally just found me on LinkedIn.\n\nHis plan was to lure me in with with the promise of placing me at Extremely Prestigious Inc. Once I bit, he said that process will take a long time, so in the meantime he should submit my candidacy to a large number of other companies. I was experienced enough to become suspicious, politely declined, and told him to call me when his Hiring Manager soulmate from Extremely Prestigious Inc finally gets around to talking to me. That was the last I ever heard from him.\n\n## How to Screen Third-Party Recruiters\n\nAverage Third-Party Recruiters will waste your time. Bad Recruiters, who have a name in the industry for incessantly pushing bad candidates, can even hurt your chances of ever getting an interview for positions you allow them to target for you.\n\nClearly it's important to screen and only work with Great Third-Party Recruiters, but how?\n\nThe simple answer: **don't trust and verify**.\n\nFirst off, some newbie Recruiters don't even have enough experience to misrepresent themselves as Great. These should be easy to screen out, as most of them are barely out of college and their LinkedIn profile pic looks to be the same as the one they use on Tinder.\n\nHowever, most seasoned Recruiters, especially those hunting for more senior talent, know to present themselves as Great. Now we need to sift those who actually are Great, from those who merely misrepresent themselves as such.\n\nThe way we do it is we **verify all their key claims**.\n\nRecruiter claims to be recommended by your \"past colleagues\"?  Great!  Which ones, exactly?\n\nWatch for **vague**, **evasive** responses:\n\n\"I can't tell you, unfortunately.\"\n\n\"It was Person OnMyTeam, but we haven't actually spoken to them directly...\" (they just saw on LinkedIn that he was on my team.)\n\nAll of this is typical of Average Recruiters. Great Recruiters will do the opposite: they'll readily provide you with specific details you can verify, such as names of colleagues that recommended you, and/or they placed.\n\nThis goes for all the relevant details:\n\n\"You are lifelong buddies with the Hiring Manager, and both think I'm a great candidate?  Great!  Please set up a phone call with them ASAP.\"\n\n\"You placed 5 candidates there over the past two years?  Amazing!  Surely one of them will be glad to connect on LinkedIn and take a call from me.\"\n\nThe above shows how you can use LinkedIn and your own common sense to verify crucial claims.\n\nIdeally, you should only work with Great Recruiters that you verified as such. Failing that, work with the best you have: an Average Recruiter who may not check all the Great boxes, but does check a few of them and at least doesn't egregiously lie about multiple issues of substance.\n\nDon't ever let a Bad Recruiter represent you, as they will hurt your chances and cause various issue. For example, I had some Bad Recruiters harass, threaten, and try to bully me into accepting an offer I got through them early in my career (\"if you reject an offer after they flew you in and hosted you for several days, you'll never work in the industry again!\"). Even a junior engineer typically represents tens of thousands of dollars in revenue for these recruiters, and it's best to stay away from the worst ones who will stop at almost nothing to get that cash.\n\n## How to Find a Great Third-Party Recruiter\n\nThis is admittedly the weakest part of the guide. I am, unfortunately, quite familiar with Bad and Average Recruiters, but only worked with a handful of Great ones through my entire career. I won't pretend to be an expert in finding them.\n\nThe only way I can recommend is **use your network**. Try to connect with senior engineers in great positions, and find out how they got recruited into those positions. If it was a Third Party Recruiter, get an honest assessment of their skills from your contact - thanks to this guide, you already know what to look for. Try to cross-validate: once you identify a Great recruiter operating within your network, they will typically have a track record with multiple strong candidates in your network. Talk to these contacts as well, and assess whether that recruiter is, in fact, a Great one.\n\nThat's all I have to suggest. I'd love to read your feedback, especially about any way you know of finding these rare and valuable Great Recruiters.",

    "text": "Is Dynamics CRM/Power Platform stunting my technical growth? Lately I've been seriously doubting my current career path and feel like I'm currently at an important crossroads. This has been grinding in my head for the last few weeks and I would really appreciate some constructive insights and 2nd opinions. Now, before explaining my current situation I'd like to address that I'm currently working in Belgium. Not that this has a big impact on anything technical related, but I feel like this might be an important remark regarding advice about the job market.\n\n**Starting as a Junior .NET Developer**\n\nIn november 2020 I got the opportunity to start at a big firm as a Junior .NET Developer within a team that focused on implementing, extending and customizing MS Dynamics Connected Engagement applications (Sales, Marketing, Customer Service, Project Operations...). Not exactly knowing what I was really jumping into I can definitely say the first +-6 months were an insane rollercoaster where I had to absorb an insane amount of information (eg. getting to know inhouse backend and frontend frameworks, D365 CE in's en out's, Power Platform, Azure services, DevOps...). During those first few months I mainly gained experience during the onboarding process (internal and external training), acquiring PL-100 and PL-400 certificates, performing technical work related to D365 projects in final build or existing support mode etc.\n\nIn May 2021 it got more exciting as I got the opportunity to work on an entirely new and big project where the technical lead and myself were the only ones being assigned to perform the technical implementation/customization from scratch. Although having to set up everything from scratch was very exciting as I had only worked on existing projects until now, unfortunately this project never really got up to speed. Decisions on our client's side took ages and even though there should've been enough technical work for 3-3.5 days/week, I barely managed to fill 2 days/week for this particular project. To fill up the week I again had to rely on performing support or optimalisations for already existing projects, with some research every now and then. In September 2021 an internal audit at our client even resulted in the project being put on hold for an undetermined amount of time. This obviously resulted in my agenda being filled up entirely with external and internal support projects and optimalisations, until now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My current situation**\n\nIf I tell you that I'm in my 20's, very ambitious and (sometimes too) skeptical about everything I spend my time on, you probably start thinking the story above is not ideal to give me enough fulfilment. Although my job title officially states 'Software Engineer', I really don't feel like I've been 'engineering' a lot of advanced software at all during the last 6 months even though I've gotten a lot more responsibilities. Obviously this has to do with gaining more experience and everyday tasks becoming part of your comfort zone. During this 1st year I've written hundreds of plug-ins, custom Actions, custom API's, extended/optimized our frontend Javascript framework, worked with Power Platform and solutions ALM, Azure Webjobs, Service Busses etc. But as the weeks progress I'm feeling more and more like a configurator than an actual developer/engineer...\n\nThe problem right now is that I'm trying to identify what's causing this lack of fulfilment and what my next step should be. As fortune telling from a glass sphere is still pretty unreliant today I'd like to reach out to you guys who might've been in the same situation or have (brutally honest) opinions ;)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My concerns**\n\n* I'm aware working as an employee at my current company results in my team and I having to rely on clients with a support contract or acquiring new clients/projects to be able to perform actual technical work. However, looking at my current weekly agenda and the current state of the sales pipeline, this doesn't bode very well for a future change of the situation. A logical move would be to look for another company within the same role, but that brings me to my next concern.\n* Everybody knows 99% of the time during an application process people of HR and Business will try to sugarcoat whatever you're looking for in a company. I've been in some non-binding conversations with other companies and obviously they all have \"big and very exciting projects\". Assuming this might be true, this sparkles the following thought: will another technical D365 CE software engineering job be sufficient to support my technical growth?\n* Although I'm sufficiently self-aware to realize I still have a lot to learn regarding Power Platform / D365 Development, it feels like all the \"hard work\" is already done for you and you're somewhat trapped in the D365 \"cage\". A big part of the job consists of getting to know all the in's & out's, quirks, out-of-the (sometimes black) box processes MS provides and finding a way to deal with them. This particular feeling might be caused by the lack of projects or how solutions are designed and build at my current company, but I'm also thinking about potentially leaving this \"cage\" and start looking for more general software engineering jobs to get more experience with .NET Development, frontend JS frameworks, databases, design patterns...\n\nIn the end, this post quickly grew out of the proportions I initially had in mind. But I feel like the entire scope is required to fully understand my current situation. I'm really looking forward to some of your feedback and at the same time hope to maybe inspire other fellow juniors! :)",

    "text": "How do I address miscommunication in my team as an entry software engineer? I was hired at my current company last year, as an entry-leveled software engineer. I work in a small-sized team, with no senior lead, so the requirements come from product owners with no technical background at all. The issue becomes more apparent when they request me to integrate entire systems that they don’t have a full  technical understanding of in order to meet business requirements that I don’t have an understanding of. There have been many instances where they initially ask me to implement solution x, when they actually should be requesting for solution y. I tend to work with data that are coming from entirely different applications, so I feel like I’m constantly developing in a black box that I have no control over. The product owner does work with a slightly more “senior” engineer with a couple of years of experience in the field, however the engineer fails to communicate the objective of those solutions with the rest of the team (or feels like the rest of the team shouldn’t need to know the information to complete the task as he previously said). I’ve requested to be more involved with some of those discussions, but have been given vague responses. I brought up the lack of clarity and accuracy with those tickets to the other software engineer, however he brushed them off as either a fault from his end that he won’t address, or miscommunication from both sides. In the end I feel like I need to do a more thorough job of asking the intended goal of these tasks, but I just don’t know how. What questions or process can I go through in order to better determine the actual intent that my team members are trying to solve? How do I address technical inaccuracies in some of these tickets when the people who are supposed to do them aren’t doing a thorough job? It feels like I always need to communicate defensively in order to better manage risks that are beyond my control.",

If you are applying, what is your anecdotal best day(s) of the week for applying and getting responses? \n\nWhat is your worst day(s)? \n\nIf you are a hiring manager or HR, what are your anecdotal “best” days for receiving resumes/applications? \n\nWhat are your worst?\n\n\n\nBasically, people run on schedules, even if they are informal. Hypothetically coming in from the weekend to a stack of resumes may average worse for applicants, or maybe better. Maybe Friday afternoons are worse because they get buried under weekend applicants. Maybe, Wednesday sucks because Wednesday sucks. Maybe the energy is there on a Tuesday, but there is still a backlog from the weekend.\n\nJust wondering as I try to stay consistent with applying. I aim for 1 per day, but sometimes I have to wait until the weekend and do 7 or more in one batch. Batching gets hard because companies are now pulling listings and reposting to restart the clock for some reason. It’s easier to track daily because each application is a little more thought out, compared to batching which I’m just spamming. \n\nDon’t tell me leetcode, I’m not even getting OAs and counting my response rate by rejection emails since that’s all I get. But at least if I can increase rejection email response, I at least know my application was processed to some extent consistently and that the contents were insufficient for the next step. Ghosted at the resume submission doesn’t benefit me at all, I don’t know if I’m so bad they didn’t even want to spend the $0.0000000000000001 sending me an email about it, or if they’re just dragging their feet and slowly processing resumes, who knows? \n\nLearning the rules of a black box that provides a random rejection or no output is insanely difficult.

    "text": "Figuring out a career in tech Hello this is my first time posting here So here goes I’m 27 years old and just received my Bachelors degree in health science but two years ago I have slowly come to the realization that I do not want to pursue a career in health care. One day my Mom asked me what I wanted to do with my life and when I said I didn’t know she and my father got very angry, I got very depressed after that until one day a friend recommended tech and when I tried free code camp while I was still in school I got hooked!  I figured out that I generally like solving interesting problems, the only issue is that it’s been a year since I started getting into tech and I truly do not know where to go from here my dad suggested getting a masters, but I’m not sure about that I’ve also heard of boot camps for coding but that is a little pricey and I’m not 100 percent sure coding is for me just yet I’ve also heard of other tech positions like cyber security, business analyst which sounds very interesting to me,  and Product/Project Manager lm also concerned of racism/hiring  in tech since I am a black male.  Some things to know about me I’m not a very talkative person and prefer my privacy, but  I can work with people no problem, Any advice would be very helpful thank you.",

    "text": "[Rant - Bad words used] Are new hires/interns supposed to be this stupid? Initiating Rant in 3...2...1...\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHoly fucking shit, last senior left alive at the firm and in charge of making sure all these new hires/interns know what the fuck they are doing while reviewing some their work. I handle the majority of their questions while the manager reviews the reconciliations and financial statements. I am always available whenever they have questions and try to help them as best as I can. I usually spend about half of my day instructing them and reviewing their work while providing constructive feedback on any issues. I have never yelled or cussed in front of them since I feel as though that's a dumb fucking way to teach someone (had a manager who would constantly yell at me for dumb shit and I always though he was the stupid fucking prick to ever have existed).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI have been training the majority of these fuckwads since September and they are still making the same mistakes they made during their first week here and I'm not talking about newbie mistakes. I literally just had one who apparently has accounting experience call me and ask how do they reconcile an account they were supposed to be reconciling since October (manager waited until today to review this account). When I asked them to provide me their notes they have been taking since October they sent me over 50 pages of chicken shit that's barley legible. The sad part is this isn't even the worst of the worst, see below for more issues. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#1. It took me 3 months to get the concept of a debit and credit to the mentioned employee above and they still ask me to verify if they are \"debiting\" the right accounts from time to time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#2. A different new hire called me on my personal phone at 2 in the morning to discuss a hypothetical situation they had and wanted to get my input as to whether or not their line of reasoning on resolving it was correct. After listening to them explain it for about 20 minutes I turned off my phone and went back to bed. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#3. New hire picked up the phone for one of our major clients (that only I handle) and started telling them that they are going to be the new point of contact since they were going to handle all of the work for them. I only asked them to enter in some checks... It took me 30 minutes to calm the client down and to take away the new hire's phone.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#4. An intern was supposed to organize receipts for items purchased with cash via an excel spreadsheet and for some reason they duplicated a lot of the receipts. Instead of totaling around $1.5k the end result was $4k. After going over the issue with them and making sure they understood the process (enter one in, verify the number, put to the side, enter new one in, verify the number, put to the side, do this until the pile is gone) they still managed to mess it up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#5. While I was in a meeting with some of the partners and my manager to discuss bullshit budgeting shit an intern walked in to tell me their computer was broken and wasn't turning on and that they were going to need a new one and that they had already spent around 30 minutes looking on their phone for a better one and that this one they found was perfect and for the cost it was a total steal and that and that and that and thoagofhgaokojafdshojadfohkjadofhjao. After going to their desk and spending about 15 seconds looking at their shit it turns out they accidentally kicked the power cord and it detached from the back of the desktop.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#6. New hire needed to print something out and didn't know their computer was connected to the \"community printer\" (backup printer we have in case our personal printer is down). Proceeded to print out around 200+ pages of bullshit to test and see why it wasn't printing from his work station. One of the partners was the one to discover this and ended up throwing a fit because all of the wasted paper and ink.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#7. An older client brought us some paper documents we needed to scan into our database and for some unknown fucking reason when my manager asked an intern to scan and bring it back so the client can keep the originals the intern scanned it, placed it in the wrong online folder, and then shredded the documents. I still cringe about how my manager had to have the client wait while he located the documents, then came back to the client with black and white photocopies of the documents they just fucking gave us and having to explain what happened.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI loathe to think of how badly this fucking busy season is going to be. The only thing keeping me sane is the fact that whether or not they extend the tax deadline past April I will be quitting regardless.",

    "text": "An Accountant's Guide to Karaoke You're at your firm's happy hour and it's getting late. The partner is settling the tab, and a lot of the managers have already gone home to their families. But for you and your new staff friends, as well as some energetic seniors, the night is just beginning. While discussing which venue to venture to next, someone mentions there's karaoke at a bar nearby. This proves to be a popular idea, and, displaying varying degrees of inebriation, the crew heads for the karaoke place. Nervous, you go along, having never done karaoke. You don't think of yourself as a fantastic singer, and a twinge of apprehension makes it through your cloak of alcohol-fueled confidence. What if everyone else pressures you into singing something? What if you get up there and absolutely suck? You're an accountant, not a pop star. What's going to happen?\n\nHello denizens of r/Accounting, I am u/BeerSlayer69, and while I have left the arena of public accounting for the greener pastures of industry, I feel compelled to impart some wisdom I have gained on the subject of after-work events karaoke. I have no idea if karaoke is a popular activity for accountants in general, but it was certainly a common occurrence for my firm in the pre-COVID era. The previous paragraph describes many nights I experienced during my Big 4 tenure - for those out of the know, the \"Big 4\" are a group of professional services firms that hire many people right out of college, and trick them into working insane hours by bribing them with copious amounts of alcohol. As such, the social scene involves many young adults, already with livers of steel developed in college, continuing to drink at an alarming rate. While many people choose not to participate, I can safely say that being known as someone who can party with the best of them helped my career, both interpersonally and professionally. Therefore, I intend this guide to not solely be about being a good singer - rather, it's a guide to help you give your best showing if you end up under the spotlight at karaoke. Additionally, while I am writing this from an accountant's perspective, it can be applied to anyone who finds themselves performing karaoke in front of coworkers. So, without further ado, let's get into it!\n\nThere are three main angles you can take when singing karaoke, depending on your vocal talents, personality, and goals for your performance. I will address each in turn, and provide tips for each.\n\n**#1 The Good Singing Angle**\n\nThis is the most straightforward of the three angles. If you can sing in tune, and know a few songs particularly well, just go out there and be a star. People will love it. Personally, I was blessed with a decent ear and grew up playing instruments, so singing karaoke relatively in tune isn't an issue for me. I am by no means an incredible singer, but the bar is quite low when it comes to karaoke. If you know your song well, you will shine. Some do's and don'ts:\n\nDO: Practice your songs in the car, all the way through. Singing along to the song by yourself, with the vocal track, is an entirely different experience than being in front of a crowd, singing to the instrumental version. Make a repertoire of a few songs you know REALLY well, and then you won't even have to think much when you're performing. This is key, because it lets you just let go and enjoy yourself without having to focus on getting the words and timing right. Also make sure you know the WHOLE song and not just the first verse and chorus, as losing your place halfway through can quickly become a trainwreck.\n\nDO: Emphasize timing above all, even at the expense of pitch. This may seem counter-intuitive, but trust me, the cringeworthiest karaoke disasters are from people being completely off the beat of the song. Even if you're out of tune, being able to keep up with the song will result in a far better performance, and remember, it's just karaoke, so no one expects perfect pitch.\n\nDON'T: Sing an insanely difficult, esoteric song. This is for you very talented singers - no one cares if you can absolutely belt a Broadway number, opera, or a 50s jazz standard. Pick something upbeat that people know. But read the room - you can certainly get away with a nice ballad or slower song if the venue is more low-key. I once witnessed a grown adult man sing \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" by Olivia Newton John and absolutely bring the house down with his insanely good voice.\n\nDON'T: Try to sing anything too technically difficult. You will likely be kind of drunk when you perform, and it will be harder to hit the right notes.\n\nSong suggestions: I have no specific suggestions because this angle is so broad, but in general stick to rock, pop, and country. Just come to karaoke knowing a song that you can sing all the way through, and one which will not strain your vocal range, since  alcohol will limit your vocal flexibility.\n\n**#2 The Hype Angle**\n\nThis is for you party animals that aren't particularly good singers, but want to bring the energy and get the crowd hyped up. For what you lack in musical talent, you  make up for in showmanship and bravado. Songs in this category are defined by their thumping beats, bangin' choruses, and sing-along value. Extroverts and confident introverts, this category is for you. Some do's and don'ts:\n\nDO: Pick a popular song everyone knows. People love to sing along at karaoke, and will definitely do so if you pick the right song. This has the added benefit of masking your own voice, which is perfect for those who know that they are not great singers.\n\nDO: Make sure the song has a great chorus. This is the bread and butter of the song, and will be the part people are most likely to sing along to.\n\nDON'T: Go crazy. Remember, these are your coworkers, so don't do something insane like take your shirt off or attempt a stage dive. Being high energy with class is the goal here.\n\nSong suggestions: Not to beat a dead horse, but the chorus is everything for this angle. I particularly like \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\" by Def Leppard when I'm not feeling like stretching my vocal chords too much. Think songs like \"Call Me Maybe\" or \"California Girls\" - upbeat, good choruses, and pretty much everyone knows these songs and will like them.\n\n**#3 The Funny Angle**\n\nThis category is for you funny guys and gals. Karaoke can be hilarious if done right, and everyone likes some comic relief. However, exercise some caution. As everyone knows, comedy is a very subtle art, and can be very cringeworthy when it swings and misses. But, if you're known as the \"class clown\" by your associates, and your vocal talents preclude you from category #1, this is the angle for you. Some do's and don'ts:\n\nDO: Be confident. Confidence is everything when you're trying to get a laugh, and the second you start showing cracks of insecurity or unsureness, you will quickly lose the room.\n\nDO: If you can, do a rap song. The juxtaposition of a buttoned down professional spitting absolute fire is a sure way to get some laughs. The more \"gangsta\", the better. Also, if you're really confident and not too drunk, something super fast and difficult is always appreciated. Just remember in rap, timing is absolutely everything, and the words will come too fast on the karaoke screen to keep up, so know the song by heart beforehand.\n\nDON'T: Get too explicit/inappropriate. Remember, you're still with your coworkers, and need to maintain some professional decorum, so maybe avoid songs with intensely violent/sexual lyrics. However, read the room - the later in the night it is, the less senior your coworkers will be, and you can get away with riskier songs. Also, as far as rap goes, DO NOT SAY THE N-WORD IF YOU ARE NOT BLACK. I don't care if it's part of the song, just don't do it. Ever. I usually just don't say it, or replace it with \"brotha\".\n\nSong Suggestions: Rap and meme songs are your go-tos here. I once witnessed a Big 4 manager responsible for one of our firm's biggest audit clients sing \"Because I Got High\" by Afroman and it was hilarious. \"All-Star\" by Smash Mouth is a good example of a funny meme song. My favorite to perform personally is \"Hypnotize\" by Notorious B.I.G., as it is lyrically complex and has a great beat and chorus.\n\nThese three angles are the general three archetypes of successful karaoke performances I have had the pleasure of experiencing in my many nights at karaoke bars. They are by no means discrete - you can be hype and a good singer and funny all in one performance. But, I see them as the three main strategies one should consider when approaching karaoke. I was once the nervous karaoke newbie, shoved into the spotlight and frozen like a deer in headlights. I hope this guide may prepare you for any surprise karaoke nights that may occur, and ensure you put your best foot forward. At the end of the day, no one really cares how good you are at karaoke. If you put in a mediocre performance, no one's going to hold it against you, or likely even remember. But if you want to really shine and increase your popularity with your coworkers, putting on an amazing karaoke performance is just another feather in your cap. Thank you for reading this, and good luck!\n\nPS: Working from home is the perfect time to practice your karaoke! Once the pandemic is over, and people's thirst for social experiences is at an all-time high, the odds you end up at a karaoke place could be pretty high. So while the timing may seem off for me to post this guide,  I actually think it's good info to have now so you can be prepared, since you never know when karaoke can strike.",

    "text": "Received an offer for a manager position. Please help me decide what to do. I posted to r/Accounting a couple weeks ago asking for career advice. You guys convinced me to go apply for Big 4 tax manager positions. Well I just received an offer letter. Thanks very much for the advice. \n\nMy problem is now that this shit is actually happening and I need to sign the offer I can’t decide if I actually want this job.\n\nTo recap, I left Big 4 tax as a senior and I’ve been working at my current industry tax job for 3 years. My current job is a nightmare. More hours and stress than I ever experienced in public accounting. Plus no raises or promotions.\n\nSo this new offer would give me a 33% pay increase plus 15K bonus. I would also need to move to a new city (which I requested). Thought it would keep things interesting.\n\nI’m mostly hesitant to accept the offer because I’m really having a hard time picturing myself talking to clients, answering staff/senior questions, not having someone to check my work, and being responsible for my engagements. Basically I just don’t want to end up looking foolish.\n\nPlease convince me to accept this great offer.\n\nUPDATE: Offer accepted. Thank you all very much for the support. I would probably be dead in a ditch or strung out on black tar heroin without this subreddit.",

    "text": "9 months in - Big 4 reflection and thoughts / a story of inspiration After receiving my promotion from New Associate to Experienced Associate effective July 1, I figured I would write a post. The purpose of this post is to give an overview of what my experience has been like thus far, and share what I have learned, what I would do different, and what I would do the same. Aside from that, to just maybe give some inspiration to other people struggling out there. Lots of people have told me I have a hard time getting to the point and this is true. Oversharing is symptomatic of one of the ways in which autism manifests. With that said, if this can provide some inspiration to some, then so be it. If you want to skip over it and read about the experience itself, the numbered list is at the bottom.\n\nFor some background, I started at big 4 last year at the age of 25 and live alone. I went to school for 6 years, which included a whole year after first year of university of just staying in my room and sleeping 18 hours a day in an effort to just pass the time and applying to get an \"N/A\" for all the courses I took in that year. My father's parents were shot to death when he was 7 years old in a time and place without orphanages - he grew up alone. He was very physically and verbally abusive to me and my older brother. We came to Canada from Pakistan when I was 2.5 years old. I first tried to take my own life at the end of grade 4. We were visiting Pakistan for a whole year and I did grade 4 over there while my father stayed behind for work. As nurture hadn't fully taken over, I had many many many friends in Toronto who were and are dear to my heart and always will be. I did not know we would never go back to Toronto at the time so I never collected their contact info. When my father visited at the end of our trip he beat me and my older brother so senselessly within minutes of meeting us in front of our extended family sitting around us that I went to the bathroom and tried to end my life. When we moved back to Canada a week after all that we moved to a different city. I felt like I left a piece of my soul in the bathroom that day in Pakistan. Due to the move to a new city, I lost all my childhood friends and had no way in which to contact them as I knew none of their last names and the memories of their names are hazy. During the rest of elementary in a new city I largely sat alone during recess and balled out as the effects of childhood trauma and abuse were strong as I lacked the necessary social skills. Years of physical abuse dims your personality and makes you way too submissive in social situations to be able to form bonds and be fun to be around. Girls would come up to me and ask me if I was okay and I'd just look at them with sad eyes. I am also autistic. One thing I have learned with mental illness is that it's often only acceptable when you're a child. When you're an adult it becomes \"creepy\" and a display of \"bad vibes\" especially depending on the nature of the new symptoms that you may develop. During high school I had a group of people I ate lunch with but wouldn't call them my friends as they never invited me to any \"socials\" and would plan to sneak out without me if they ever went outside for lunch. I was awkward, timid, and shy but I would just largely mind my own. It wasn't their fault and more so a reflection of my personality due to the abuse at the time. I did have a few people I was close with who genuinely talked to me which I appreciated and returned the courtesy. When I graduated high school I ofc wanted to get the heck out of home and didn't even apply to the university in the same city. During first year I had a good time living in residence with people my age, lots of memories drinking 4 days a week and going to calculus hungover on Fridays with students stumbling all over each and cramped into the 11:30am class sitting all over the carpet and the steps because no one wanted to go to the 10am one with it being the only class of the day. I also experienced a lot of bullying on the floor eventually though and by the end of the year I avoided the whole floor. A girl on the floor with more social power than me had feelings for me when she became single and I would not return her advances and she just laid a fury of an attack against me attacking each and every little thing about me and my character any opportunity she got which just piled on with the rest of the floor going along with it as they would side with the person with more social influence.\n\nI retook several classes in the summer of first year because I wanted to boost my grades and I did worse/got the same grades. I was hoping to transfer into BBA from Econ. Then second year happened and I just stayed in my room the whole year (non-residence). By the end of 2nd year my roommate who suspected something was going on offered me psychedelics and that along with my summer internship started a slow turn towards improvement in my life where I started exercising consistently and over time improved my grades and personality. In the summer of 2nd year I went to the East Coast of Canada for an internship and met my first girlfriend who was a very hot tall blonde girl and that also helped motivate me to work towards improving my life and turning things around. I wanted to create more memories like that as we couldn't continue our relationship after I moved back largely because she was 4 years older than me creating a maturity gap and because of the distance. I eventually improved my grades more and more, from C's and D's in elementary, to 70s in grade 12, to 50s/60s in university, to eventually taking 3 courses a semester, then 4, then a full 5, to a 79.4 average in my final year of university including the 3rd semester graduate diploma. The next 3 years at university were amazing, aside from one year where I had crazy landlords who agreed to include an estimate for utilities in the monthly bill and then turned off the HVAC at the end of winter for 1-2 months because they were petty. I would warm up in university, quickly walk home and fall asleep with my jacket and gloves on as soon as I got home so I could fall asleep before feeling cold. Showers were next to impossible with 0 heating and I would feel my entire brain throb just trying to wash my hair. During my time at university, one thing that I had to deal with on the daily and could not share because no one would take me seriously was sexual harassment. Everywhere I would go, usually to study, women would take pictures of me without my prior consent. This bothered and angered the heck out of me and yet I couldn't do anything about it. Various times I confronted them and would just get a blank sorry or told they didn't realize it was such a big deal yet obviously it would be to them. They would do it very blatantly and without any shame as if I am not allowed to feel any anger or feel upset from creepy behaviour. Confronting people was very exhausting for me and it wouldn't result in much aside from a blank sorry. The worst would be when my friends would tell me I appeared in this random person's snapchat saying I'm cute or whatever. Anyway consequential to this persistent behaviour I developed a new symptom of autism that I had no idea even existed and it made it extremely difficult for me to as much as leave the house or be around another human being. I had hypersensitive/active vision and if someone was around me I would feel without any control I would accidentally stare at them out of my peripheral vision without any way to stop it. I couldn't do anything about it, people would get very uncomfortable with me. I later realized visual defensiveness/sensory overload/visual information processing/co-ordination of central/peripheral vision is a symptom of autism. Even something as simple as sitting in class was nearly impossible. Even watching the instructor write something on the board my mind would be like \"okay do I look directly at the chalk, at the back of his head, at his hand, when do I stop looking etc\" and people would be visibly uncomfortable which would make me upset with myself and hold me back in my ability to pursue/enjoy life. I guess a short example would be that even being in a restaurant and looking up to see the menu behind the workers was insanely difficult so I avoided that too and would go to places that had online menus so I could determine what to order before hand. I never had any such problems before but my brain went totally haywire and social interaction became next to impossible including being able to make eye contact without staring during my last year of university. It's like I just forgot everything about it. People ruined my life just for a few seconds of vanity but alas I'm sure they didn't realize this would happen.\n\nDuring my last year of university I took every supplement in the book it felt like to try to improve my condition and make my ability to attend class a little easier. I would attend class, just try to write down everything I could, and then go home and try to reteach myself/learn from a few supportive friends because the visual sensory overload was way too much while sitting in class.\n\nAfter graduating school I went back home sadly since I did not have any money. A month later I got a job at a big 4 accounting firm but the start date was a whole year later. I did everything I could to make sure to keep my social flaws at bay for the interview. Supplementing sauerkraut, black seed oil, ashwagandha, practicing pranayama breathing, etc etc. The woman who interviewed me I believe felt appreciative of the strides I had taken through my grades, from first year onwards and how they consistently improved. I also spoke very fluently and looked like a total babe which I'm sure also helped. I realized I really needed to get the hell out of \"home\" but I needed the money to do so. I stayed home for 9 months and then moved out during May 2020 4.5 months before my start date. I saved up the money to move out by finding a factory job in January 2020, and then a hardware store job in March 2020. I would wake up at 4:30, work from 6-2am, work 3-10:30pm, and sleep from 12-4:30 am for 5 days a week for 2 months. My coworkers at the factory were getting concerned because I would set an alarm and fall to a complete deep sleep in my 15-30 minute breaks every day. I did this to save up to buy a car and get the hell out. My dad of course said to not buy a used old car because I was \"too incompetent and incapable of being able to find a working car\" so naturally that's what I did.\n\nWhen I moved out in May I realized I was starting to suffer from a crazy magnitude of ptsd. My parents didn't appreciate that I was autistic and always discriminated against me and mocked me a lot. The parental discrimination hurt a lot more than the physical/other forms of emotional abuse did and it wasn't even close. I was always told how stupid I am, how incapable I am to graduate high school, how if I work extremely hard I might be able to succeed in the trades but no guarantees, how smart my brothers are in contrast to me and how they run laps around me, etc. It was as if in their eyes my only job was to facilitate them like I was a family slave and that was the only level of consideration they had towards me, that's how they always acted anyway. I was the only one who ever did anything for my brothers yet I was constantly labelled as selfish and if I didn't want to do something I would be called inconsiderate. When I moved back home, witnessing this for a whole year and feeling like a foreigner in my own \"home\" really ate me up inside in a way I cannot describe. The pain was unbearable and goes beyond reasonable explanation. It's not like it stopped when I moved back home, it just continued. My brother totalled the family car and paid a few thousand to help buy a new one (1/6th of the cost) and my parents told me I shouldn't even drive it because \"You should feel shame! It is not yours! Your brother has a RIGHT to that car! He bought it!\" and would guilt me if I came home from work even a few minutes late and a few times texted me really hateful stuff at times yet would never stand up for me but were always ready to hurt me and discriminate against me to facilitate the unreasonable demands of my siblings. If I steal someone's stuff and then help them buy a replacement does that mean I have ownership of that now? This is just one very tiny example of the type of stuff that happened my whole life because I don't want to go into it more. You can read more about that [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hoarding/comments/kz3zem/my_family_never_respected_my_property_as_a_child/)\n\nThen after having moved out in May, at the end of July I was illegally evicted because my landlord wanted to do renovations. My landlord presumably had a few friends as officers who refused to give badge numbers and evicted all of us without an order from the governing board. I spoke with many officers and they were astonished and said that they wouldn't personally do that and it isn't legal but that they can't do anything in this instance to help out. I plan to take it in court and get my $50g for an illegal eviction as per Ontario legislation. I feel upset at them for what they did. I even messaged the head of the police department on twitter asking him to stop it and he just gave a vague reply. I was homeless for two weeks and contemplated suicide when at night I would stand inside my Uhaul containing my stuff incurring daily charges to get a few pieces of clothes/a brush and toothpaste. I slept in my car usually and a few days in hotels because I couldn't afford a hotel everyday. For those 2 weeks I did not feel any of the effects of PTSD because of the Maslow Hierarchy of Needs as I just wanted a place to sleep and live.\n\nI started virtually at PwC 1.5 months later. Here are my takeaways:\n\n**1) Most people seem to come from decent families and are the smart kids in school. They are also generally kind people; however, the pressure can push people to act in ways they would not otherwise.**\n\nI have noticed this across several engagements. Most people below partner also seem to live at home if they are single. During my 2nd engagement I felt really sick and my team took over 3-4 of my tasks despite me telling them it's fine. Salute and hats off to them; I hope I can pay it forward. Most people have been very nice and very helpful and I would say I have had a good experience so far. During my last engagement I got news of the murder of the kindest man we had ever met and grew up with, just outside our own \"safe\" neighborhood. Not everyone cares about the ramblings of an autistic weirdo and bothers genuinely asking people how they are doing. He did and he cared. I cannot even fathom being 10% of that man but I viewed him like a father and grew up playing cricket with him, and he listened to me back in the day like I was his own son or his best friend, with complete empathy and with 0 judgement. Being able to speak to him for even 15 minutes was more effective than years of therapy. He gave me and everyone he spoke to so much faith in humanity. And yet because of bigotry and the vastly incorrect assumptions that the person who did this act must have had about them, they are no longer with us. This goes to show that bigotry and hate gets us nowhere and I want people to realize that and learn from that. Muslim and non-Muslim people alike had nothing but glowing things to say about them. If there isn't something to take away from that then your hearts are plugged and I can't help. Anyway, the way my manager [acted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/o2te8r/pwc_lacks_empathy_venting_here_so_i_can_get/) throughout this process I did not really appreciate. I don't hold it against him and my point is merely that the pressure of the work can push people in ways they would not have imagined before starting. And that speaks more about the nature of the environment than it does about them. I think that's a positive take on some of the ways in which management/leadership can act but I appreciate how people might not have the most positive outlook on management/leadership.\n\n**2) Hiring more people will not change the workplace culture.**\n\nThe culture is designed on overworking people to maximize margins. If there are 100 engagements, a fair allocation is 5 people per engagement, and the firm has 400 people meaning 4 people per engagement, hiring 100 more net people will not fix the problem as the firm will just take on 25 more engagements (125\\*4 = 500). This is an oversimplification but the model is not designed on people working and being paid for every hour they work.\n\n**3) There is no such thing as a sick day.**\n\nWe get 10 sick days per year but there are practically no real sick days in the middle of an engagement. No matter what happens you will always have to finish the tasks assigned to you by the end of the audit. Even if that means working on weekends. This isn't like a classical job like say working in sales or at a factory where if you take a sick day you skip the day without any other impact. Obviously this is largely dependent on your team. My second engagement I had a very considerate team and I'll always respect them for it. The only way you get time off is if you get an entire engagement off such as if you're on vacation/sick leave. With that in mind, this model can both be used for your advantage/disadvantage depending on if you need more/less time than the time allotted to complete all your tasks for the audit.\n\n**5) Use your benefits.**\n\nYou get lots of benefits. Make sure to use them in good faith. For us some include: cell phone, discounts, $2500 mental health coverage per year, $500 wellness benefit, paid sick leave etc. I got treatment for PTSD eventually after busy season near the end of April in Chicago which involved 4 injections to my neck known as Stellate Ganglion Blocks (SGB's) and 7 ketamine infusions; I took 2 weeks of sick leave while being fully paid for it. Sure I'm still broke for now but I would not even be able to manage this in many other workplaces.\n\n**6) Don't plan to work 10 hours a day.**\n\nDuring busy season we are booked for 50 hours a week. However, I noticed a few months ago that when I started the day with the intent to work 10 hours a day, I usually worked 10 or more hours, without being as productive as I could have been. When I intended to work only 7 or 8 hours a day I was much more productive in those 7 hours.\n\n**7) Learn how expectations work and act accordingly. Trust the process**\n\nIf you have a suggestion, you might be better off not saying it. Trust me, don't be that one kid who has to sound like a genius during week 1. All this will do is inflate the hell out of your expectations and any amount you fall short of that will reflect negatively on you. However, if your expectations are in line with other new associates, you will have a better time and any amount you go above that will be seriously appreciated. If you want to sound smart, try to save it for the last week of the audit to show that you have grown and progressed over the course of the past few weeks (or however long the engagement is; normally for me it has been 3 weeks and 6 weeks for my largest one). So long as you are in line with other people in your cohort it should work out in the end. Similarly, don't press prepare on too many tasks once completed in week 1. This will make it look like you are very quick/good at your job and will get you more work and raise expectations. Complete the work but pace yourself when it comes to what you mark as prepared/finished. Track your work and progress independently.\n\n**8) Don't obsess over ratings.**\n\nSimilar to point 7, trust the process. It's okay to strive for higher ratings but if you don't get it, realize that it's not just about how hard you work but how hard/smart you are perceived to work (see expectations theory above) - I am not saying hard work/competence is not a factor - aside from that realize that the difference in pay is not that big. I got a 3 and I think the people who got 1s got an extra $1k in compensation pre-tax. Apply the marginal tax rate at the income, and you're left with $700. Then account for the fact that a level 1 will work more hours/get tougher engagements and you're not necessarily worse off. I don't mean to chastise level 1s/2s or people who get those ratings. Fair play and there's definitely some benefits; I'm just sharing some perspective.\n\n**9a) Organizational tips/approach to an audit**\n\nDay 1 is the most important part of an audit imo if you want reasonable WLB. here are my personal tips:\n\n\\- On day 1, focus on organization. Organize your file folder with all the different divisions of the company and FSLIs. Design your own template that works for you. Copy all the tasks that are assigned to you and update your template.\n\n\\- Make sure to do your best to send out ALL the client documentation request on day 1 and document it as you do in your template.\n\n\\- Go through every one of your tasks and document your plan/approach for each task in your template.\n\n**9b) Always document your list of questions in a separate document.**\n\nThis one is so important I added it as a separate point. The way to document is as follows: Link to task, screenshot if applicable of area of difficulty, and a description of your questions for the task. This might not seem very important as you start off on a team in busy season with lots of continuity with seniors who can help you out. However, during non-busy season you might get put on random small audits that were pushed aside during busy season where ZERO associates have continuity. As a new associate this really sucks when all of a sudden no one but maybe (a huge maybe) the manager/partner can answer your questions who there might be a stigma against messaging if you're below senior (depends on firm size I imagine). It can be overwhelming to be new and have no one who can answer your questions nor understand what was done last year. Especially if it's a weird industry like NPO's that have different accounting principles applicable to them.\n\nWhat this approach does, is it will not only CYA, it will also prevent you from feeling overwhelmed thinking I understand none of this. It will track where exactly your queries lie. You should then send this list to your senior and if he/she can't answer your questions, message the manager/partner and be like look I tried, I have questions and I'm not sure where else to go. If your manager doesn't reply and you aren't done the work then at least you have your bases covered. If they bring on someone else to finish up the work, they can at least know what exactly you have o/s and your inquiries.\n\n**10) Take what you hear on this sub including this post with a grain of salt.**\n\nEveryone will have their own biases/personal agendas they might project onto you unknowingly. If you chose this path you did so for a reason and no one can really know what's best for you without having an hour long conversation with you about your goals/where you are in life and knowing all the details. Primarily, I don't think it's reasonable to tell people to definitively quit without knowing more about them/their firm/life. Not saying that this subreddit isn't helpful but that's just something I would keep in the back of your head prior to making any decision.\n\nOverall, I am really grateful for this job and have felt proud of how far I have come in life even if I still have many areas to work on. The experience has been positive, and the people have been genuinely nice people. Work allowed me to distract myself from my problems and eventually allowed me to get help, after which point I felt a lot of relief and was genuinely working towards happiness. Obviously what transpired has been unsettling to say the least for me and my family over the last few weeks. Life is short and unexpected so make sure to make the most of it, let people you care for know what they mean to you, and never let work get you too down. I hope you can take something away from my experience so far in PA.",

I know many might not consider this a serious issue, and I do not wish to make light of this issue but I'm in need of help due to a couple of hurtful comments made by my coworker with regards to race.\n\nI'm afraid of getting into the details of the situation here but I\"m facing issues because 1) I'm a male and the system is absent from helping us with whatever mental health problems we have 2) I'm a minority - while the system has gotten better to help minorities in general, I have an ethnic name and I feel that if I make a complaint to HR, I could get fired.  It's very hard for me to find a job with my ethnic name.\n\nI'm just briefly going to say that a female coworker made a couple of comments about a certain race that I visibly resemble that has a negative stereotype in society.  Those comments were negative.  I spoke to the manager about this and she brought us together over a zoom call where the coworker apologized.  That coworker has now been promoted to supervisor.\n\nThere are times where I just cannot focus on my job due to her comments.  I have had thoughts about quitting my job or thoughts about suicide because I didn't feel like my career was progressing.  I'm hurt and I'm depressed, but I try to be as friendly, pleasant and happy as I can be to ensure that the signs of depression are not visibly seen.\n\nI don't know where to go from here without being put on the spotlight to get fired by HR.  I feel alone.  I don't want to blame any race (white, black, brown, Asian).  White people have come a long way to help minorities get adjusted.

    "text": "Do you think it would be socially acceptable for a man to wear discrete piercings in an office environment? Where I live, clothing policies were very strict and formal when I started working 10 years ago. I had to wear a suit and a tie in Big 4 audit; firm policy, no casual fridays.\n\nNow, 10 years after that, most offices are smart casual, even Big 4. It has become acceptable for anyone to visibly show discrete tattoos. Today I was in the gym and 80% of other guys also have piercings. My point is, this has become very common among people my age and our generation is the bulk of the workforce from entry-level to senior positions. Women get these big nape tattoos and no one bats an eye. I had a manager with a dragon tattoo on his arm when I was in public. But piercings are still taboo for men.\n\nI love my face jewelry, I'm willing to use discrete black or transparent jewelry. But my discrete black jewelry look like moles. My monroe piercing looks like a realistic mole if I use a small black stud. Same with tragus, nostril, helix, lobe, etc. **What are your thoughts, am I fucked or should I just do whatever I want with my face?** I'm a good worker, according to most reviews.\n\nBasically I've gotten a fuckton of piercings because of lockdown and all offices being closed for a year (where I live). I won't set foot in an office for at least 12 more months, maybe even next year. And even like that people will still be required to wear a mask, which could conceal half my piercings.\n\nGot a septum, a monroe and a nostril in the face. 2 lobes, 2 tragus and 2 lower helixes on ears.",

    "text": "First Week as Director of Finance in a small non-profit Good Evening everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst up I am going to cross post this to a couple reddits since it does not seem to have a specific place that is perfect for it, if you have a suggestion of another reddit to post it to that would be better please let me know!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBit of background:\n\nI started a position as director of finance for a small (5 staff, 50 faculty) non-profit this week. There is no direct handover of duties from the previous director who left about a month before I started.  The CEO has enough experience with the systems to work through the payrolls in between and some bills were paid but not entered anywhere.  With the small staff I will be managing everything from basic bookkeeping to working with the finance committee of the board. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Current plan\n\nI am going to focus on getting the items entered that were missed, learn how to do payroll and process that and then close the month of March since that has not happened yet.  After that I want to get through to the audit at fiscal year end in June.  Beyond that I would like to make some larger changes but that is for some other post in the future. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Questions:\n\n1. Where would you start?  There is a ton of information to take in and a lot of work to be caught up on.  What would you start with?\n2. What would you plan to do in the first week? Month? Year?\n3. Does anyone have any experience with the BlackBaud program Financial Edge? 99% of my experience is with quick books and sage. Any tips or tricks for this program would be appreciated. It is an older version since they have not paid to keep up with it, 7.8 I believe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would greatly appreciate any help and all thoughts and ideas are welcomed!",

    "text": "1L on leave of absence after experiencing 2 mental breakdowns. My parents are livid and I;m terrified. My story goes back, way back. I was diagnosed with depression when I was 14 and prescribed Prozac, but I stopped taking it within a year after my family urged me to stop and after a suicide attempt where I tried to overdose on my medicine. In spring 2019 of my 3rd year of university, I attended LSAT prep night classes while going to school during the day. I was trying to get a double major but dropped the second one by the end of the school year since the school barely had enough courses to complete it and I didn't want to continue on to a 5th year. During that time, I fainted from low blood pressure on a bus ride to school once and ended up losing around 20 pounds from stress. I took the first digital LSAT that summer and cancelled my score since it was a 149, way below my target score. During the fall semester of my final year of uni I focused on my courses so I could maintain a decent GPA while working part-time; my mom would always call me to ask if I was studying for the LSAT and I either evaded the question or lied and said I would once I finished my regular coursework for the night. I decided that once the spring semester started I would study for the LSAT since I only had two easy classes to take with few meeting times.\n\nAs everyone is aware, 2020 had a rough start. Looking back I probably had a relapse into my depression after receiving my LSAT score. I didn't study for the LSAT at all and just stayed in bed once I got back to my apartment. When my mom called to ask me how studying for the LSAT was going I would snap at her and even hang up my phone. Come March I wasn't ready for the April LSAT at all, so I was relieved when it got cancelled due to COVID. I told my mom that I would take the test later during the year and spend my time studying and working. She was not pleased to say the least. My parents would spend days screaming at me, calling me a deadbeat for working at the local Target instead of trying to get a job that was more prestigious and used my bachelor's degree (I majored in Human Geography) and my infrequent studying. I broke down and told them I didn't want to go to law school anymore, and stayed with grandma to study at her house. My aunt and grandma convinced me to go back home a few weeks later, but I started slacking on my studying until I just stopped once the holiday rush started at work.\n\n2021 and my mom is yelling at me and calling me a deadbeat who achieved nothing in 2020. So I buckled down and studied for real. I would study for a few hours before work and study some more once I came home from work and even during the weekends. I managed to get up to 160 on some practice tests and could answer three sections correct on logic games, which used to be my weakness. I felt ready for the April 2021 LSAT. Then, on the day of the test, I had a panic attack in the very first section, logic games to add insult to injury. I had heart palpitations so intense I was practically punching my chest to calm down. By the end of the section I just wanted to shut down my laptop and run away, but I powered through the test and finished. I was absolutely sure that I bombed it so I drank as much Vodka as I could and got black out drunk. I vaguely remember my younger sister and cousin picking me up off the kitchen floor and helping me walk upstairs to my bedroom. I haven't swallowed a single drop of alcohol since then.\n\nI got my LSAT score in late April. It was 151, I never even scored that low on my practice tests. I decided applying to schools would be pointless and I should retake the test, but my mom encouraged me to apply to some law schools. I got rejected from one school, which was also my top choice I was dreaming of attending, I got put on the waitlist at another, and I finally got accepted at one school. I won't say any names, but the school has a 55% bar passage rate and in 2020 the ABA warned them they could lose accreditation if they couldn't raise their bar rate. I was nervous about attending the school, even with the scholarship they gave me, but my mom said I could work hard in my first year and transfer out. I talked to my mentor and a friend who already works in the legal field and they said they knew people who went to lower ranked law schools and transferred to better schools after their 1L year. \n\nSchool started in August and I started out fine enough, my only concern was that I learned law school worked on a different grading curve. There were only a certain amount of As to be given so students who put in A-level effort weren't guaranteed to get an A. I told myself I would try my best to be one of the few who got an A. By the 3rd week of school I stopped reading and struggled to complete assignments, at times I just didn't turn in any assignments. I stopped eating and only ate once a day so I wouldn't get hunger pangs and headaches. Once classes ended I went straight to my apartment and climbed into bed; watching the sun go down outside my window until I could fall asleep. I called my mother after my first breakdown and she got me connected with a psychiatrist that prescribed Zoloft to me. I told the Dean of Student Affairs about my suicidal ideations, and he set up an appointment with a therapist program affiliated with the school. I ended up spending the night at the local hospital on suicide watch. \n\nI tried to get back into the groove of things, but I still struggled to read and do my assignments despite talking to a therapist and the Dean of Student Affairs once a week. I had my 2nd breakdown when 1Ls were notified to have a mandatory meeting with career services to discuss pro bono work and looking for summer internships and jobs. I wasted my first 2 months of law school depressed and ruining my grade; I was scared that I would flunk the semester and be stuck at a school on the verge of losing accreditation or that after graduating I would struggle to find work since employers would judge me for going to a low tier school. I told my mom I wanted to withdraw and seek more intensive out patient care and enter with the winter class, and she accused me of wanting to run away from law school by entering a facility. Choice words were said, including me saying my mom just wanted me to stay in a school so she could bragging about how her daughter was in law school, even if it's a bad law school.\n\nAfter talking to relatives, the Dean of Student Affairs, my professors, my mentor, and friends, I decided it was in my best interest to take a leave of absence and retake the LSAT to see if I could get into a better school while I still could; if that failed I would come back to my current school and try Plan B - getting top grades so I could transfer out. When I told my parents, as the title said, they were livid. They told me I was taking the easy way out and that since I knew nothing about struggle that I thought I could reset when life doesn't work that way. My father said he refuses to pay for my rent and my mom is flip flopping between saying she'll pay for my rent but once my lease ends I'm on my own or that I need to find a job to pay for my father's half of the rent. She also demands that I find a way to end my lease prematurely so I can come back home so they aren't wasting money on me since I'm not in law school anymore. I have some money saved from working since high school so I can pay for rent until March without working; I plan to take the January LSAT so if I manage to pull up my score I plan to work so I don't drain my savings.\n\nMy mom is a nurse practitioner and says that professionals don't care where I went to school, but my mentor, cousin, and friend that's been a lawyer for 5 years says that the legal field is still a bit elitist and I should follow my heart. My friend is fluent in Cantonese and Japanese and passed the New York bar exam. She had to move to Japan for family reasons and was applying to law firms there; a recruiter told her that because of her academic background they didn't think she was qualified to work there. She ended up getting an in-house job in Sega's legal department, but hearing that scared me since her school is leagues above my current school. That just cemented that the school I go to ***does*** matter, and I want to go ahead and try taking the LSAT before I end up ruining my future. Just like how retaking the LSAT doesn't guarantee I will be accepted to a new school, I'm not guaranteed an A in school and a transfer to a better school. After this long spiel, I just want some advice. How do I convince my parents that I'm not giving up on law school? That I can pull up my LSAT score and get into a better school?",

    "text": "Yes, you do need an “If I go missing...” folder. Hello Ladies,\n\nIf you follow the news, I’m sure most of you at this point have heard about the murder of Sarah Everard. As a woman, it hurt to be reminded that even if you “do the right things”, someone can still take your life. \n\nAs a Black woman, it has been another reminder that we have to be our own advocates if we go missing. We will never have the same press coverage, we will never have the same demands for change. \n\nIn the event that you go missing, whether as a result of someone else or an accident, you need to have an “If I go missing” folder that will allow your family or close friends to get started on search efforts. Do not expect the police to even believe you are missing as they may decided that there isn’t enough proof and that you’ve simply left on your own. \n\nSo what should be in an “If I go missing...” folder?\n\n1. General information such as your name, commonly used nicknames, locations you frequently visit, routes you generally take, and general appearance description. Be sure to note any dental work that could be used to identify you. \n\n2. Usernames and passwords to all banking accounts plus a list all of credit / debit cards in your name. All of them. This will allow them to quickly find if your card has recently been used and where. EDIT: If comfortable, use a password management solution so that your information is never at risk for being accidentally stolen or accessed. There are several options and they are easy to configure and use. Remember, any sensitive information you have should be stored securely and not somewhere where it could be accidentally accessed or stolen. Whether that’s passwords, birth certificates, or social security cards. \n\n3. Recent photos of you. With and without makeup. Have all angles of your face, full body, and photos of items that are unique to you. People may not remember a face, but they may remember complimenting something you always wear. \n\n4. List of known associates. Coworkers, neighbors, that person you chat with at the store. List your personal connections and be sure to note any that should be of concern to your family. If you don’t know the individual, still say something like “Sometimes there’s a weird guy at the corner when I’m walking to work.”\n\n5. List of medications and your prescribing doctors. \n\n6. A list of things you would *never* do. Leave your children, be in a car alone with XYZ, etc. If there is anything that would be an immediate red flag to your family and friends, put it in there.\n\n7. Personal account login information. Social media, gaming, all of it. In the event you go missing and there isn’t an immediate lead, you want your family to be able to get access to those accounts without having to jump through hoops that could take weeks or months. EDIT: Again, try to use a password management solution that allows you to securely share access, if possible. \n\n8. DNA. Now you can’t really put this in a folder, but try to share the location of stored DNA. You can actually use some kits to store your DNA in your freezer should the need ever arise. This can especially be useful for families where some members may be adopted. If you can’t or don’t want to store DNA, then try to note your blood type.\n\n9. Fingerprint card and copies of all your IDs. Work, state, etc. \n\n10. Final notes to your loved ones. This can be a hard one. No one ever wants to think about the day they might not be here, but if you can, write any final notes or thoughts you’d want them to know, in the event you go missing and are not found. \n\nFinally, let’s talk about what to expect if you or someone you know has gone missing. First, the burden of proof will be on you to show that they are missing and didn’t leave of their own free will. Sometimes the police will care, but often they will not simply due to the number of missing reports that resolve themselves. Their lack of interest will rarely be malicious. It will simply be from being overworked, understaffed, underfunded, and leaning too much on “what normally happens”.\n\nSaying “this isn’t like them” isn’t enough. You need to be specific. Have they neglected to show up for an appointment? Have you already gone by their house? Is anything missing or out of place? Are they on a medication that if they missed taking could cause some serious consequence (e.g insulin).\n\nIf you are even slightly suspicious of foul play, you have to advocate for the person with all that you have. \n\nIf you or the person who has gone missing is:\n\nAddicted to drugs, has previously gone missing but was later found, says things like “I’m going to go away”, or has a history of disappearing without a word, then you must be prepared to be on your own. Still go to the police, but if they find any records to suggest they’ve left before on their own, they will likely assume that is what’s happening this time. \n\nIf you are that person, have that folder and have your “I would never” line. Something that lets your family and friends know that this isn’t the norm. If you know someone who is like that, then encourage them to make their own folder and also have their “never” line. \n\nLuckily, going missing or having a missing loved isn’t something most of us will ever have to go through, but because we live in the country that we do, we have to be prepared to help ourselves should anything happen. Make one for you, your family, and encourage friends to make one for themselves. Keep the information secure but easily accessible should the time come.\n\nStay safe out there, ladies!",

    "text": "Falsely accused of stealing while at work Hello guys (TLDR at the bottom) . I'm in need of advice! I'm in a very tough situation. On Saturday I was falsely accused of stealing while working. I work at a retail store that sells clothes, makeup accessories etc. I've been working at this specific location for 4 months but worked for this company for 3 years as a whole. While I was working I was called over by one of my managers. She told me Alice  (another manager) and her wanted to have a word with me. I also want to note that Alice seemed very mad at me and I had noticed her watching me during that shift that day. (Both managers are asian) \n\nThey told me to follow them and took me to a private room. I had no idea what they pulled me over for. They both stood there in front of me and Sharon the one that called me over told me to empty out my pockets. I was a bit shocked. I followed as was said and emptied out my pockets. I showed them that my front and back pockets pockets were empty apart from the NYX lipstick I had in my pocket (one I was wearing that day) . They both seemed a bit surprised. They seemed to of expected for me to of stolen a lipstick from their company. (Which btw is literally sold for £1 so why would I bother stealing their low quality makeup? I don't own a single makeup product from the company I work at) . \n\nSharon then said \"Oh! Well Alice said she saw you put something from the makeup department into your pocket while doing the returns (putting clothes/ items back onto the shop floor) . Alice seemed extremely embarrassed I see her turning red. She was very quiet the whole time. I feel like if you have the guts to make such a big accusation you should have the guts to be the one saying it!\n\nSharon then had the audacity to ask me \"Do you know where to put the items when doing returns?\" \"Yes, I put them back onto the shop floor...\" such a dumb question asking as if the n*gga chip inside of me would suddenly activate and cause for me to steal. I've been returning clothes onto the shop floor for months with no issues for months!\n\nWhat really grinded my gears was that Sharon ended things saying \"Well, next time just make sure to not put that in your pocket incase it causes another misunderstanding\" . Basically making it seem like I caused this \"misunderstanding\" and projecting the blame onto me instead admitting THEY were in the wrong. When they falsely accused me! I just ended things saying that I've gotta go to my break.\n\nThis situation has left me feeling so upset and angry. Everytime I as a black person walk into a store I worry about people thinking I'm going to steal. I worry about the most innocent actions I make may be perceived as being suspicious. I worry about potentionally being falsely accused of stealing and that's EXACTLY what happened today. I never thought that I'd have to worry about this at a place I worked at. \n\nI talked to 5 other people and they quickly said racism and felt like race played a part in this accusation. I talked to 4 other black people and 1 Asian guy. I just don't know what to do. I feel saddened especially since I wasn't even given the benefit of the doubt. There is literally nothing about me, my character, my work ethic, the way I dress that would've ever indicated that I was the type of person to steal. Nothing apart from the fact that I'm black. I can't help but wonder what if it was a white coworker doing the same thing? Would anyone's mind quickly jump to stealing? Or would it of just been brushed aside and given the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI know some people will say this has nothing to do with race but black people are constantly being falsely accused of stealing! We're more likely to be falsely accused of stealing something that turned out to be our own belongings. What do you guys think? Do you think race potentionally played a part in influencing this assumption? I know that people have unconscious racial biases/stereotypes ingrained in them that influences how they see black people that they may not be consciously aware of.\n\nI saw Alice on the shop floor afterwards and she has not said a word to me since. Sharon tried to awkwardly sweep things under the rug by doing her job and giving me orders to do as normal. Neither have apologised.\n\nWhat would you do if you were in my position? Would you quit or keep going to work and move on? I already hated this job before this situation happened. They overwork us, always understaffed and the pay is only minimum wage. The only thing that I like about the job are the people I work with. I enjoy talking to them while I'm there. However this situation has left me in tears for days and feeling very uncomfortable.\n\nTLDR; Got accused of stealing at work by 2 Asian female managers at work. Called me me to empty out my pockets only to find out they were wrong and have since not apologised and have attempted to sweep things under the rug by acting normal and projecting the blame onto me.",

    "text": "PSA: Document everything and ask for things in writing. As black women in the workforce it’s not news to anyone here that management will almost always try to try us. Long story short, new white lady department manager started at my old job and decided she didn’t like me from day 1. She tried to gaslight me into thinking I had “automatically resigned” from my position by completing an internal interview for a different department. I asked for a termination letter which deaded that real quick. After that debacle I took the hint, looked for and found a better job that pays significantly more, and tendered my resignation. This woman decided she couldn’t leave well enough alone, so she pulled me into the office halfway through my notice period and told me it’s best for us to “part ways here” and that she would pay me for my remaining scheduled hours. Say less, BYE! 👋🏾\n\nOf course I didn’t trust her so I sent her a recap email immediately after the discussion, pointedly thanking her for promising me severance. No response. Fast forward to payday and—predictably—nothing hits my account. I keep it cool (could be an honest oversight), reach out to HR to try and get it sorted out. I’m not there anymore nor privy to what was said but I’m assuming she tried to tell them she didn’t know what I was talking about because they kept trying to avoid my emails and phone calls for over a week. That was until I called the Head of Accounting, explained the situation to him and softly threatened legal action. Immediately after the phone call I forwarded the recap email I had sent my former manager to both him and HR. Three hours after that, they said that they would pay me for the hours AND my unused accrued PTO that previously they had told me I wasn’t entitled to per their PTO payout policy (hadn’t worked there long enough to qualify for payout).\n\nTL;DR Management are not your friends, *especially* not if you’re a black woman. Verbal threats and promises mean nothing. If they are doing anything “official” with regards to you and not documenting it, it’s because it is in their best interest not to do so. Ask for things in writing. Document things as factually and objectively as possible, with names dates and times. If they are writing you up for something and you know it’s BS, document your own version of events on the write up prior to signing it. If you live in a one party consent state, go one step further and record one-on-one conversations with management (there’s phone apps with which you can do this). Do whatever you can to protect your own interests in the workplace via written communication because they are certainly protecting theirs.",

    "text": "Sharing an office with the only white woman in the entire building This is HARD. Probably one of the hardest things I've ever had to deal with because, at this point, I'm ready to throw hands. The passive aggressive disrespect is at an all time high and its all because I don't care to make friends with this woman. It started the first day I arrived. We started the same day and they had me at her desk because she didn't have all her paperwork to start. When she arrived, I was in the process of moving my stuff over to my REAL desk space. She comes into the office, looks at me up and down and aggressively said \" THIS IS MY DESK!\" from there its been down hill from here. Im in a higher position than she is so it makes some sense as to why she act the way she does. She started gossiping to me and I had to let her know that I dont like gossip. She types VERY aggressively and its becoming a distraction for me as well. I began putting my headphones on and keeping to myself and my work load. She began to complain to her manager about that. (my manager is her manager's manager and we are all black women). As she started to complain about me not talking to her throughout the day, I began to notice that she was doing petty antics to get my attention, get a rise out of me, and/or get me to respond in a way she believed black women would (angry and aggressive). She hid files from me, interrupted conversations I had with others, stole items from my desk, and many other petty things. I finally addressed her when she came in and rolled her eyes, grunted like a man and said GOOD MORNING. I expressed to her in a calm, professional, and soft tone because thats me. Im not aggressive unless I have to be. She explained to me that she felt I was being cold, distant, and wasnt acknowledging her by saying GOOD MORNING or Goodnight. It was all a complete lie. because i had no reason to recluse (at the time). She told me I was being confrontational in our talk even though I was being soft, professional, n straightforward. From there, we had a meeting with her manager because my manager was out of office. She was FRAZZLED in that meeting and almost demanded for us not to work together in any setting. That didnt go the way she wanted and I set clear boundaries to be respected in order for us to co exist in the office. weeks later, she decides she no longer wants to respect my boundaries. At this point, I stopped interacting with her completely. I stopped saying hello, goodbye and kept it strictly about work. She is still complaining about me and now we are going to have a meeting with my manager about expectations. My manager is VERY supportive; the best manager Ive ever had! She understands what im going through. However, nothing is changing and at this point Im scared. Scared of things being stolen from me, something put in my food, my desk being tampered with, and I just dont trust her at all. I dont know what to do. I dont think there is any office I can move to. Im TIRED!!!!  I understand she wants to possibly be friends, but this isnt the way you handle it. and why would you want to be friends with me when you CLEARLY don't like me?  I made this as short as possible because I cant even remember all the things she has done COVERTLY. Everything she does is documented and I share it with my manager if there are any updates. PLESAE HELP ME FIND  A RESOLVE or possibly help me understand how I can keep my peace, and completely ignore her. There are times she gets on my last nerve and it frustrates me that she got to me. PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME! :( at this point I want to quit. I feel like I may not be getting the support I deserve despite my very amazing manager.",

    "text": "Making Black Female Friends Has anyone else had trouble/issues making Black female friends as a Black woman? \n\nI really didn't have as much of a hard time with it until late high school, despite growing up in yt areas. I've been used to being the only Black person or one of the few Black people in my majority yt school. When I would try to befriend the other Black kids in my AP classes, who I'm thinking are probably going through the same things I am, they *hated* me and bullied me for allegedly thinking I was \"better\" than them, being \"uppity\" or that I was \"trying to be white\" because of how I spoke. One girl actually tried to pull my hair once. Another girl I almost got into a fight with because I was tired of how she treated me. I ended up having more yt friends and best friends as they seemed to be more welcoming of me, but of course, there's still that level of distance and danger that's there because they don't fully understand your experiences and many of them came from ultra conservative households-- so I was hyper aware that I was the \"Black exception\" friend instead of \"Sally's friend.\"\n\nI have found even in the workplace it's not that much better-- the only Black (female) supervisors I've had made my life hell because I wasn't from the same side of town as them and made low key hateful comments about my interests or the clothes I wore (a mix of things from Target, LOFT or some J. Crew, but just general professional attire) or a bag I wore. They would play games with me and mess with my time off pay to force me to either work during the time I requested off or make me go unpaid because I \"could afford it\" when they didn't know my budget or finances. They'd block me from mentorships and opportunities within the company but also hated that the (largely mediocre and unimpressive) yt coworkers were friendly with me. It's not like these women weren't educated or accomplished; they were in middle management positions and they went to school. So I chalked it up to nasty crabs in a bucket mentality and left. \n\nA lot of these behaviors seems to translate in social situations too-- there's the lowkey comments about me being \"rich\" or being a \"valley girl\" or about the way I dress or what I wear and how I speak. (Pre pandemic) I would go to women's meetups and hangouts and would open myself up to talking to the Black ladies there-- like literally flock to them because hey! we out here! And they'd.... kind of dismiss me for various arbitrary reasons. Same with trying to join a grad chapter for a sorority. I don't know what it is there to prove that I'm unambiguously Black and interested in them but I feel like the onus is largely on me to prove that to be accepted when I'm just being myself.\n\nOn the other hand, I do find it quite curious though, that my older sister and I grew up in the same environment for the most part, speak the same, and she dresses in designer threads. But she's always had predominately Black friends or POC friends as well as boyfriends, whereas mine have been more yt leaning. I feel like she's more grounded in her Blackness and I'm working on it because it's like...yes, I love indie rock music and concerts, ballet dancing, hiking, insert whatever stereotypical yt hobby etc. and have relaxed hair (just like my sister) but I was still raised in an all Black family with Black parents  with Black culture and history that I love and embrace. Even without all of that, I'm still a Black woman living a Black experience.\n\nTL;DR On one hand, I feel like I am \"not Black enough\" for the Black women I've encountered/tried to befriend, and they become very vicious with me because they find my hobbies, the way I speak, how I look etc. to be \"yt pandering\" or \"uppity\" yet it's not always comforting or mutual to have yt friends either because, at least in my experience, they don't even try to understand my cultural experiences. I also am straight up done with being/feeling like a token. While we may share the same hobbies and interests, my yt friends have been openly dismissive of how I and other Black people are treated in society. I have learned over so many times how dangerous it is to have close yt friends and have accepted that but at the same time, I don't want to give up on my community either.

I knew MN racism was really bad at my core but you get gaslighted so much here that you start questioning your reality. People act like there is no racism here because \"people are so nice.\" White fragility is real here... like narcissists, white people act racist, deny it, make themselves the victims, then put the blame on you. They are so passive aggressive that the racism is so subtle, ex: moving away from you out of fear like you are this big threat. I am a woman and I've learned to keep a lot of physical distance from white women and to not make eye contact---which by the way, is super offensive as a feminine woman. If you aren't going out of your way to be super friendly and make them comfortable, you are a threat. I have had my own white relatives act suspicious of me for visiting and trying to get to know  them. I have always felt so isolated being a higher educated middle class black mixed woman. I've been treated as a criminal by my own employers. One time I walked into my first therapy job and the co-workers spoke to my white supervisor instead of me---they were so shocked and uncomfortable when they found out I was the therapist. The social class and job discrimination is so strong here, they are shocked to see professional black people. Being around all this white supremacy makes you question yourself and internalize their messages... You question your sanity, if you are bad, the problem.. when really they are the problem. They have the history of stealing and killing all groups of people for centuries but somehow they see themselves as the victims. White narcissistic delusion.\n\nThere also isn't much of a community of black professionals. From my experience, there are a lot of black (especially mixed) people who are in denial and will gaslight you about racism, too. I have had a lot of bad experiences with mixed black people who are in denial of their blackness, talk about how they pass for other races, and allign with whiteness. They distance themselves from their blackness and some seem delusional because they do not see that they do look part black.\n\nIt seems like the black/mixed people who make it to the top are the ones who have assimilated, have internalized racism, are not unified with other black people, and have had to swallow the racism they have had to experienced. I could not do that for long without it eating me up. I spoke up for myself and others. As humans, we are not supposed to be abused and just take it.. but somehow as black people, white people see us as less than human and think we are immuned and should just take it.\n\nI am burnt out. I barely leave the house. White people are everywhere here and I don't trust most. When I am around them, I dissociate to avoid feeling the pain of all of their violent \"microaggressions.\" Thankfully for now, I work at a black business. Moving out of this state is mandatory for my sanity. I wish all black people could leave as well. It is hard to succeed and progress here without losing a part of yourself. At least I know I managed to survive (and suceeded educationally and built resiliency) one of the most racist states, it can only get better from here as I move on to a more equitable state.\n\n[Racial Disparity MN pic](https://www.zippia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/racial_disparity_map_worst_states.jpg)",

I grew up in a fairly Republican/Conservative area of NYC (Staten Island) in which white people were the majority.\n\nMy parents loved me but they had no idea how to deal with raising a multiracial son. They were stern and strict and did not believe in a coddling love. They did, however, believe in the merits of education and made sure that I knew to bring the best grades home. In school, other students stayed away from me. They were polite as young children but they often ostracized me and left me out of activities. At the time I didn't know it was because of how I looked but with time I began to see the relationship. I learned the power of being a fool, of being self-depreciating. As people laughed at me, I saw it as their acceptance. What I had actually done was prime them to note my difference, my mixed-race status, as being something comical, something to decry, deride, and deplore.\n\nI became the class clown and stood to make problems for the sake of other's entertainment. Teachers began to hate me and associate me as a problem child. They suggested mental and learning disabilities despite my high grades due to my parents and their iron fist approach to education. With every letter home, phone call, parent-teacher conference, I would receive a beating from my parents. Slaps in the face, beatings with belts, name calling, screaming in a child's face, bruises on my body. All done for the sake of being accepted by my peers. All for the sake of being loved by someone. I learned that people who love you are allowed to do whatever they want to your body so I let others do what they wanted to me. Friends treated me like a punching bag. At the age of 8 my 13 year-old babysitter blackmailed me into allowing her to rape me. I said nothing, scared more at the idea that I would be in trouble if people knew I had sex because I knew enough to know sex was wrong.\n\nBy the time I was 12 in middle school, I had tried to hurt myself for the first time. I was taken to the guidance counselor because I had told a friend who, doing the right thing, told an adult. In the process, I was treated like I was crazy. I was threatened to be committed because I was a danger to myself. All of this made me feel *different* and I already knew *different* was bad. I knew because of how I felt when people told me I was different. \"What are you?\" \"Who is black?\" \"How did that happen?\" \"Are you \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?\" The looks of confusion. Even worse was the looks of incredulity, like the fact that I existed couldn't be real. People, regardless of their own race, made me feel so ugly. Ugly because I was different, unique, and beautiful because of my uniqueness.\n\nI knew my parents' union was odd because people told me that. But I didn't know the history of miscegenation in America. I did not know that it was once a crime to be us or to engage in a union that results in the creation of one of us. What I did experience, however, was fetishization as I grew up and became sexually active again. I had a hard time finding someone who thought we had enough of a connection to date one another. When I did, I immediately agreed to date them, I was thirsty for love and affection. But this love was ugly too because it was different. This was even present in friendships. I had friends who told me they would only date black girls because they were black and wanted to have black babies. I had friends who told me I was smart because I was Asian and knew some rap and had rhythm because my mom was Black.\n\nMy girlfriends never, ever brought me home. I was a secret, forever to be hidden. I grew attached to a concept that white girls were the most beautiful. This was partially because of where I grew up but also out of jealousy. White people had such an ownership of their heritage. They knew what they were and forged relationships based on those identities. I wanted so badly to be white. I told my mother that I liked white girls and that in my next life I'd like to be white because they rule the world. My hatred of my blackness stemmed from the fact that society deemed black inferior which led me to believe that my blackness was probably why my interactions with society were so awful. If only I were fully Asian or White and had no blackness to me. I didn't realize it was just because I was mixed. The one girlfriend who took me home only told her family I was Asian. During the death of Eric Garner on Staten Island as racial tensions spilled out onto the streets, I visited her family and had to grimace as they joked about, \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\". She said nothing. She did nothing. I didn't expect her to.\n\nMy life spiraled out of control as I got older and race became more important as a qualifier in making connections with people. I fell in deep love with a girl from a family who practiced the Islamic faith. She had difficulties accepting her role in the religion and found solace in me, a person with no ties to any culture because my culture was so shattered by my being multiracial. She would often tell me how \"cool\" it was that I was Black and Asian. How \"attractive\" it was. I didn't know what she was doing was fetishizing me, I was desperate to believe she loved me. After a few years, the relationship fell apart and, again, it was because I was different. This time, however, I knew it was because of my race. I never hated myself so much in my life. I cursed myself and my family, I wished I could be one thing.\n\nI drank a lot after the breakup. I wanted to die. I woke up face down in the gutter one night after binge-drinking. I tried to slice my wrists in my backyard, then I tried to fall on the knife. I tried to jump off the overpass by my house into traffic. I wanted my death to be certain. I gained so much weight my heartbeat became erratic. I was smoking a pack a day and developed a wheeze. I hated myself, I needed to punish myself. I fought my father, I ran away from home and became homeless. I hurt and hurt and hurt because love seemed impossible because acceptance was impossible.\n\nI became a teacher. First in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn where my students, forever ready to curse me out and let me know when I wasn't being \"fair\", accepted me. Almost instantly. They asked what I was, were relieved when they heard \"Black\" because they knew we shared something common, and then made me one of their own. They joked with me, told me gossip, shared their fears, shared their dreams and their emotions. They asked me to share my stories and for the first time, **ever**, someone wanted to truly know me. Now I teach in the South Bronx where my students have yet to ask me what I am. Because it does not matter to them.\n\nI began a journey to heal. I lost weight though exercise, something I was so hesitant to do because I hated myself and wanted to die. I took a road trip from NY to Georgia, across to New Orleans, Louisiana then to Texas, then Cali. I got to see the Pacific Ocean and looked across to imagine my father's country. We drove back and I was refreshed with a new look on life. I educated myself on race relations in America as BLM became a massive presence following the death of George Floyd and learned to love my blackness. I attended my first protest on Staten Island with BLM and learned the importance of being outspoken. I learned to love myself and I learned how to share that love with others. I challenged my perceptions of education and decided to dedicate my life towards bringing a sense of ownership when it comes to science for BIPOC students. By providing students with a more hands-on experience, they learn that science is a gift for all humanity in the form of a community, one that it is honorable to be a part of. I have since been selected to work on a committee that brings more diversity toward l\n\n**The Movement**\n\nThrough my research, I have become extremely disillusioned with the lack of support provided to people of mixed race. I grew up with no one to turn to, no one to help me unpack the burden of being an oddity to society. I left social media, angry, vowing to never use it again because I didn't want to interact with a society that could not accept me. I likened it to being desperate, to chasing the desire to belong to something that has no desire to accept me.\n\nI fell upon Beverly Daniel Tatum's national bestseller, \"Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together In The Cafeteria?\" and noted that it was revised and updated. I had never had interest in reading this book before, despite it being mentioned in conversations with friends, teachers, etc. I did not belong to the black culture and so social issues of segregation were particularly damning to me. How could I sympathize with a culture that told me I wasn't black or black enough? At least they had one another in their culture to lean on. I had no one, I felt. In the revised edition, Dr. Tatum places attention to the role that Multiracial families bring to a discussion of race relations in America. Yet, in one fell swoop, she manages to disenfranchise me and other mixed-raced people, \"Given the unique historical and contemporary context, it is the biracial identity development of children of Black and White parents that I will focus on here.\" (Tatum, 304) I was not even enough to garner attention by a champion of Civil Rights and Equality in a book that was groundbreaking in its ability to unpack race relations in my country. I began to wonder how many other mixed-race people felt this way.\n\nI realized that we are under-represented and our lack of support allows us to be targets for confusion. It is this confusion to what we are, to how people treat us, that results in self-hatred, self-depreciation, self-loathing, and self-harm. And we cannot wait for others to be our voice because we are in need. As more attention is being placed towards identifying racism throughout the world, we need to be vocal, we need to stand to let people know: WE ARE THE DISENFRANCHISED TOO. WE ARE PEOPLE TOO.\n\nAnd that has been the movement I've been slowly pushing over social media. I want it to take off. I want us to unify and represent a community that has lacked a true community for so long. #wearepeopletoo\n\nAs people, we deserve to be treated like others. This means we deserve the freedom to be equals in society. We deserve to walk down the street or to make a new friendship without being asked for our race or ethnicity because #wearepeopletoo. We deserve to love and be loved not fetishized because #wearepeopletoo. We deserve to feel like we belong in our families, in our schools, in our government, in our country because #wearepeopletoo.\n\nRight now, the movement is just a hashtag. But even the largest movements begin somewhere. I will not pretend to know what I am doing. I will not pretend to be a leader or to stand as someone to look up to. I believe that this movement needs to be decentralized. No single leader, just a group of people, human beings, who see the need for a change. Right now I am using IG to push the hashtag but I want to begin moving to other platforms, putting out writing, establishing a website. I hoped we could establish [r/mixedrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/mixedrace) as a basis for a headquarters or begin to discuss a place to brainstorm. I stand with all people of the world and I want them to begin to see us as people too. #wearepeopletoo I know I need help, I need teammates and a community to support and be supported by. Even now as I tell people my idea for this movement they tell me I am being divisive, that I am causing more division in the world. But this was division that was forced on me, not one that I created. My goal is to end this division. I share that belief, that one they call utopic, that the world will be better when we see ourselves as one race: the human race.\n\nThank you for hearing me out,\n\nDae",

    "text": "Male names face discrimination in hiring A report we created took together evidence and found that men generally face higher rates of discrimination in hiring when it comes to male vs. female names \\[1\\].\n\nHere are the research highlights:\n\nA male name is 13% less likely to be chosen than a female name for rental housing, and it goes as big of an anti-male gender gap as 33% in low-population areas for black male names vs. black female names (46% callback rate for men, and 79% callback rate for women) and male Muslim names are 50% less likely to be housed than female Muslim names. Comparatively, male names are less likely to be hired in female dominated jobs, and are 3.2% less likely to be hired than in blind hiring (vs. the 2.9% advantage women have). One study found that women were hired 2% less based off of their name, but it appeared to be biased, due to the fact that it only used 9 names and did not differentiate between lower class and higher class names. (If you look at the study you'll find that a male name, Jose Vazquez, had the highest negative response rate \\[13%\\] and nearly the lowest positive response rate \\[81%\\]. \\[2\\]) Female names are also possibly discriminated against in male-dominated jobs, as it depends on the job, for example a heavy-lifting job may be biased against them, but a STEM one is not (as they are biased towards 2:1 over EQUALLY or SLIGHTLY MORE qualified male candidates \\[3\\]).\n\n\\[1\\] Adams, Drew K.
