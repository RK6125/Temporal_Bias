    "text": "Job searching with mental health issues, name changes, and generally offputting work history? Hi guys. I need help regarding questions about my work history, because it's been very unstable due to some life changes and mental health issues, and I'm not sure how to go about anything anymore. I've been out of work for a few months now and it's time I start looking about getting back into the working life. My work history is a bit questionable, so I'll just start from the beginning of my professional career and go from there. \n\nI have a 2 year associates degree in electrical engineering (with a specialty in biomedical technology) and was hired at a hospital as a biomedical technician, basically someone that repairs and maintains medical equipment. I started as an entry level technician directly out of schooling, and was promoted to an intermediate level technician a couple years later. I worked for this employer for 3 years.\n\nI was fired from that job because I was caught sleeping on the job on more than one occasion. I was going through a major chronic depressive episode (I'm diagnosed major depressive disorder and bipolar 2) and was no longer able to preform the functions of the work. I was unemployed for one year following that, and found work at a small company that did field service work for the same thing (maintaining medical equipment for small doctor's offices and surgery centers around the state [Pennsylvania]). It was a small company owned by a man and his wife, and the only employees were me, one other gentleman, and the owners two daughters.\n\nI was fired from that job a year later, allegedly because I drove the company car to a Dr's appointment on my way home from work (and it was agreed that the car would never be used for personal reasons, so it is entirely my fault and I accept that).\n\nI was out of work for another year and figured I would give up on the professional side of my life for then and just find normal work. After all, being fired twice from the same position at two different companies puts a bad taste in a lot of engineer's mouths, so...\n\nI was hired a year after that job at a Sheetz here in Pennsylvania (a gas station / convenience store / restaurant, some are more familiar with Wawa which is kind of the same thing). I was with Sheetz for three years. I started as a janitor, then worked as a front house cashier/kitchen position, then promoted to Shift Manager and ran the night shift. I loved that job... almost more than my engineering positions. \n\nAnyway... During my time at Sheetz, I decided to medically transition (I'm MtF transgender, have been all my life, just never had a chance to finally transition). I went full time, changed my name and gender markers on all of my documentation, have been on hormones for nearly three years now and have been living full time as a passable woman for three years. Sheetz was incredible during my transition and I had zero issues with them as a company, nor from my coworkers and bosses.\n\nHere's where most of my problems come in. My wife and I split up and are divorcing after an 11 year marriage, and I have four children. This past June, my children moved out to live with their mother full time in Nebraska (again I'm in Pennsylvania), and this caused me to become incredibly, majorly depressed and suicidal. I began cutting and have massive scars on my left arm, and spent most of this past summer in various mental inpatient units due to being severely suicidal. \n\nI took FMLA leave and was on short term disability for a few months while all this was happening. When I got released from the hospital and finally returned to work at Sheetz, I only lasted a few days before I realized if I kept working, I was going to either wind up back in the hospital, or be dead. My mental health has been very.... shaky, and it was incredibly difficult for me to return to work, run a team, deal with customers, and just generally be around the knives that I used to try to kill myself months before. So I wound up quitting that job, after three years.\n\nI'm at the point now where I think I'm ok, I'm a bit more stable than I was, but I still have many mental health issues that are making re-entering society a difficult matter. But sitting around stewing about it all isn't going to make things better, and I need to just get back out there and force myself to get better, because sitting around doing nothing all day isn't helping.\n\nI want to get back into a semi-professional field, and there are plenty of electro-mechanical  jobs around here, like maintaining and repairing things like food manufacturing equipment and what not. My problems are these:\n\nHow do I explain to potential employers about why I was fired from my only two professional jobs? And the year long depressive gap between them both?\n\nHow do I explain that I worked those jobs as a man? I really don't want to just flat out tell the employers that I'm trans and give them my old information, but I feel it's almost impossible not to. I'll just have to accept this one and bite the pain back I think.\n\nHow do I explain that I left my last job due to mental health reasons? That I could not emotionally and mentally handle the work or the environment? How is that in ANY way not going to send up a million red flags for the employer?\n\nI also have no professional references, only a couple managerial ones from my time at Sheetz. When a prospective job contacts my previous employers, am I just going to have to grit my teeth and hope they're not told horrible information? I'm not a bad employee, I just had some troubling times. \n\nI feel like anywhere I apply is just going to look at me like a total basket case and not even want to bother giving me a chance. \n\nSorry this post is so long, I really don't know what to do, or where to go.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice you give me. \n-L",

    "text": "How to market myself 42/F I have 19 years of professional experience.  I've been looking for a job since February of this year. \n\nMy last professional job was in network engineering but that was just an aspect of what I did - the bulk of the job was data driven resource allocation management.   I worked big projects (as a lead) and what I did encompassed a lot of areas - project management, data analysis, computer programming/scripting, working with databases, and doing data visualization - all of which centered around the management of network resources.   The actual job I did was very niche, and doesn't really exist outside of large internet companies.    I don't want to return to telecom because it was a very tough environment to work in as a woman.  I was thinking that these skills can be applied pretty broadly, but when I go to interviews (mostly for analytics/BI) more often than not the interviewers don't seem to understand how my skills are related to the job they have.   I think when I start talking about network resources people just check out.\n\nAdditionally, I think a large part of the problem is that I don't have all the \"flashy marketing\" terms on my resume because my work in telecom didn't involve any of the high level tools that a lot of companies use.    For example a lot of companies will use things like PowerBI for data modeling, but at my old role we just used programming and Excel for data modeling.  I used Tableau for data visualization, but basically everything else I did was through script programming.   So for example when I get a question like \"what did you use for data modeling\" the answer really is, \"we just made a model\".  Basically I have tons of experience doing things \"the hard way\" whereas companies are trying to do things \"the easier way\" by using tools.  I have experience with the process but not with the tools.  \n\nI think it may be that I'm presenting too abstract of a picture for employers to see my value.     Any tips or help would be greatly appreciated.   I'm happy to share more details.",

    "text": "Should I share my upcoming wedding? My in-person interview went very well and I pretty much got the job. I have a follow-up phone interview to discuss logistics and other details. I am getting married in November. In my current job, I have very flexible hours; I can work from home, I can leave early, or take days off very easily (all within reason of course)\n\nMy question is ...how do I let the hiring manager know that I'll need some time off here and there for wedding prep and then probably 2 weeks off in December for my honeymoon/vacation? I actually really liked him and he seems like a great guy. During my interview, I stressed that I am very straightforward and he really appreciated that. Do I just straight up say I have a wedding coming up? or just mention that I'll need some time here and there and then the 2 weeks in December?\n\nFyi, I am a 28 year old woman and it's for an engineering position. I tend to keep my marital status to myself until AFTER I get a job.\n\nEDIT: I think I made it seem like I want to take way more time off for wedding prep than I actually am, but really I'm thinking maybe 2-3 work days off between now and the wedding.",

    "text": "Working for a narcissistic sociopath and finally quitting it !! So i had been working for a 65 yr old guy who has practically no clue as to where his business is headed to or what is really happening on most days !\nI am an MBA graduate n i also hold a masters in electronics and communications engineering. I have 5 yrs of experience and i have worked in 3 different countries and this experience is one of a kind . Though i blame myself for having worked at this company . It was my first job in the US after i moved from Ireland and I needed to start somewhere \nI had documented all his actions during my stay and I would love to share some of them here-\n- most days he would come to work almost drunk n speak for hours in a meeting that has nothing to do with anything at work\n- he would throw me  under a bus in every meeting for him not having done his part of the job n try to make up for it by praising me for dumbest of jobs like converting a pdf to a word doc\n- my husband is a scientist and holds a phd in quantum chemistry.. my boss used to ask me if i speak to my husband the same way i talk to my boss and he used to ask me if i yell at him to help me around the house which was really weird as it was a personal question and someone who is professionally doing well n managed to be independent knows pretty well how to manage himself without a wife yelling at him. Besides , not every house needs yelling around!\n- I sit  in a cubicle thats right outside my boss’s room and if he wants a meeting he would just scream my name out n expect me to “summon”  n he would have a meeting about the logo colors and the font size for 2 hours where is practically talking at me .\n- when he actually wants an opinion n when i started to talk most times he would sit n sleep right infront of me n yawn at my face \n- he once wanted a survey to be sent out to see what the clients felt about a conference, so the fact is surveys don’t really get a good response on a friday as much as any other day.. he said he has his questions ready n the list of candidates he wants to send them out to ready and he kept me waiting till 5 pm on a Friday evening n was clear that he doesn’t want me to go home until i sent it out. I was submissive enough and i kept waiting n waiting n finally i sent it out n i sent an email informing him that i did what he asked and left for the day. He called me twice n texted me twice and again sent an email on a Saturday (which is my weekend ) only to ask if i sent out the survey.. it was extremely weird and made no sense as to why u would ask so many times when i have clearly sent him an email.\n- i was once summoned for a meeting and in his office he has a huge screen thats on the wall  used for all the team meetings and he was on his Facebook account on his big screen chatting with a woman as much as I didn’t want to look at the screen my eyes traveled n i saw that he was chatting to schedule a time to sleep with her .. it killed the living life out of me n made me wonder what on earth am i doing here \n- he summoned me in for another meeting to show me the doddle he drew of an another colleague who he hates as he is dating his ex wife n explained me how he declared bankruptcy twice in the court while settling his divorce.. this meeting was a solid 3 hours story that has nothing to do with work or anything at this point I gave up inside and i hated my job officially and it was beyond my tolerance levels \n- I could have explained the HR but turns out he n my HR have a “ history “ and she pretty much is always on his side no matter what so I didn’t really see the point \nAll these points are just the tip of an iceberg theres an entire book I could write aboutthis guy...\nAs much i hated it .. i didn’t have the guts to quit as i felt extremely insecure about how to find a new job n what to explain people when i quit this job . The close friends and family i have always said why do you care , take your pay cheque and forget the rest , my parents said how does it matter keep a low profile n pretend n pull it till you get the next job.\nSomewhere i had a feeling of disgust and filled with anger and i was just not ready to take it anymore. I dont know if its the right thing i did or not but i walked out of this hell hole just 2 days ago and left a resignation letter without any explanation or a closure..\n\nWhat would your move be in such a situation ????",

I started in early May. I work on the electrical planning for commercial building remodels. The design part, I enjoy, as it's the problem solving and math and stuff that I was wired for (pun intended).\n\nThe stuff I can't seem to do is the project management. I'm pretty bad at figuring out how long a project will take, and I seem to be slow at it. Also I have a lot of social anxiety around making phone calls, in fact I'm making this post right now to procrastinate a phone call. I agonize over writing emails, it can take me over half an hour to write 3 sentences because I worry-edit-worry-edit a million times. I put off phone calls and talking to people til it gets me in trouble. And I am very noticably nervous when I finally do talk to the building management/other engineer/architect/whoever. It doesn't help that I'm a young woman who has no experience in the field. I just don't understand the secret communicating clearly to get the info I need, or even to find out WHO I even am supposed to ask. What do?",

    "text": "Work nemesis fired for incompetence after trying to smear my reputation I need to share this cosmic revenge christmas miracle with you guys. \n\nI'm a software engineer, I was hired a month after my colleague called D.  I am the only woman.\n\nD, despite being older than me, has actually no experience in the field. He was an IT administrator who decided to apply as developer and managed to bullshit his way in. \n\nThe lead developer of my company saw through his act very quickly but our boss took D under his wing. \n\nAs a result I ended up having to take over his workload unofficially to be able to meet the deadlines while he was doing tutorials for fun, not following the specifications for the software development, ignoring the tasks he actually had when they were too hard, coming late and leaving early while taking 2hrs lunch breaks.  \n\nI had actually offered him to teach him a couple of things but it bruised his ego and he was confident of his skills.\n\nIn a weird way, D started to grow resentful of me seeing that I was taking over all the projects even if he was actually avoiding his tasks. \n\nHe started spreading rumours about me. \n\nHe went to several colleagues to tell them that I was not working 40hrs a week and always left early and also said I was the office bitch, that I was too emtional and crazy etc...  \n\nHe also started intercepting communications by talking informally with managers to be the one to give me second handed information which was very annoying. Why would managers go to him first instead of informing me directly while I am in charge of the whole project?\n\nAt the same time he was telling me constantly about the supposed promotions he got (like 3 times in a year) to justify personal meetings he had with the boss in the last months (we were sharing an office)\n\nIt was really demoralizing, I was tired of having to fit 80hrs worth of work in 40 and felt very underappreciated. How could this guy who has not written a line of code in 8 months can be getting promotions while people would ask me if it was true that I was leaving work early.\n\nAnyway...yesterday he got fired. \n\nTurns out that when D started his smear campaign, he had done it in front it of the lead developer that he thought on his side.\nThe lead dev was not amused with the sheninegans of D and we actually have a good work relationship. \n\nHe then started writing down incidents about D  and started reporting them to the boss who took D under his wing which had as an effect for the boss to lose his pink-glasses about D.\nAll those \"promotion\" meetings were in fact warnings to D who tried to demoralize me to push me to quit before he'd get kicked out.\n\nMerry Christmas to me, I guess.\n\nEDIT: oh wow I didn't expect it to be so popular. And thanks for the Gold. I'm happy to spread some joy and Christmas magic upon you all, my sweeties 💕\n\nEDIT2: I would love to respond to more people but Reddit doesn't load the newest comments for the last 8hrs. I get the notification but when I click, the comment doesn't show. I hope it will be fixed, i would love to talk more!",

    "text": "I am a hijabi girl living in italy and today i feel so alone I was born in Italy and for 23 years this is the only reality that I lived in. Sometimes i hear mans shouting at me \"go back to you country!\" But the truth is that this is my only country. My parents moved here when they were 19 years old, they are now in their 60s. They lived a very little amount of time in the middle East compared to what they lived here and i really love Italy, i love the art, the culture, the language. I feel like an Italian but im not being seen as one. I wear a hijab and that automatically make me a foreigner, someone to fear, someone who doesn't speak Italian or, way worse, a woman that have no rights to speak up for herself and has no opinion. \nThey see me as an empty can, a submissive woman that can be mocked. \nI'm a lot of things: a feminist, an engineer, an introvert, an Italian. They see me as... Nothing. \nThis make me feel so bad and alone. I feel that everything I do, they will see it as something \"a Muslim girl do\". If i make a mistake they think \"look how Muslim behave\" and this made me develop a fear for every action I take. Sometimes i feel like I need freedom, the freedom to do anything without thinking that other people will think bad of Muslims because of me. I feel a giant weight on my shoulders and I just want to be...me. \nAn hour ago i was walking with my fiancé, we were having a good time. The weather was good, we had lunch out and did a walk in a park i like a lot.\nWhile I was going back home i was crossing the road. A bus stopped to let me pass and i thanked him. He opened the window and start yelling at me \"you are just a f---ng Muslim. Clear the road or I'll kill you!\" Then he started to swear and began to call me \"sl-t, w--e\" and such.\nThere were a lot of people but no one said anything, instead a group of boys started to laugh and yelled to the bus driver that he was the best. \nI felt so alone. I'm home now, but i fell like i don't want to get out anymore. I feel like i have no country that i can call home, no people that will stand for me, nothing, no one. \nThis isn't the first time something like this happen to me, but this time it hit me hard. \nIm an Italian just like many others, the only difference is the scarf i choose to wear.\nBut that scarf...people can't see the girl behind the scarf and that hurts so much.\n\nI just wanted to share this story to tell that sometimes it's not the hijab that make a Muslim girl oppressed. Its the people who can't understand her choice and make her feel like she is nothing but a scarf.\n\nEdit: hello! Ive read all the comments and i thank you all for the support and for stating your opinions! I didn't thought this will have so many comments, i will try to answer to all of you!\nI want to make some points clear:\n- I didn't intend in any way to insult italians.\n- I know that taking off the hijab is a solution but this will not solve the problem. I can take it off but other muslim women will be harassed. \n- I reported the bus driver. It came out that he is very famous among his colleagues for his behaviour and it's not only racist toward muslim but toward other italians too. \n- Im really grateful to the people who shared their experiences under my thread and really grateful to people who stated a different opinion in a gentle way.\n- I reported at least 23 PM of people who wish me to die or told me to leave Europe because this is not my place. I hope that this doesn't happen with woman/mans who shares their stories on this sub. My story wasn't so terrific but on this sub we have rape survivors and such and i hope they doesn't get this treatment in their PM.",

Some history is that I have a BS in Biology from an engineering school. I wanted to be a scientist when I was younger but turns out I didn't like being in a lab all by myself for hours on end. For the longest time I was told to be a Nurse by family, friends, advisers, and anyone under the sun. I moved to another state where I worked as a lab tech for a year and a gymnastics coach for the last 3 years. I finally got into a program that's known for being the best in the state.  I went through the first semester with no problems. Tests were relatively simple but the whole \"Choose the best answer\" is ridiculous. Clinicals were weird because we only went in for 2 days and I just kind of took up space. The most meaningful thing I did was make sure that a woman (who the nurses sedated heavily before discharge, according to my instructor) didn't fall out of her chair. Not a bad first semester, maybe I can do this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis semester rolls around and I'm awaiting my inevitable heart attack. Before the semester even started I had to basically fight for a clinical time that I could go to and still work my job. We just had our skills check off and I failed. According to the person grading me I did everything well and by the book, but was too slow. Coupled that with stage fright and anxiety from an event from an hour before, I was a neurotic mess. I've been revamping my study style but between that, studying 20 different drugs for a single exam, clinicals approaching, and overall my own mental fortitude, I'm not sure if I can make it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI constantly think about how I'm going to be a good nurse if I can't put a catheter in within a reasonable time? or if I don't remember the drug interaction between something like procainamide, I could kill someone. If I can't do these things, and do well in school, how will I be a nurse practitioner? If I fail my check offs again, I fail the course. If I break sterile technique too many times, I fail. Take too long, I fail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI normally don't give into despair like this but the last week has pretty much broken my spirit. Honestly the only times I feel happy is when I'm home or at work coaching. If I can't cut it in school, how will I make it in the professional field?",

    "text": "Rural Africa medical outreach, motorcycle sidecar for patients? TLDR: Need help designing a side car for patient transport using a 150cc motorbike\n\nHi all-\n\nA friend told me to bring this issue to Reddit. Happy to be here (he also advised me to write the TLDR). I work for a carnivore conservation organization on the border of a national park here in Tanzania. We do a lot of mitigation activities and try to show local villagers that there are benefits to sharing their land with wildlife. Many of them have hyenas and lions eat their livestock and elephants eating their crops. So our organization has a variety of activities all aiming at reducing conflict and showing people that we are one of the many benefits that come from having wildlife.\n\nWe live in an area with many pastoralists in isolated areas. They are mostly uneducated and entirely dependent on their livestock. However, when they are very sick or facing pregnancy complications they do see the value of modern medicine. One of the things we do is help transport patients that are facing life threatening conditions. Last year we did about 130 and many of them occur in the middle of the night. For a variety of reasons we're looking to switch from having our research team drive a car, to having someone in the local villages drive a motorcycle with a side car. It will not only help to create employment for one person but also reduce our workload.\n\nNow, we have several off brand 150cc SE Asian motorcycles. They are rugged and can carry heavy loads, though obviously they are not designed for that. Our idea is to make a side car whereby a pregnant woman could comfortably sit/lay. See below for a design from another country which are too expensive to import.\n\nI am afraid to design something that falls apart and kills someone as I don't know anything about engineering or structural design. I initially thought of adapting a [bijaji](https://cambridgedevelopment.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/bajaji.jpg) (also known as tuktuk) but not sure if it's too large. It might be easier to start from scratch. Labor and common materials are very cheap here and we do have three mechanics on site and a shielded metal arc welding machine (STICK welding) with access to gas welding machines in town.\n\nI'd love some engineering advice with just some general sketches or rules of thumb for us to consider when designing it.

    "text": "I feel so lost (marrying a teacher) I'm marrying the love of my life in less than a month! I am a 28 yo man who works in engineering, she's a 25 yo woman who teaches 6th grade English. She's been teaching for a few years now in a few different positions at various schools.\n\nI understand how tough it is to start a career. I myself had times when I was working 70 hours a week. And I understand there are elements of teaching that I will never be able to relate too. But her career is putting a huge strain on her mental, and now physical, health. It's starting to even affect me and our relationship negatively.\n\nShe's always questioning if she really enjoys teaching. She insists she doesn't care about the students most of the time, even says she hates them sometimes. She works twice as many hours as I do and gets paid less than half of what I make. The stress has gotten so bad that she has developed severe muscle tension. A doctor prescribed her muscle relaxers and pain killers. So now when she's not grading papers at home, she's passed out from the meds. Her health is not where it should be, and her family tree is filled with cancer, heart disease, diabetes, etc. so it is ESPECIALLY important that she maintains a healthy lifestyle and mental clarity.\n\nI do all the cooking, all the cleaning in our house, I drive us wherever we need to go. And I work 40+ hours a week and have a 2 hour commute every day. I'm starting to feel like our relationship is one-sided.\n\nI was hoping she would get wise advice about work/life balance from more experienced teachers she works with. But when she talks about that with them, all they say is \"My husband doesn't like how much I work either. Men are so clingy\" thus further cementing the idea that work/life balance simply isn't possible as a teacher. My fiance has even said \"This is the life of a teacher. If you don't like it, don't marry me.\n\nI think her defensiveness comes from knowing she can't contribute to our relationship as much as I can right now. I know she loves me, and I know I love her. I have no doubts about marrying her. But the lifestyle we have right now is simply not sustainable, *especially* in a marriage and *especially* when we have kids someday. And if we're struggling with work/life balance *before* we're married I can't imagine it improving after.\n\nAt the moment, she is currently a long-term sub. So my suggestion to her is to simply be a daily sub (which she would be able to do as often as she'd like since we have very big districts around us) after her contract is up. She likes that idea too, but she wouldn't want to do that for too long. My fear is that she has become so distant from her true self that she might not be able to come back to her real self. She is so different than who I know she really is right now. It's like she's a totally different person.\n\nSorry for the long post. I just feel so lost and I don't know where to turn to. I feel so rejected by her, although I know she does not intent to make me feel that way. And I'm so scared for her health. She is ALWAYS having some sort of physical ailment that can be related to stress.\n\nTL;DR\nMy fiance's teaching career is taking over her life and damaging our relationship. I've been as supportive as anyone possibly can imo, but now it's damaging her mental and physical health (and her family tree already has tons of horrible mental and physical health problems). I feel like her entire life exists to support her students, and now I'm starting to feel like my entire life exists to support her students too.",

I also need to propose the titles I'll progress through as I go from Graphic Designer to Creative Director. Links to resources appreciated.\n\nI work as a graphic designer for a medical software company that is about 400 people worldwide. Design is happening ad hoc in a couple different groups: Medical Documentation, which has it's own website; Engineering, which has a UI designer for the downloadable version of our software, and who is our resident UX person; Human Resources has a part time GD also; an Outreach team that works with non-profits in developing countries; and the online version of our software has a woman managing the online UI/UX. And little ol' me in Marketing, which isn't ad hoc, and operates with pretty strict brand guidelines. I was hired as an GD intern, and took over the whole shebang when the last Graphic Designer left six months ago. Since it's just me I have a decent budget to use for agency work.\n\nThe problem is there is no coordination between these groups, or the rest of the company's needs for that matter. Our fiscal year is aligned with the calendar year, so I mentioned to my boss that I'd be happy to propose a vision for Design in the coming year, and was subsequently invited to present to all the execs a comprehensive vision for aligning all existing projects, and looking for ways to bring design thinking into other parts of the company. Yikes.\n\nThe other part of it is that I need to suggest a stepped path for advancing through titles if my proposal works out. Don't tell me that I'm acting as the director already and should be titled as such. The company has been great to me, but it would be a political disaster to skip me ahead that quickly; there are people that have been here years longer that won't become directors this year. My boss is willing to continue to keep me on an accelerated path though, I just need to ask for something that isn't too outrageous.\n\nThis is for a $1.5B company located on the East Coast of the US, in one of the tech corridors. If all of this sounds a little outrageous, welcome to Tech.",

    "text": "Is my desired salary reasonable? And how do I get it? Hi guys, this is the first time a potential job has had a negotiable salary rather than a set rate, and I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nIt's a job that's for a small business that does custom upholstery for pretty much anything. Cars, airplanes, benches at resorts. If it needs to be padded and covered in fabric, they do it. They handle both walk-in single orders (Some dude walks in and wants his boat seats upholstered) and commercial contracts (the nearby international airport wants several airplane cockpit seats upholstered)\n\nMy potential boss isnt much of a business man. The times I've met him I've gotten the very strong impression that he leaves a good deal of running the business to the woman I am replacing (she is quitting to be a stay at home mom). He basically sources new potential customers and does the estimates and that's about it. So in addition to the job description as assistant shop foreman/office admin, I would also be doing a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff, and he asked me if I would be willing to also complete a side project.\n\nMy duties in the job description:\n-Sourcing product\n-Taking orders from customers and helping them select the kind of padding/fabric they need, and helping them set a materials allowance if they dont already have one\n-Keeping track of new orders, orders that have estimated, order estimates that have been accepted, whether or not an order's deposit has been paid, if an order has been completed, if a finished order has been paid for\n-Keeping track of bills\n-Keeping memberships with fabric warehouses up to date\n-Sending/creating invoices\n-Creating work orders\n\nSome additional duties added on by the fact owner does not actually involve himself with the business:\n-Making sure workers clock in/out\n-Making sure workers are actually on task while clocked in\n-Creating a work schedule for the workers\n-Organizing bolts of fabric and batting and padding\n-Checking newly shipped fabric for quality control\n-Coming up with ways to streamline production \n-Creating more efficient ways to track finances and work orders as business has more than doubled in the past few months and the current system cant handle the increase\n-Coming up with ways to increase profit (most likely increasing the added % to cost of goods, his current % added is much lower than other companies)\n\nThe side project requested:\nBoss man said he has been consistently under estimating the amount of labor hours his jobs take to complete. He does not know why. He wants me to figure out what's going on and fix it.\nIt could be that he is underestimating the complexity of the jobs, it could be that his workers are slacking.\nEither way, he basically needs me to magically turn into a time engineer and then based on my findings, help him create more realistic estimates, OR turn the shop into a crack down and horsewhip the workers out of slacking off depending on which is found to be necessary.\n\nNow on to my question. He said he will be calling me within the next 24 hours. He said I have the job if I want it, but we need to negotiate salary. He is an incredibly kind man (even with no head for business) but also strikes me as....not cheap but a bargain shopper. He seems like the kind of guy to buy good stuff (not GREAT but not terrible) and haggle for it which is great for keeping costs low but I feel he will try to get the most work out of me for the least possible (not maliciously...just...bargain shopping) I have a feeling his idea of compensation and my idea of it are going to be incredibly different. I want to ask for somewhere in the range of $20-$23 an hour, with $17 being the absolute LEAST I would consider taking, and only then with an agreement to renegotiate after 6 months. But I have a feeling he's more thinking 10-12 an hour.\n\nIs my desired range realistic? And if so, how do I get it without offending him? I feel I would really enjoy this job, I dont want to alienate him or ask for something so high he just drops me, but I also want to be fairly compensated\n\nThank you for any help",

    "text": "How do I out-maneuver a bad situation/horrible boss? I work in the tech industry for an otherwise wonderful company and with great coworkers. There is a boss (we'll call her C) who has been on a war path for a while now. She absolutely cannot take constructive criticism, responsibility for her actions/inactions, nor questions of any kind if they come from a man. (For reference, I'm a woman too.)\n\nC is best friends with the HR rep and uses her as her own personal lackey to fire people for purely personal reasons. (We're in an at will state.) C can't work well with people from other cultures and our company is diverse. She is poisoning the well and destroying morale not just on her own team, but on ours as well. She stifles any attempt of her engineers to learn new skills and hinders them from working with us in the way that we all need and want.\n\nI fear that C's actions, and those of her lackey are going to get the company sued. I cannot say anything due to HR's inability to be impartial. Is there any other recourse that I have? I can't prove discrimination because I think that she isn't aware of her cognitive bias and doesn't make an outright display of her hostility until she gets to the firing table.\n\nIf she continues to fire our best engineers with impunity, I fear that if we don't get sued our projects will fail and eventually I will be laid off as a result of her terrible management. C actually got a promotion last year by claiming an engineer's work as her own. She tried to stop him from even doing the project but conceded when we all agreed it was beneficial. She then fired him so that the source wouldn't be revealed to upper management, but we all know it happened.\n\nC also tends to fire people she puts in leadership roles because they don't meet expectations that she never laid out for them in the first place. They were all great performers though. Sometimes she fires on the basis that an engineer wasn't collaborating with others, when the rest of us work with them just fine. She's the only one who sees it, and I believe many times it stems from her lack of cultural sensitivity. I know that turnover shouldn't be this high in my field and at a company so many of us love.

I was given the opportunity to apply to this Fortune 500 company through a recruiter, who then invited me to a Woman's Superday they were having. I passed and was given an offer. \n\nA few months later, the company asked me and everyone else in my program to fill out a skills and interests survey so that they can match us up with teams. I was put on a team whose technology I had never used nor indicated an interest in. That is fine, and I am learning a lot. However, in a conversation I had with my manager's manager a few months into the job, he told me that I was picked for my team because I was a woman and they had not had one on their team before.\n\nFinally, yesterday I was at a town hall and there was a question and answer session at the end. At the end, the speaker asked if no women had any questions, because I guess he wanted a question from a woman!\n\nI am getting kind of frustrated at the feeling of only being wanted for my gender. I don't feel \"imposter syndrome\" - I am getting along great with my team and putting out good work for my experience. I think I am just annoyed with the amount of attention being placed on something I can't change. I wish I was invited to apply based on my developing ability, placed on my team because of my skillset and interests, asked for input because they wanted MY input, not a woman's.\n\nDoes anyone relate to what I am saying or am I just complaining to complain? I don't really know how to deal with this. Thanks for reading.\n\nEdit: I am super shocked at the amount of replies and conversations this post has sparked.

    "text": "Can we add a bootcamp thread stickied at the top? I have been in the business for 20 years. We frequently get people coming on here asking about bootcamps. We have people who have had success. I remember one woman who after two years experience said she got a high paying job at Amazon in New York. We have others who can't get jobs. \n\nSince there are so many posts on this they don't get many good answers because who wants to repeat the same things? I think one posted thread at the top would be really helpful. However, mods, unfortunately you going to have to go through it and delete posts that do not add to the conversation or the thread will get just too big to find anything. It would also be useful if when someone gives a positive/negative boot camp review you can add it to the first post in the thread and link to the post. This would be REALLY helpful to people. \n\nI am hesitant to recommend them because they are expensive and you can't work. The kind of person this appeals to likely does not have a lot of money. I do not know how to tell a really good bootcamp from a bad one. I think you can do some used car salesmen skepticism. Such as do they give you the HARD SELL. Do they not shut up. Do they go on and on about how much money you will make. Do they then not keep any records of job placement. Do they talk about 'financial aid' in a hard sell when financial aid is just loans or its one of those Persian rug stores where you get a \"sholarship\" since the full price is not really the price. \n\nThe woman who got a job at Amazon said she had to pass a test and show some competence before starting. So they can give you something to study at first. \n\nSo people can name good and bad boot camps. This opens up to shitty ones just putting up fake posts, so we need to say 'take this with a grain of salt'. What to look for when screening. \n\nI also think we can stress just how much work it is. You are basically trying to get prepared to work in a few months where a CS student has 4 years. Now that student is not ONLY taking programming, but they are getting more fundamentals and its more time to digest the knowledge. This tells me that the successful boot camp people don't just show up during the day for class. They work at it EVERY NIGHT. They work on it on weekends. They have side projects. They read technical forums(I find these really useful). They google other documentation and practice at it. They take notes. I think most people are not Mark Zuckerberg. I am 100% self taught. It was a FUCK TON OF WORK over many years to get good.\n\nIf we can get a thread at the top for bootcamps/career switchers people can go through posts. I think this needs to be strongly moderated and unrelated posts should be deleted or else it will just get too long. I am not a fan of mass moderation, but something like this is important to help people out.\n\nTo those who want to do bootcamps: I honestly don't know how to pick a good one from a bad one. I don't know the success rate. All I can tell you is to use these strategies. \n\n1. Google them. If there are tons of web pages talking about how awesome it is, its like fake news posts. MLM companies do this to bury bad reviews. Look on glassdoor and ripoff report\n\n2. If they NAG YOU to buy their product in a hard sell. Its bullshit. \n\n3. If they talk over and over again about how much money you will make, its bullshit. If they are selling their product they need to sell its a lot of work and you can do it if you work at it.\n\n4. If they sell you on lots of jobs then do not keep data on job placement and salaries, its bullshit. Even if they do some of it is bullshit. GOOGLE THEM. \n\n5. Do they make you pass a test to start? Is it a real test? About 20 years ago Chubb Institute had one of these bootcamps with 'scholarships'. I had to pass a test to get in. I spent 3 hours on it. None of it was coding. The 'advisor' (sales person asshole) spent 5 minutes grading and said ok you pass, but not well enough to get a scholarship, you have to pay $30,000. I had to buy their laptop and not use my own (which is cheaper). When I told him it was too expensive, he got mad at me and pointed at the door. It was clear he was on commission. Have a MAJOR bullshit detector. This was 20 years ago so take into account inflation. \n\n6. When in doubt post the name of the boot camp on here and other websites and see if anyone did it. Take the answers with a grain of salt. If its too positive, there is a good chance its someone who works for the company. \n\n7. Do they stress how much work it will be? You need to work outside of regular class hours and on weekends. You need to keep working at it AFTER YOU GRADUATE. You need to do leetcode. Its ALOT OF WORK. No one will hire you just for showing up. \n\n8. I also recommend people post about the company and the website and syllabus on here and other sites. Note there are a lot of CS snobs on here who will tell you its garbage, but you could get some useful answers on whether its garbage or not. For CS people I got a masters in Software Engineering after getting a job and I have read most of the CS books in the undergrad CS curriculum. It is good material, but there are snobs on here. \n\nI think a thread like this is something we can do to help the community. People who are looking to job transition and may buy these classes do not make a lot of money and will not be able to work. I think a big thread at the top with tips and names of good/bad bootcamps will be really helpful to people.",

Either way, I have been sick of it and I voice my opinion about how I think his approach to doing something is wrong for whatever following reasons.\n\nHe is now trying to sabotage my work in indirect ways. He makes comments on my code that are extremely non-productive and nit picky and intended to stall me. He tries to claim ownership over the projects that I have expressed a lot of interest in, and tried to delegate certain parts to me as if he is the authority over me.\n\nThe thing is, he is not even that great at programming. We are almost at the same level and he is not the team’s tech lead. I am resentful that he keeps trying to exert power over me. At the same time I think he is resentful that I don’t “respect” him the way he wants to be respected. Yeah if I’m being honest, I don’t. He’s honestly not super great at programming and I view him more as a peer.\n\nI tried talking to my manager and he basically didn’t help at all. He implied maybe I am imagining it and misattributing things. At this point, I am sick of it. I don’t even want to come to work anymore. I want to quit but if it were not for the cultural problems on my team, this team is my dream job.

Throwaway here for obvious reasons — most of my coworkers use Reddit.\n\nI’m 27 and a female engineer in a male dominated org. I’ve been working 4 years out of undergrad, so not really a whole lot of years in the industry. \n\nMy director is a woman but I don’t know how much perceived legitimacy she actually has. Everyone likes her because she’s friendly and nice but everyone also knows she has zero say in the technical decisions, and is more the “people side of things” than anything technical. She leads the “women in engineering” group for our org. \n\nThe problem I’m running into is that she expects me to be a more active proponent of her diversity efforts. I’m one of the more senior women in the org (the rest are mostly entry level) and she wants me to be more visible and active about being a woman and helping other women and posting in the org diversity groups and overall be more of an advocate for women. \n\nHowever, if I’m being completely honest, the main reason i don’t want to do this is because: 1) this takes time and focus away from me doing actual technical work that would get me promoted, 2) I get the overwhelming sense that people who mention diversity get taken a lot less seriously in the workplace afterwards (at the very least, technically). \n\nAnd so I’m not sure what to do from this position. I don’t believe I am obligated to do what she wants me to do just because I’m a woman too, but on the other hand she sits in on my promotion reviews and I think it really does bother her that I am not as active as she thinks I should be. \n\nThis might be the wrong subreddit to post it in, but wanted to get an opinion for what the best thing politically to do here is.

    "text": "I feel like a diversity quota hire for my internship I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I haven't been able to get it off of my mind ever since I got my intern offer. If there are any minorities who've gone through these feelings, I'd love to hear how you dealt with them.\n\nA few weeks ago, a FAANG recruiter reached out to me for my resume, and then got me signed up for an on-campus interview. I figured that they got my contact information from my applications from the past two years, and assumed that the reason they reached out first was because I was a woman. My suspicion was confirmed when I saw that 90% of the people at the day 1 interview were women.\n\nThe whiteboard questions were fairly straightforward, and I'm honestly really proud of how I did on the second day interview (you had to pass day 1 to get to day 2). I illustrated my thought process out very well, and my interviewer had to ask almost no leading questions for me to get to the optimal solution. That being said, I feel like the questions were almost.....a bit easy for a FAANG interview, not to mention that there were only two interviews total (I got asked about four questions).\n\nObviously, I'm delighted that I got the offer, and I do think I'm a very capable programmer who'll do fine there. Still, I don't feel that I've deserved it at all, knowing that this interview was literally set up as a diversity initiative, and that the interviews I had might have been slightly easier (and shorter) than what normal people might have had to go through.\n\nWhat's worse is my attitude about it with the people who found out. Everybody has been really happy for me (both the men and women) saying I deserve it, but I keep shoving it off as \"I did do well on the interview but honestly I wouldn't have any sort of offer if I weren't a girl\".....which is really doing a disservice to all of the women engineers out there. This isn't the first time I've pushed off something as \"it's because I'm a woman lol\" (namely my internship from last summer), but this time, I really can't be proud because I know that I got an interview soley because I'm a woman.\n\nI guess I might be acting spoiled about the whole situation, and should just accept my lucky situation instead of complaining about \"but did I deserve it???\" since at the end of the day, it doesn't change the situation much. Still, if there's any advice anybody has as to how to process these feelings, I'm all ears.  \n\n\nEdit: Thanks for all of the supportive comments! I think a few contributing factors were probably that a week before, I had a couple of technical challenges that were much more difficult than what I was expecting, and I just barely passed one of them (got rejected right away by the other). Because of that, I assumed \"Ah, all big tech companies must give interview questions that are this hard\", not realizing that sometimes, you end up a bit lucky without an intentional \"we're giving this job to you because you're a minority\".   \n\n\nIn addition (and this is probably the biggest factor that I didn't realize at all), a lot of the CS kids at my college do this very annoying thing where they judge your worth as a person with wherever you're interning. A lot of them assume every person who gets hired at a big-N is either a genius or had connections, and that nothing could possibly be wrong with your life if you have a good SF internship. I hate having expectations on me, and I don't want people to have an inflated impression of me because of a lucky opportunity I happened to get (this is a reaction a friend of mine already had). I've begun to realize that I should just ignore all of that bullshit, and enjoy myself without worrying about what these people think.",

    "text": "What to do next? Woman software developer  Hello guys, I would love to hear your opinion...\n\nI am a woman, and I got a Python developer job 9 months ago. My friend (now the boss and one of the owners of the company), asked me if I would like to join. I had half a year of professional programming experience in Python and bachelor degree in Informatics. I looked into the online application for the job. I asked for the lower salary range listed (since I was 'inexperienced.') I was asked to go even lower for now. I agreed and hoped it would change soon. Well, it didn't even though I worked 9-12 hours per day to learn as much as possible.\n\nMy boss is sitting next to me all the time (a few other programmers are sitting 'against' us), he is also going with me to lunch every day (and also correcting me all the time even because of bullshit I started to talk about just to fill up the silence sometimes). I was so unmotivated that after 4 months I told him I am not able to be productive & programming 8 hours straight per day so at least I can go home after 7 hours now. But they considered it as a salary raise. Just noting that I also finished my engineer diploma in the meantime.\n\nFor a few next months, I felt motivated again, but now it's back to the usual. I'm annoyed by sitting next to my boss who is staring into my screen very often, getting a low salary, going to the office every day (home office is possible, but I would have to ask each time...).\n\nI get paid 13k USD per year after taxes (living in eastern Europe). Although this is slightly more than a school teacher in my country, all my friends (male-developers) are getting much more. I would be comfortable with the double and work my way into the triple of it. I wouldn't mind working 12 per day if it's appropriately paid and I would have some privacy.\n\nI decided to leave this job in several months (when my 1-year contract is expiring). I would love to be more independent, I was thinking to get a remote job in a coworking space and sometimes work at home. I started to look for that kind of job, but honestly, I don’t know 14 different technologies usually listed there and I don’t have 5 years experience as a senior developer as they are asking… Nobody cares that I can learn anything but I have to actually use it regularly to be confident with it… Dear guys, was someone in a similar position?

But now that I'm here, I feel like I may not be cut out for it. I am still an upcoming senior in undergrad so I shouldn't be comparing myself to my project managers or even fellow coworkers (who are full-time employees). But, sometimes they'll be (very nicely) explaining concepts to me and I'm just sitting there thinking that I will never be able to be so organically knowledgeable about Software Dev. I guess it's a mix of Imposter Syndrome (even though I studied for an entire month, day and night, for the internship's interviews) because I just don't feel nearly as competent to have an entire company or even my teammates relying on me for anything! I only just got into programming about a year ago so this is all very new but at the same time I feel like I bit off more than I can chew. I also sometimes convince myself that I only got this internship because I was a good-looking young Hispanic woman, not even so much for my talents. Which only brings me down more. \n\nMy dream in life is to be a software engineer for one of the top tech companies but I feel like I'm barely even bright enough to have gotten this internship.

    "text": "How do I explain this to an employer? Career advice? I worked as a programmer for a sum total of 25 months. In that time I went through four programming jobs, was fired from three, and resigned after a month on the fourth. After the fourth job I decided that I would rather live with my parents and try to get a job as a waiter than try and find a fifth programming job. That being said I am having an issue explaining this to people either on my resume or when people ask. For example today at a server interview the woman asked \"why don't you do programming anymore?\" I basically said that I can't program anymore and I'm living with my parents and just need to cover health insurance and basic expenses.\n\nOn my resume there is now a two year segment that says \"Various computer programming jobs\" and a bullet point that says \"No longer doing programming jobs because I am not able to code anymore.\" Technically that's a lie - I can physically write out lines of code, I just can't do it at work without a more senior engineer telling me what file to modify because I can't learn a codebase regardless of how much time I spend on it. I got by for 20 months at Amazon Web Services by constantly asking for help and redirecting tasks (and on-call alarms) at more senior engineers before my manager told me that I would have to go on a \"performance improvement plan\" (at which point we mutually agreed that it was time for me to go). I just wanted to check and make sure that this little lie is better than putting a bullet point on my resume that says \"No longer doing programming jobs because: I hate it, I suck at it, and I don’t need that much money\". Is it better to be honest about that or continue telling that little lie?\n\np.s. My Reddit username is \"JohnReedForPresident\" because I had bipolar mania and decided to run for President online after I was fired from my third programming job for being crazy. I am happily taking psychiatric medication and living with my parents who can step in if I am ever crazy again.\n\np.p.s. I got an Adderall prescription which might help me with the whole \"can't learn problem\" (I'm not stupid - I scored a 1540/1600 on the SAT and got hired by AWS - I just have brain problems). I think ADD might have something to do with it because at stand ups I hear my teammates talking but don't pick up anything that they are saying. I don't know if Adderall will help but my parents are pressuring me to get back into programming instead of giving up on it and working as a waiter. I don't know if the Adderall will fix \"can't learn shit on the job\" but to be honest I don't know if I want to go back to programming even if I could or if anyone would be stupid enough to hire me.",

Natural gas, my job is to not make things go boom by doing some very precise work for gas processing plants.\n\nThis detail is only important because I want to emphasize that this kind of job is hard to find in this area of expertise and that's why it one of a kind and fun and interesting and so on...\n\nThe problem is, corruption, and it is not a joke when they say it is spreading like wildfire.   \n\nBeing an European and working in an EU office, in an American company, top management is obviously American but all bellow the hierarchy are locals and that is a big problem here, I will explain why.\n\nNepotism or hiring an acquaintance is very common and their are very open about this with no shame and no consequences and it seems no one cares as long as results are being produced. My direct manager is a woman my age with less experience in this field which found herself in a position of managing a team, basically overnight, only because she is the sister in-law of the operations manager. She is out of her league in every way, clueless and not even trying to understand anything...everyone around her is just a tool to build her resume and even if anyone says something or does something to point out a mistake she has the full backing of upper management.\n\nI am really at a loss for this, I don't know what to do. She is careful in making any mistake just because she avoids a straight answer, even the emails are carefully written in the sense that everything is a \"suggestion\" or you need to consult this, read that, talk to this person... the decision falls only on the person who she is relaying a half-order. In case it is executed well she takes credit but in case it is not the other person does.\n\nWe're about 20 engineers and 4 of them just quit, could not deal with the bullshit anymore. While others they became indifferent to the work, which is also affecting everyone because it was nice to speak with someone that had the same enthusiasm about problem solving and engineering work as you did. Now they just cant be bothered, it's just a do the work \"yes sir\" or \"consider it done\" attitude with minimum effort and I cant blame them.\n\nDue to circumstances about my living conditions, living in this town with my wife I truly have nowhere else to go unless I switch roles, but a new role would mean a start from 0 and all of years would be for nothing because my applied skills are no match in any other industry of engineering (well, like 90%).\n\nI refuse to believe that I'm powerless in this situation, what can I do? Has anyone dealt with this before before the \"\\*\\*\\* this shit I'm out\" attitude kicked in ?\n\nWonderful job, amazing projects, I feel like I'm making the world greener by learning about implemented new techs in these old polluting factories... I really dont want to call it quits.\n\nLooking forward to any kind of reply.",

There's almost a certainty that either you or your grandmother have called me something terrible over the phone. My only experience is in customer service, and I'm dying inside.\n\nOur offices work at a national capacity, which means we're relatively specialized and there isn't exactly room to break out. There are a few exceptions, but these are highly competitive and awarded to people with backgrounds I can't compete with. I recently sat with somebody who got a ITT Tech degree in some kind of engineering/design field. This wasn't much of an aspiration, but more of a fond memory, something she could hardly recall. It came up when we were looking at an outage map which contains HFC Plant symbols and she was vaguely able to identify them. To be frank, she was one of the dumbest people I've come across in the position. She would ask questions that practically answered themselves, and more than once. I remember this was during the last presidential election, because I recall her saying she would vote for Hillary because she wants a female president, but then pausing and saying \"we haven't had a female president yet, have we?\" Anyway, she couldn't figure out how to set up a Set-Top Box, but here looking at this map, she was dropping random HFC terminology to demonstrate she had, at least at one time, had them in her vocabulary. She absolutely wasn't cutting it answering phones at a billing capacity, but when the next HFC Designer position opened up, she got it.\n\nAt some point in her life, I'm willing to bet money that this woman has paused for 2+ minutes at a McDonalds drive thru before asking if a double quarter pounder weighs two quarters of a pound. And we all watched her pack her things and move into an office of her own, where her pay probably doubled. Most people aren't petty bitches, so they moved on with their lives. But I found this very inspiring. Please note, I have no experience in the field and mean absolutely no disrespect to the profession. I just found inspiration in the fact that this person got the position. Maybe I could.\n\nI used a free trial for Lynda.com and watched the full Up and Running courses for AutoCAD and Bentley Microstation. It looks very straightforward, and I've quickly taken to many other programs like Illustrator, InDesign, Flash, PhotoShop, etc. After 10 hours of tutorial videos, I have a reasonable idea of what it looks like, and I'm conversational in how HFC Networks work.\n\nAfter all that, what I came here to ask is: \n\nWould it be a waste of time to pursue an entry level HFC Designer position with no actual background or education in the field? I'm technically inclined, conversational in the content, and have a desperate need to break out of customer service. Is it crazy to expect that I can fill in the gaps with on the job training?\n\nI'm not in a position where I can get a degree. My most productive hours are at work between calls.

I'm pretty new to software development, 3 years out of college where I didn't major in anything computers. This is my first job with the title 'Software Engineer', which is what I want to do. I have only been at my job for about 8 months and the hiring process involves a lot of training that makes it an investment in my career on my employers part. I'm really good at my job. Because I didn't have any Software Engineering titles on my resume, I came in at entry level which I was fine with and the HR rules make it really difficult to get raises and/or promotions. \n\nThere used to be another software engineer, who showed me the ropes before he quit for greener pastures. Everyone worshiped him. They just started searching for a replacement for him. I have been doing the entire development job for two months now and quite enjoy the responsibility and control I get over my work. \n\nHere's where the problem comes in. The position description for the new developer describes my job, quite rightly, as they would be taking half my work. Since the dude who left was worshiped, my manager is replacing him with a 'more experienced' developer. At 3 years of experience, same as I have. Except the new guy would come in at a much higher pay rate, being a non-entry level position. I asked if I could take that job (happens all the time at my company, instead of promotions/raises, they create a new higher paying job for you, weird, I know). My manager told me that I was not qualified for the job (I am definitely qualified), but I am welcome to apply. I don't want to give up my new-found responsibility to be supervised by someone who isn't better than me at programming. I also don't think my self-esteem can handle training someone who gets paid more than I do when I am the one with experience at this particular job and they have no more programming background than I do.\n\nMy manager hasn't been a developer in 20 years, does not know what I do, and does not see any of the results. I haven't been around long enough to gain a reputation of being great at my job, although I really am. My manager underestimates me a lot, or at least is uncomfortable talking tech with me (I am a woman, the only one in my department). \n\nIt seems to me like a great time to jump ship and find a higher paying job where people respect me. However, I feel bad leaving the company so soon, especially since they won't have an developer for months while they interview, hire, and onboard a new person. They did invest a lot of money in me and my resume got a giant boost from all the training they put me through. They found out that I am interviewing with a few other jobs and they did offer me a slight raise, although this is after - not before - they found out that I am planning on leaving. Every other job I am interviewing for pays considerably more than the slight raise they offered even, and I expect offer(s) to come in soon. \n\nIs this the right choice to go somewhere else? I feel incredibly guilty at leaving them without a developer after they did so much for me. Should I stick it out and wait until after they find a new person and I can train them, knowing that it could be months? How much do I owe the company?

That is: say yes to everything you possibly can and provide reasonable expectations for what it will take. Everything is possible but not everything is profitable. Finally, I've learned that on the other side of being passionate about something, is being self-disciplined.\n\nSelf discipline is the difference between a coding statesman and a script kiddie.

I have only gotten a working solution for 1, but for that screen I received feedback that I was too slow, needed too much guidance, and didn’t reach an optimal solution. So I’ve never made it to an on-site.\n\nI majored in computer science in college. I have also been powering through leetcode for 4 months, and have done mock interviews because I’ve heard that the hiring process for the Bay resorts to these type of questions to pass the interview. So I do have a decent amount of experience with coding and solving DS/algo questions, both by myself and in a “real” interview situation, but I’m still having trouble with medium questions. Is it normal to feel like this even after 4 months of studying?\n\nI’ve never done this kind of studying for jobs before. I was very lucky in college and didn’t have to do this kind of interview prep at all. For my current job, I was asked to do a simple online coding test, and for the phone screen I was only asked a very simple array manipulation question. It was nothing near the level of questions that companies are asking me now. I feel pretty defeated, and I feel like these last 4 months of consistent studying has been a waste.\n\nIt’s not only my failure rate for coding that I’m concerned about though. In my experience from working at my current company, I’ve found that I am much slower than the rest of my coworkers- I am constantly overwhelmed by meetings where other engineers design and plan out solutions on the spot, and find that I have a very hard time keeping up with them. I feel like I am lacking in general knowledge that I should have, too- When other engineers are asked about design/code clarifications, they are oftentimes able to answer smoothly and with confidence. But I struggle to answer back coherently when asked, and too often I feel like I have to embarrassingly reply to people that I don’t know the answer to their question. And I am not just comparing myself to senior/mid level engineers; I feel like I am lagging behind the new grads who were hired at the same time as me as well.\n\nAnother note also... I’m a female. And I have many tech friends who work in the Bay who constantly tell me that it’ll be easy for me to get a job there since companies there actively try to hire more women. I don’t know how true this is, but if it’s true, these rejections just make me think that if I can’t pass these interviews even as a woman, then I really must be incompetent...\n\nAm I cut out for this field? If not, what are some alternative job titles I can look into that utilize my computer science degree? I’d appreciate honesty, I’m not looking for words of encouragement (unless they are sincere/constructive).",

    "text": "Is it normal for an assessment test to require a third party organization manage your webcam??? Test got terminated for no reason Im a new recent graduate in CS and I've been earnestly trying to find a job and I finally landed in a place where I can start doing the interview process. The first step is a assessment. I dont know what this employer does with this assessment because they said I will start training super soon. Its an entry level software dev position and they are doing training etc. BTW my recruiter STRAIGHT GARBAGE. I emailed him countless times to get more info never a single response like WTF? But i digress. First part that I've never done for an assessment is for the webcam to be accessed by a third party company. Welp f it i need this job. During the test it told me image violation meaning my face some how wasnt in frame. Im like \"Wtf my face is right here\" so i put a book under my laptop on my lap so its level with my face. While taking it my laptop began to slide off my leg and i accidentally touched the mouse pad of my laptop. My cursor was at the top of the browser and click......... I get a window violation and my test is terminated. This is not only frustrating asf but i have anxiety taking these sort of test. Also im a new grad where tf you learn about j2ee. Where do we learn to use enterprise software??? I've used different frameworks and code things from scratch. J2ee wasnt event apart of the job description. \n\nThe company I just applied as I recently learned today is a very discriminatory place. The place laid off all 30+ new hires that were african american. Dont believe?? find the review and i have friends who went to this place. They graduated in may did the whole training and did good got hired on and after a few weeks all african american employees fired for no reason. A lot of them know their ish so wtf?? In new york its the same type reviews. I may have strayed a bullet idk. \n\nTLDR: Why are some recruiters so bad? I cant get a single response at all from the one who recruited me. I messaged on linkedin and via my gmail. Did all of you have to do the same webcam thing? I dont like it one bit :/ . What is an effective course for j2ee since this assessment was based on that? Are all entry level software engineer test like this?\n\n\nFOR THOSE WHO DONT BELEIEVE HERE IS A REVIEW About this company. If your in my state you probably seen it if you researched the company.   ->\n\n \"This is the worst dicriminative place to work. Turns out their management team is the worst deceiving lying manipulative (Chonia Ballard, Karthic) unprofessional clueless individuals who know nothing about  insurance claims. They would train new hires to process 40 claims a day for commercial and government payors. What stood out to me the most was how they house their native Indians on one side and my black folks on the other side like a slave plantation. I witness Chonia mistreat and displace several of her own black people for this Indian guy (Karthic). Then turn around and laid off all 30 new hires who were all black African American aside from the Mexican and Caucasian woman who quit the second week of training.\"",

    "text": "How do you ladies respond when someone calls you out on your hair? If this belongs in /r/blackhair, let me know. I thought it made more sense in this subreddit because I'm asking black women how they respond/react to people asking about their hair.\n\nBackstory: \n\nI've been natural for 5 years and my hair is very very very thick. A couple weeks ago I went snowboarding on my spring break trip. Beforehand, I decided to invest in my first wig so I didn't have to deal with my natural hair and I could fit it inside a snowboard helmet. I'm not very good at hair/make-up and I dont live in an area with a lot of black people so there arent any hairdressers around that could help me. I'm also halfway across the country from my family that could help me with wigs so I bought a wig off Amazon and had to consult YouTube. My first attempt at doing a full frontal was trash and I ended up wearing a headband the whole trip to hide the shitty lacefront. After the trip, I didnt use my wig at all and have been wearing my natural hair as a fro or wash n go. Also a note - I'm an engineering grad student working at an internship for 30 hours week and I run a sitting business so I pretty much have zero time to spend on myself right now.\n\nI'm graduating this June and realized I need to do something with my hair to fit it in the cap so I busted out the wig this week to practice getting better at it. Even though it's looking better, I am still hella self conscious about it. I dont feel entirely comfortable and I'm anxious that it's obvious it is a wig and that I look dumb af.\n\nToday a lady I work with called me out in front of everyone and said \"traderjoesheaux, how did you get your hair to do that?\" And everyone stared at me. I felt so uncomfortable and on the spot so i just laughed and said \"it's a lot of work\" and then kept going about my business. Then she came up to me again a few hours later and said \"so, are you going to tell me how you did your hair?\" I was anxious and I instinctively lied and just said \"extensions.\" She responded \"oh, I thought it was a wig\" and now I feel incredibly embarrassed. Is this just me? How do you politely respond to someone that keeps prodding about your hair? We're both engineers on a small team so I work closely with her and I didnt want to be rude but in my mind I just wanted to say \"it's none of your fucking business.\" At the same time, shes a middle aged Indian woman and one time we were making small talk before a meeting and I explained to her my braid out routine. Does being transparent about my hair previously mean I shouldn't be annoyed when people ask questions later? I don't think she meant to offend me, I think she was genuinely curious. But even so, if I brushed it off the first time, why would she feel she deserved an explanation?\n\nMaybe I'm just overthinking this but it really triggered me and I've been feeling so embarrassed for some reason ever since and I dont know why. How do you ladies navigate the situation or are you just honest about it being a wig?",

    "text": "A compilation of evidence debunking feminist historical revisionism. I have made a post somewhat similar to this before but I've since collected a lot more information about these topics and so I believe warrants yet another post.\n\n*Myth #1: Women weren't allowed to work.*\n\nMost documentation from the past heavily implies that people attempted to avoid working as much as possible. Even so, many women did work (mostly because they had no choice but to) and there has never been a law restricting women from working.\n\n\"Though creative research has produced evidence of women working at male-dominated occupations in the eighteenth century and before, there is undoubtedly more documentation out there, in newspapers, diaries, legal proceedings, and prints. What is more compelling is the lack of documentation that women were not allowed to work. Although religious practices and social norms might have restricted certain activities in some parts of the world, there were no laws prohibiting women from working a trade.\"\n\nAt the time, only members of a trade guild (associations of producers that trained craft people, maintained control over production, regulated competition and prices) were allowed to sell their goods or practice their skill within the city. Non-guild members were prohibited from selling competitive products. An aspiring master would have to pass through the career chain from apprentice to journeyman before they could be elected to become a master tradesman. They would then have to produce a sum of money and a masterpiece before they could actually join the guild. If the masterpiece was not accepted by the masters, they were not allowed to join the guild, possibly remaining a journeyman for the rest of their life.\n\nWomen were not barred from any of the trade guilds in Britain at least as far back as the 1400s. Apprentice forms for guildwork had spaces left blank to insert 'he' or 'she', though girls who chose this traditional route to mastery of a trade (which was extremely long and arduous) were usually orphaned and had low prospects for marriage, thus they were going to need to work.\n\nMarried women, though, had the privilege of circumventing the long, onerous, arduous process of trade certification as they could receive the master tradesman status from their husbands and thereby continue his work, even take on apprentices to train (which suggests that the social assumption was that wives would learn enough about their husband's business and trade to be able to at least continue to oversee it after he died). Lots of widows continued to run their husbands' businesses long after their death.\n\nThe Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths in London lists sixty-five \"brethren\" and two \"sistren\" in its 1434 charter.\n\nA 1770 publication called *The Tradesman's True Guide or a Universal Directory for the Towns of Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Walsal, Dudley and the manufacturing village in the neighborhood of Birmingham* carried exhaustive lists of tradesmen and tradeswomen alphabetically by name and by trade, and there are women listed in every trade from butcher to wire drawer.\n\n[https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring04/women.cfm](https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring04/women.cfm)\n\nReally, very little I've seen shows that women were maliciously \"kept out\" from trades or professions that they wanted to enter into. It may have been a social norm that most women did not seek out careers as they do now, but looking at the histories of the first women to enter into medicine, law, etc, show that they hardly faced any resistance in doing so.\n\nIn 1847, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman to attend medical school in the US and was the first woman on the Medical Register of the General Medical Council. She sent applications for admission to twelve of the most promising institutions in the northern states, and her application was accepted by the medical department of Geneva University. Feminist revisionist history \"explains\" that she was only admitted to the college by the evil men as a joke, but as will be amply demonstrated this is the opposite of what actually happened.\n\nIn fact, the student body sent her a letter to welcome her:\n\n>At a meeting of the entire medical class of Geneva Medical College, held this day, October 20, 1847, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:–  \n>  \n>Resolved – That one of the radical principles of a Republican Government is the universal education of both sexes; that to every branch of scientific education the door should be open equally to all; that the application of Elizabeth Blackwell to become a member of our class meets our entire approbation; and in extending our unanimous invitation we pledge ourselves that no conduct of ours shall cause her to regret her attendance at this institution.  \n>  \n>2. Resolved – That a copy of these proceedings be signed by the chairman and transmitted to Elizabeth Blackwell.\n\nShe describes this letter as one of her most valued possessions, and in her autobiography she states that the men of the college supported her 100% and beyond.\n\n\"The behaviour of the medical class during the two years that I was with them was admirable. It was that of true Christian gentlemen. I learned later that some of them had been inclined to think my application for admission a hoax, perpetrated at their expense by a rival college. But when the *bona-fide* student actually appeared they gave her a manly welcome, and fulfilled to the letter the promise contained in their invitation.\"\n\nShe also notes that the general public also had a favourable view of a woman entering into medicine.\n\n\"The admission of a woman for the first time to a complete medical education and full equality in the privileges and the responsibilities of the profession produced a widespread effect in America. The public press very generally recorded the event, and expressed a favourable opinion of it. Even in Europe some notice of it was taken, and 'Punch' showed his cordial appreciation by his amusing but friendly verses.\"\n\n[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/blackwell/pioneer/pioneer.html?fbclid=IwAR09FZZlnVMVha0PNLYnQQDSnptVDEoGxokEf10QHPCGgxZMly5HyfDlgQI#III](http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/blackwell/pioneer/pioneer.html?fbclid=IwAR09FZZlnVMVha0PNLYnQQDSnptVDEoGxokEf10QHPCGgxZMly5HyfDlgQI#III)\n\nThere are also other examples of women entering into \"male\" fields and encountering little resistance. There's the example of Arabella Mansfield, the first female lawyer in the United States. Although by Iowa law the bar exam was restricted to \"males over 21,\" Arabella Mansfield took the exam in 1869, passing it with high scores. Mansfield challenged the state law excluding her, and the Court ruled that women may not be denied the right to practice law in Iowa, admitting Mansfield to the bar.\n\nOr Ada Lovelace, who was encouraged in her mathematical ability from a young age by her parents and received the best of tutors to increase her ability. She worked with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Machine, though they both \"fell into historical obscurity, and the Analytical Engine was unknown to builders of electro-mechanical and electronic computing machines in the 1930s and 1940s when they began their work, resulting in the need to re-invent many of the architectural innovations Babbage had proposed.\"\n\nOr Amelia Earhart, who was flown \"like a sack of potatoes\" by pilot Wilmer Stultz across the Atlantic in her 1928 transatlantic flight, and immediately became a celebrity, wrote a book about the experience, was used to endorse products, and dubbed 'Lady Lindy'. There is a plaque that marks where the plane landed in Wales. All the fervour over it was solely because she was a woman who crossed the Atlantic regardless of the fact that she didn't do any flying at all in her 1928 flight (She did, however, go on to complete a transatlantic solo flight later on in 1932).\n\n[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia\\_Earhart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Earhart)\n\nOr, for a very long-ago example of this, Murasaki Shikibu from Japan around the year 1000, who listened at the door while her brother received lessons in Chinese writing and through that learned it herself. She was far from reviled for being a woman who knew Chinese and was commissioned by the Empress to write the Tale of Genji, a classic work of Japanese literature often called the world's first novel.\n\nOh, the o p p r e s s i o n .\n\n*Myth #2: Marriage was an institution created by men to oppress women. Men were disproportionately given privilege and power and women were treated like his property in marriage.*\n\nAgain this is a bastardisation of the past. Feminism has to stop treating men as the enemy and as the source of all women's (and also men's) problems. They need to realise that things weren't always as they are now, and realise that it was not Patriarchy or men that restricted the choices of both genders and forced them into strictly defined roles, but that these roles came about because it was the best way of arranging societies in the past - a past that was much harsher and more unforgiving than it is now. A past in which there was more work to do than there were hours in a day. A past where men spent most of their short lives working like mules to support themselves and their families and women spent most of their short lives incapacitated by childbirth and child-rearing. A past in which we sent children into coal mines that ruined their lungs and into factories which lost them limbs. Things sucked, and the reason it was bearable at all back then was *because* of the gender roles.\n\nMen were not the ones who relegated women to the domestic sphere or kept them dependent on men. Biology did. A woman at that time could not simply strike out on her own and do whatever she wanted. For most of history we had no reliable birth control, no safe abortion, no maternity leave, or social security, and most public sphere work back then involved hard labour. And if you were a woman back then who wanted to be able to have sex, then you would have had to plan your life around the idea that you would be getting pregnant, giving birth, and breastfeeding for most of your adult life - and that would have meant you could not be a reliable enough worker to support even yourself, let alone a child, and it would inherently have made you dependent on other people to help you. Until the last 100 years or so, most women could not have lived a life of children and public sphere work, independent of a man (and not all can today, realistically).\n\nEven with support, most women in poor and middle class families had to work because that was the only way to make enough money to live.\n\nSo in a time when single motherhood was a one-way trip to the gutter, marriage was a practical arrangement. The function of marriage was not to oppress women, but to positively assign paternity inasmuch as possible, and then obligate the men so assigned to their children and the mothers of their children. For life.\n\nThe taboo on sex outside of marriage (which was applied to men no less than women) made it difficult for an unscrupulous man to cheat the system. These rules surrounding marriage also mitigated the problem of paternity uncertainty, which maximised men's willingness to invest in their kids. \"I know these are my kids, so I will work hard to feed and shelter them.\" And the reason why we kept lifelong monogamous marriage for so long is because it increased the resources which would have been available to offspring, providing a healthier environment for children to grow up in.\n\nSo when a man married a woman, he was legally obligated to feed, clothe and shelter her and any children produced in the marriage to the best of his ability. Unlike what feminists seem to think, he could not sell her. He could not return her for his money back. He could not drop her at the local midden heap. He could not destroy her the way he could his actual chattels. He could not trade her for a better one. He could not legally neglect her.\n\nJust to make things crystal clear, here is a summary list of entitlements that women enjoyed in marriage (and after marriage) during the old \"patriarchal\" system of the past.\n\n1. When a woman married, she had to hand over her property to her husband's care (again, NOT because she herself was property, but because he was administrator of the family), but he OWED her not just a living, but the best living he was financially capable of providing for her. A wife was entitled to be maintained by her husband.\n2. Though women did not have the right to enter into contracts in their own name in marriage, women had the privilege of the Law of Agency, giving them the legal right to purchase goods on their husbands' credit as their agent. If the wife racked up debts that the husband couldn't pay, she was immune from liability for the debts she racked up - that liability fell to the husband instead.\n3. Women had the entitlement of being protected from prosecution for any number of crimes if they could prove their husbands were aware of said crimes. In which case, he would be prosecuted in her stead--not just held AS responsible as she was, but held solely responsible for her actions. This allowed married women to displace accountability for a large number of offences onto their husbands. \"She's out of control and does what she wants, regardless of my wishes,\" was not a valid legal defence for those men.\n4. Women were exempt from paying taxes, and there was an entire female underground economy of barter and trade that was not subject to taxation or government interference. Even when married women gained the right to hold property within marriage, it was their husbands who were responsible for the taxes owing on it, and it was their husbands who were held 100% financially liable for providing all necessaries to the family, including the wife, even if she made more money than he did.\n5. After divorce, men were held fully financially responsible under the law for the ex-wife and kids. Divorced women were entitled to be supported by their ex-husbands to a level commensurate with the husband's for potentially the rest of their lives unless she remarried.\n\n[https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download\\_file?file\\_format=application/pdf&safe\\_filename=Item.pdf&type\\_of\\_work=Journal%20article](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download_file?file_format=application/pdf&safe_filename=Item.pdf&type_of_work=Journal%20article)\n\nThat doesn't sound at all like women were treated like property to me.\n\nI'm sorry, but if I have property, I have no legal duty of care toward the actual property I own, nor any obligation to commit to own it until death. I can smash my property on the ground and treat it however I want and it would be my right to do so. Men could not do any of that to the women they were married to. They had obligations towards them to provide for them - even after divorce, and to protect them - even from the consequences of their own actions. Wives had no such obligation towards their husbands - they were entitled to be the ones who were supported. Because the purpose of marriage in the past was not to oppress women and make them the property of men, but to ensure that women and their children could be provided for and protected, and to place the responsibility for that provision and protection on the man even at cost to his own wellbeing, health, and even life. This has been the case since time immemorial.\n\n\"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.\"\n\nEphesians 5.\n\n[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A22-33&version=NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A22-33&version=NIV)\n\nIn fact, many of the supposed \"privileges\" men had in marriage in the past were to help them carry out their obligations and to prevent them from becoming wholly onerous.\n\nIf a man had an obligation to be accountable for provision for his wife and children and to maintain family finances, it stood to reason that he also should have the entitlement of having control over any assets of his marriage, including those his wife brought into the marriage, because he was the one who had a responsibility to keep the entire family afloat and to increase their holdings.\n\nIf a man was responsible for the protection of his wife and children to the point where he could be legally required to stand between his wife and the law within numerous contexts, and be punished in her stead (whether she contracted debts he couldn't pay or committed a crime he would have to answer for), it makes sense why he would be considered head of household and why his family would need to obey him as well as abide by the restrictions he placed on them.\n\nIf, upon divorce, a man would be held solely responsible for the maintenance of his wife and child, it makes sense why he would get custody of the child that he was supporting, as well as ownership of assets so he could satisfy that obligation.\n\nWe gave men these rights and privileges because they were the tools that he needed to satisfy his responsibilities. And in that way there was a balance. \"Women \"got less\" because their obligations and accountability were less, their responsibility was less. Men \"got more\" because the buck stopped with them, whether that buck consisted of a sack of coins or his blood.\"\n\n*Myth #3: Men were allowed to beat their wives with impunity.*\n\nIn the past men were allowed to use \"mild correction\" on their wives under the law (as he was socially and legally responsible for the actions of his wife to the extent that he could even be held accountable for the crimes and offences she committed), but he could not beat her black and blue. Men had restrictions on what corporal punishment they could use on their wives.\n\nIn Colonial America, when men went beyond what was legally acceptable, they received punishment through the pillory. “The pillory was employed for treason, sedition, arson, blasphemy, witchcraft, perjury, wife beating, cheating, forgery, coin clipping, dice cogging, slandering, conjuring, fortune-telling, and drunkenness, among other offences. On several occasions, onlookers pelted the pilloried prisoner so enthusiastically with heavy missiles that death resulted.”\n\n[https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring03/branks.cfm](https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring03/branks.cfm)\n\nThe whipping post also was a favourite form of punishment for wife-beating. Many examples of vigilante justice, sometimes lethal, enacted against wifebeaters can be found in newspaper clippings from the 1800s and onward, with the full endorsement of society.\n\n[https://unapologeticallyantifeminist.video.blog/2019/05/21/correcting-notions-about-domestic-violence-in-history/](https://unapologeticallyantifeminist.video.blog/2019/05/21/correcting-notions-about-domestic-violence-in-history/)\n\nWe can assume that this was practiced in Europe as well. Likewise, Americans practiced shivaree and Europeans practiced charivari as a way to enable social censure of wife-beaters. Charivari was a historical folk custom expressing public disapproval of personal behaviour, where a mock parade was staged through a community accompanied by a discordant mock serenade. Sometimes the crowd would carry an effigy of the targeted man to a substitute punishment, e.g. burning. Sometimes the man who physically abused his wife would be abused by the community.\n\nThey would chant:\n\n*Old Abram Higback has been paying his good woman; But he neither paid her for what or for why, But he up with his fist and blacked her eye.*\n\n*Now all ye old women, and old women kind, Get together, and be in a mind; Collar him, and take him to the shit-house, And shove him over head.*\n\n*Now if that does not mend his manners, The skin of his arse must go to the tanners; And if that does not mend his manners, Take him and hang him on a nail in Hell.*\n\n*And if the nail happens to crack, Down with your flaps, and at him piss.*\n\nHowever, if a husband was beaten by his wife - the husband, in contrast, was also the subject of the charivari for essentially allowing it to happen. In France about 1400, husbands beaten by their wives were “paraded on an ass, face to tail.”  In England, a [mural in Montacute House](https://montacutehouse.blogspot.com/2012/04/skimmington-ride.html) (constructed about 1598) shows a wife beating her husband with a shoe and then a crowd parading the husband on a [cowlstaff](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cowlstaff). \n\nSamuel Pepys recorded in his diary, 10 June 1667: “in the afternoon took boat and down to Greenwich, where I find the stairs full of people, there being a great riding there to-day for a man, the constable of the town, whose wife beat him.”\n\nA Frenchman who traveled in England reported in 1698: \"I have sometimes met in the streets of London a woman carrying a figure of straw representing a man, crown’d with very ample horns, preceded by a drum, and followed by a mob, making a most grating noise with tongs, grid-irons, frying-pans, and sauce-pans. I asked what was the meaning of all this; they told me that a woman had given her husband a sound beating, for accusing her of making him a cuckold, and that upon such occasions some kind neighbour of the poor innocent injur’d creature generally performed this ceremony.\"\n\n[https://www.purplemotes.net/2013/01/27/charivari-sex-inequality/](https://www.purplemotes.net/2013/01/27/charivari-sex-inequality/)\n\nHmmm. So while a man could give his wife mild correction under the law, if he went too far with wife-beating the community would frown down upon him and punish him with the pillory, whippings and charivari. THERE WAS NO SUCH EXTREME SOCIAL OR LEGAL CENSURE FOR A WIFE WHO BEAT HER HUSBAND. IF SHE BEAT HIM, HE WAS THE ONE WHO WAS PUNISHED.\n\n*Myth #4: Husbands were owed sex with their wives. Marital rape was not illegal, and marriage as an institution was based around rape of women.*\n\nThe idea at the time was that there could not be such a thing as marital rape because as a married person you are owed sex from your spouse, i.e. conjugal rights. This applied to both men and women. People who believe that conjugal rights \"allowed husbands to rape wives\" and not the other way around haven't actually done any research.\n\nIt was based on the idea that **both parties** had a right to sex in the relationship, and this was exercisable in law by each partner in a marriage.\n\nThe Bible said:\n\n\"*It is* good for a man not to touch a woman. **2** Nevertheless, because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. **3** Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband. **4** The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband *does.* And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife *does.* **5** Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.\"\n\n[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7&version=NKJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7&version=NKJV)\n\nDo note the specific passage where it says \"The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband *does.* And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife *does.\"*\n\nAnd here's a quote from an article detailing the history of sex and marriage.\n\n\"A hundred years ago or so, if you took the statute books literally, the only people entitled to have sex with each other were people who were legally married. All other sex was against the law. Fornication (sex with unmarried people) was illegal; so was adultery (sex with a married person—but not the person you yourself were married to). Cohabitation—living with someone in a sexual relationship—was against the law, except for people who were legally married. Enforcement was, shall we say, something less than perfect. At times, it was almost nonexistent. And the rules were riddled with exceptions. Sodomy, on the other hand, was quite a serious crime; and the full weight of the law sometimes came down heavily on people who had gay or lesbian sex.\"\n\n\"Married people were not only *entitled* to have sex; they were, in a way, *required* to have sex. Of course, nobody checked on whether John and Mary were having sex every night, or once a week, or once a month, or never. But if either John or Mary did not perform at all, for whatever reason, the frustrated partner had grounds for divorce; or even perhaps an annulment.\n\n[https://verdict.justia.com/2017/01/24/sex-necessary-legally-speaking](https://verdict.justia.com/2017/01/24/sex-necessary-legally-speaking)\n\nHusbands faced divorce if they were impotent and unable to consummate the marriage, though charges were usually made years after the wedding day. There was a similar charge of frigidity for wives, but it seems that wives charging their husbands for impotency was far more common. Husbands had to show an erection to a court audience and sometimes attempt to perform sex with their wives as well.\n\n[Source 1](http://www.bu.edu/law/journals-archive/bulr/volume89n5/documents/HOFFMAN.pdf) [Source 2](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/05/18/the-hard-on-on-trial/)\n\nBeing incapable of performing sex for your wife could merit corporal punishment. One medieval husband wrote about his unhappy marriage and his impotence in a book called The Lamentations of Little Matheus.\n\n\"My wife wants it, but I can’t. She petitions for her right. I say no. I just can’t pay.\"\n\n\"Even given his sexual incapacity, Matheolus was subject to corporal punishment:\n\n\"Acting as her own advocate, Petra {Matheolus’s wife} puts forward the law that if a shriveled purse {scrotum} can’t pay because it’s empty, under statute recompense for that injury is corporal punishment.\"\n\n[https://www.purplemotes.net/2015/05/03/matheolus-church-wife/](https://www.purplemotes.net/2015/05/03/matheolus-church-wife/)\n\nSo what does this show? It shows that both parties had an obligation to provide the other partner with sex during the marriage, and could not deprive their spouse of it. If it was an issue, it was not an issue that solely affected women.\n\n*Myth #5: \"Men had the vote and women did not. Women's suffrage was a matter of women as a united group fighting for their rights against the evil men that kept it from them. Suffragettes were champions of equality who got women the vote. Etc, etc.\"*\n\nReally, I'm very tired of hearing this one.\n\nIn Britain, the right to vote was not only restricted by gender, but also by class. Property owners had the vote, the vast majority of men did not. In 1830, just 3% of the population had the right to vote.\n\nDuring this time, there were a few groups who were fighting for the vote to be extended to them, and one of these groups were the Chartists, who were active from 1830 to 1868. They were fighting for broad electoral reforms including:\n\n* a vote for all men (over 21)\n* the secret ballot\n* no property qualification to become an MP\n* payment for MPs\n* electoral districts of equal size\n* annual elections for Parliament.\n\nThey presented three huge demonstrations to Parliament, and their requests were denied every time. The restrictions were relaxed but not abolished. Benjamin Disraeli said when introducing the Second Reform Act of 1867: \"We do not live – and I trust it will never be the fate of this country to live – under a democracy. The propositions which I am going to make tonight certainly have no tendency in that direction.\"\n\nThere were also the suffragists and the suffragettes, who were fighting for the vote to be extended to women. Suffragists emerged in the mid-19th century and believed in peaceful, constitutional campaign methods. In the early 20th century, after the suffragists failed to make significant progress, a new generation of activists emerged. These women became known as the suffragettes, and they were willing to take direct, militant action for the cause.\n\nHowever, a huge amount of women disagreed with women's suffrage. So many women objected to the franchise being imposed on them that in the mere 18 months leading up to a 1910 parliamentary debate on women's suffrage, anti-suffragettes had managed to collect 300,000 signatures from women who objected to the franchise being imposed on them. Meanwhile, in the 16 years leading up to that debate, suffragettes only managed to collect 193,000 signatures of women who wanted the vote.\n\nA segment from the transcript of the debate:\n\n\"Still, for what it is worth, one finds that from 1890–1906 only 193,000 women signed Petitions to this House in favour of female suffrage, and that during the last eighteen months, a period in which a strong anti-suffrage association has been in existence, 300,000 women, some of them eminent women, have signed petitions against it, and to the effect that these proposals shall not be forced upon them.\"\n\nAnd...\n\n\"A rather interesting illustration was furnished by an inquiry which was instituted by \"The Sheffield Independent,\" a newspaper which I think itself is sympathetic with these proposals. This inquiry was addressed to the women householders of Sheffield. Twenty-three thousand papers were sent out, and of the replies 9,000 were in favour of woman suffrage and 14,000 were against it. The representatives of this paper reported that in many cases their emissaries were chased with violence from the houses by the female inhabitants under the impression that they were collecting statistical matter as the emissaries of the suffragist party.\"\n\nIt may be difficult to understand why so many women would reject the vote so vehemently, but this was an era where full citizenship rights like the right to vote were granted only to those with citizenship responsibilities like conscription (and sometimes not even then). In that historical context, the vote was actually viewed not just as a right, but also an obligation. So it was never really about men in power shutting women out of the franchise. It was about government having to decide whether to impose a responsibility on women that women as a whole *clearly did not want.*\n\n[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1910/jul/11/parliamentary-franchise-women-bill](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1910/jul/11/parliamentary-franchise-women-bill)\n\nRegardless of the lack of support for women's suffrage among women, suffragettes became extremely militant in their activism. In 1903 Emmeline Pankhurst founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) with her daughters Christabel and Sylvia, and the WSPU carried out a nationwide bombing and arson campaign. Between 1912 and 1915, hundreds of bombs were left on trains, in theatres, post offices, churches, even outside the Bank of England; while arson attacks on timber yards, railway stations and private houses inflicted an untold amount of damage.\n\n[https://www.historytoday.com/history-matters/sanitising-suffragettes](https://www.historytoday.com/history-matters/sanitising-suffragettes)\n\nInstead of being beneficial in supporting the vote for women, it was disastrous. Lloyd George said: \"The action of the militants is ruinous. The feeling amongst the sympathisers of the cause in the House is one of panic. I am frankly not very hopeful of success if these tactics are persisted in.\"\n\nTerrorism aside, Emmeline Pankhurst was also resistant to acquiring the vote for working class men, realising that this would be much tougher than winning the vote for \"respectable\" AKA upper-class women, and underlying the resistance appears to have been her contempt for working-class men. According to Sean Lang in his book on Parliamentary reform: \"The Pankhursts became stridently anti-male, ruthlessly dropping even the most loyal of their male supporters from the WSPU, and claiming, as Christabel did in her 1913 book *The Great Scourge*, that men were “little more than carriers of venereal disease”.\"\n\n[https://conservativewoman.co.uk/men-won-votes-women-not-suffragettes/](https://conservativewoman.co.uk/men-won-votes-women-not-suffragettes/)\n\nWhen WW1 came around in 1914, suffragettes also threw their support behind the White Feather campaign with the aim of shaming men into enlisting. Those young women went in for the kill, striking men at the very heart of their masculine identities, the bestowing of a feather telling them, \"If you don't go off to be maimed or die, you are no longer a man in the eyes of some brassy chit you've never even met before and will probably never see again.\" And many men went, because a woman's censure - ANY woman's censure - had the power to drive them straight into the teeth of death.\n\nBy mid 1915, it was clear that not enough men were signing up to replace the fatalities on the front line, and the Military Service Act was introduced in January 1916. By March 1916 compulsory conscription for all single men aged 18-41 was in place. In May 1916, the Act was extended to include conscription for married men.\n\n[http://www.eastsussexww1.org.uk/attitudes-towards-conscription/index.html](http://www.eastsussexww1.org.uk/attitudes-towards-conscription/index.html)\n\nIt was only at that point that the British government considered extending the vote to all men, as most of the propertyless, working class men that were conscripted into war during WW1 did not have the right to vote, and this was finally starting to be seen as the injustice that it was. In the trenches class divisions were eroded to the extent that class no longer had any real meaning and every man was the equal of each other in terms of sacrifice and service to one's country.\n\nMen got universal suffrage in 1918 with the Representation of the People Act, which enfranchised more than five million men over the age of 21 without regard to property or class. Women of all classes were piggybacked onto the Act, with an age restriction temporarily in place to prevent women from becoming a supermajority voting bloc, given that about 1 million British men had died in the war. Regardless, this brought more than eight million women over 30 into the electorate. And just ten years later, the 1928 Act (the act which gave women electoral equality) gave the vote to women at age 21, which added another five million women to the electorate.\n\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/has-everyone-forgotten-male-suffrage/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/has-everyone-forgotten-male-suffrage/)\n\nIntroducing the 1918 Bill, the Home Secretary George Cave said: \"War by all classes of our countrymen has brought us nearer together, has opened men's eyes, and removed misunderstandings on all sides. It has made it, I think, impossible that ever again, at all events in the lifetime of the present generation, there should be a revival of the old class feeling which was responsible for so much, and, among other things, for the exclusion for a period, of so many of our population from the class of electors. I think I need say no more to justify this extension of the franchise.\"\n\nThe Act was achieved not by the suffragettes’ terrorist tactics, but by fighting of men in WW1, when thousands of men from their many different backgrounds came together to fight the common enemy. This finally achieved what the Chartists, the Levellers and the peasants before them had struggled for in terms of eroding barriers of class. Without the sacrifice of men who endured the horror of trench warfare in WW1, class barriers would have persisted and at most the vote would have been extended only to elite, wealthy, propertied women.\n\nIn a later study of attitudes to conscription in 1939, one woman responded: \"In the last war \\[(WW1)\\] I never told one man that he ought to go. I tried to put myself in their place. If I’d been them I wouldn’t have gone. When I saw them going through the streets – all the young men – I used to think that they were being driven like cattle to the slaughter house. And they were, weren’t they? Fodder for the guns.\"\n\nThe common idea that all men had the vote, and that women did not, and that women's suffrage was a fight of women who were united against men working as an oppressive force to keep them down is an affront to these men who died in a literal war that secured universal suffrage for everyone (many of which, in fact, did not have the vote). It also ignores and erases the will and sentiment of many, many, *many* anti-suffragette women who actively rejected the vote and protested vehemently against it being imposed on them.\n\nFurthermore, the view that suffragettes were a valiant, fair-minded, equality-oriented group who got women the vote and whose activism merely amounted to firecrackers in barrels is an affront to any right-thinking person. The real violence and extremism of the suffragettes is barely, if at all, recognised by the general public, and this is partly due to attempts by suffragettes to sanitise their history.\n\n\"Laura E. Nym Mayhall, in her work on the militant suffrage movement, identified the importance of \"a small group of former suffragettes\" in the 1920s and 1930s, who created a highly stylised story of the WSPU and the history of suffrage in England, which emphasised \"women’s martyrdom and passivity\". The group set about compiling the documents, memoirs and memorabilia that now form the basis of the Suffragette Fellowship Collection held by the Museum of London.\"\n\n[https://www.historytoday.com/history-matters/sanitising-suffragettes](https://www.historytoday.com/history-matters/sanitising-suffragettes)\n\nAnd here we are now, in crazy world. According to the dominant narrative, all men always had the vote since the dawn of recorded human history, and they refused to give it to women because penis. The demonstrations of the Chartists, and the dead bodies of these men that were sacrificed to the unpopular idea of male suffrage (and who got votes for women in the process), have gone down the memory hole. The terroristic actions of the suffragettes, engaged in for the benefit of wealthy and privileged women only and for which they were barely punished, are the noblest of acts for the noblest of causes. And of course, the only reason anyone could EVER have opposed them was because of misogyny.\n\nedit: wording\n\nedit 2: Added some extracts from [w1g2's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/edyrf5/a_compilation_of_evidence_debunking_feminist/fbtays6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).",

    "text": "One brave young man takes on gender inequality at USC  \n\nMisandry—the hatred of men—has been a staple of my polemical writing  for more than fifteen years. I felt a special obligation to hammer away  at gender myths such as intimate partner violence (women are about [as likely as men](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062022/) to initiate violence against their partners as men), false sexual allegations (a [disturbing percentage](https://medium.com/t/@jimpreston_36730/how-many-rape-accusations-are-false-f52e4c675f2a) of such allegations) and demonstrable [bias against fathers](https://theccf.ca/ideology-and-dysfunction-in-family-law/)  in family court, because male journalists who dared to write  sympathetically about men and/or critically about women put their  careers in jeopardy (no exaggeration), and most had learned to keep *shtumm* in this domain.\n\nThat  situation has been changing slowly but steadily. Some men have decided  they aren’t going to spend their lives in rhetorical purdah on the  subject of their own cultural dhimmitude, and have been stepping up to  the plate, whatever the personal cost. The university campus is home to  the feminist commissariat—and it’s a brave man who dares to stick his  head above that formidable parapet. Because the cost of doing so can be  high.\n\nThis is the story of one such activist who paid a price,  which only fueled his resistance efforts, and which in turn inspired  others, in reversing a decades-long erosion of men’s rights on campus.\n\nIn  a meeting held in June, 2017, Kursat Christoff Pekgoz was pressured by  his academic director at the University of Southern California into  terminating his PhD degree in English Literature on what Pekgoz  considered spurious and unprecedented grounds, accompanied by “many  threats and irrational exaggerations” (the meeting was recorded).  His  contract was not renewed and his funding was cut off. This is extremely  uncommon. In fact, Pekgoz is unaware of any other PhD student being  denied a doctoral degree in English Literature \\[at USC\\].\n\nThe real  reason for his PhD termination, Pekgoz alleges, is his history of gender  activism via a series of Title IX complaints against a number of  universities, such as Rutgers, [Northeastern](http://ncfm.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NCFM-Title-IX-complaint-Northeastern-University.pdf) and Georgetown, to which he added [one against USC](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/ea7b71_0c223159779e4beaaea809873f2504a7.pdf) at the end of May. As he [told a PJ Media reporter](https://pjmedia.com/trending/ph-d-student-files-federal-complaint-says-usc-retaliated-against-his-pro-men-title-ix-activism/), “They all know that I am a Title IX activist for men, with strong libertarian/conservative views.” \n\nTitle  IX’s language is very plain. It prohibits any institution from funding,  sponsoring, or listing gender-discriminatory programs and initiatives,  so for example, even listing a woman-only scholarship or placing an  employment ad specifying only women need apply runs counter to Title IX,  though such breaches happen all the time. Title IX also prohibits  discrimination in terms of counselling or health benefits. That should  mean that both men and women are treated with equal objectivity and  respect when, say, sexual-assault allegations come up for assessment.  But universities have [not covered themselves in glory](https://helpsaveoursons.com/category/fighting-back/), to say the least, on that front. \n\nIndeed,  motivation for Pekgoz’s robust activism arose in part from a Title IX  complaint against him for sexual harassment. In response, he went on  offence with a forceful and persuasive [counter-charge](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/ea7b71_16c1692eab8844218afdb2b419622827.pdf)  that his accuser had in fact sexually assaulted him (it’s worth  reading, because it offers a formidable sample of the kind of meticulous  research and annotation Pekgoz applies to every single thing he says  and writes. It does not seem to leave much wriggle room for his accuser,  and I think any objective reader would come away from it with,  minimally, doubts as to the accuser’s credibility.) \n\nIn 2018  Pekgoz complained to the Department of Education’s Office of Civil  Rights (OCR) about both USC and Yale University, prompting an  investigation into both schools’ women-only scholarships and programs,  such as a USC Women in Science and engineering group that excludes  males.\n\nLast January, Pekgoz and two former lawyers (not affiliated with Harvard University) filed a Title IX [complaint with the OCR against Harvard](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/ea7b71_85533d99ee0748ac813ca937735a4f94.pdf),  in which they rebut the received wisdom of female victimhood with an  abundance of impeccably-sourced evidence demonstrating the various ways  in which men are discriminated against in society and on campus.  Notably, “the overwhelming majority of all persons sanctioned under  Title IX theory are male. However, there is good evidence that men and  women experience sexual victimization at equal rates and the majority of  male victims [report female perpetrators](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1752928X11001569). The majority of Title IX administrators are women.”\n\nAlso in the Harvard complaint is a reference to Supreme Court prohibitions against male-gender discrimination. In [*Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan*,](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mississippi-University-for-Women-v-Hogan)  for example, the Supreme Court held that denying male admission to  nursing courses was impermissible under the Equal Protection Clause of  the Fourteenth Amendment. They wrote that a sex classification must be  “…determined through reasoned analysis rather than through the  mechanical application of traditional, often inaccurate, assumptions  about the proper roles of men and women. … Thus, if the statutory  objective is to exclude or ‘protect’ members of one gender because they  are presumed to suffer from an inherent handicap or to be innately  inferior, the objective itself is illegitimate.” This statement would  seem to undermine the reflexive argument adduced by feminists that  affirmative action for women is still necessary because of historic  disadvantage or because there are more *Fortune 500* male CEOs than women.\n\nThe  most interesting complaint to the OCR, because it reveals the distance  the men’s rights movement has come from its first tentative and atomized  beginnings two decades ago, is the one led by Pekgoz [against Cornell University](https://www.scribd.com/document/399202262/Coalition-Complaint#from_embed) in February, which Pekgoz described in an  [interview with *Campus Reform*](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=11853) as “one of the worst in the nation” for anti-male bias. \n\nThe  document contains a “list of exclusionary programs” at Cornell, such as  the lack of a Men’s Resource Center to balance the women’s Center, or a  Men’s Health Center to balance the Iris Cantor Women’s Health Center.  Likewise – even though “men are twice as likely to have heart attacks  through life than women” – there is a women’s Heart Program, but none  for men.\n\nBut the list itself, while interesting, is not what is  most significant about the Cornell complaint. Rather it is the public  support for the complaint amongst Pekgoz’s colleagues and from many  respected public intellectuals, such as American Enterprise Institute  scholar and feminist critic [Christina Hoff Summers](https://www.aei.org/author/christina-hoff-sommers/),  that lend unusual moral weight to its claims. More than 185 professors,  scholars and activists signed on to it, including Canada’s own Jordan  B. Peterson, arguably the most recognizable and inspirational spokesman  for gender equality in the world today. Peterson referenced Title IX’s  long association with women’s rights succinctly: “what’s sauce for the  goose is sauce for the gander.”\n\nPeter Wood, president of the National Association of Scholars, told *Campus Reform*  that he had signed the complaint because it “addresses a fundamental  unfairness in contemporary America, centred in our colleges and  universities” and because “it shows that exclusionary practices create a  hostile environment” for men, some caused by an “animus against males  perpetrated by feminist ideology.” Lawrence Alexander, a law professor  at the University of San Diego, told *Campus Reform* that he signed because “its allegations are true and even understated.”\n\nSuch  public affirmation on men’s behalf by high-status academics in  prestigious institutions represents something like a tipping point in  the gender wars, it seems to me. Margaret C. Valois, a Virginia-based  Title IX attorney who specializes in defending accused male students  filed a similar Title IX complaint against Tulane University and [obtained a win](http://www.aei.org/publication/successful-title-ix-complaint-forces-tulane-university-to-end-gender-discrimination/)  recently. Valois, Pekgoz and another aggressive veteran in the battle  for gender equality, Professor Mark Perry of the University of  Michigan-Flint, are profiled by anti-feminist Canadian vlogger Janice  Fiamengo, a signatory to the Cornell complaint, in [Episode 94 of her popular Fiamengo File](https://inclip.top/studiobrule/aLDRY3qCkmjIuoI/will-2019-be-the-year-of-mra-lawsuits-tff-episode-94.html) series, titled “Will 2019 Be the Year of MRA Lawsuits?”\n\nWill  it? It does seem that we are at a pivotal moment—that there is a  powerful current of social unease, running just below the still  hegemonically feminist surface, with the unfettered misandry that  pervades our culture. In Pekgoz’s Harvard complaint, for example, he  notes that whenever the Department of education investigates an  institution for anti-male discrimination, public attitudes on the issue  are on the side of men: “\\[A\\]ccording to a recent poll conducted by  YouGov, 69% of all Americans believe that men face discrimination to  some extent. 74% of men believe that such discrimination occurs, while  63% of women agree that men face some degree of discrimination.”\n\nFiamengo points to what she ([and I](http://www.barbarakay.ca/articles/view/1297)) consider radical feminism’s shark-jumping moment, the publication in the *Washington Post* of Northeastern University academic Suzanna Danuta Walters’s odiously misandric June, 2018 article, “[Why can’t we hate men](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-cant-we-hate-men/2018/06/08/f1a3a8e0-6451-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html)?” which earned her a [Title IX complaint](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=11249) filed by the National Coalition for Men [(NCFM).](https://ncfm.org/)  Walters doubtless expected her screed would find the passive acceptance  such anti-male rants often have done in the past, but was clearly  startled by the fierce blowback she received.\n\nA final word about  Kursat Christoff Pekgoz. I don’t know him personally, but from his  history, I would say that the USC Literature department picked the wrong  guy to tangle with when they forced him out of his PhD program. This is  a young man, now 30-something, who comes from Turkey, a land where they  play political hardball, and backing the wrong horse can earn you  something worse than a Twitter mobbing. He learned about activism in  what we might call an “unsafe space.”\n\nPekgoz’s [*curriculum vitae*](https://www.kursatchristoffpekgoz.com/)  informs us that In Turkey Pekgoz went out on potentially dangerous  political limbs. He took part in the Republic protests of 2007 against  fundamentalist Islam, as well as a protest against Islamist hate speech  targeting Armenian and Jewish minorities in 2009, amongst other forays.  He advocated against electoral fraud by the Islamist regime. He taught *pro bono* for an anti-Islamist organization that seeks to eliminate illiteracy among young women in Ankara (real feminism in action). \n\nAll  this speaks to character. For relentless discipline and determination  in achieving goals, add this salient fact: As a long-distance swimmer,  Pekgoz has covered 11,000 m in the open sea, with the best speed of  5,000 m in 130 minutes. This is in seawater with a temperature of 17C.  Don’t look to such a man to truckle to latte-sipping ideologues  trafficking in gender injustice. Ever.\n\nAccording to his bio,  Pekgoz has “perfect pitch.” He means musically, of course. But it may be  the case that he has perfect cultural pitch as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.thepostmillennial.com/one-brave-young-man-takes-on-gender-inequality-at-usc/](https://www.thepostmillennial.com/one-brave-young-man-takes-on-gender-inequality-at-usc/)",

    "text": "Let's discuss how women exert power and influence in society One of the recent dog whistles from feminists is that men can't be discriminated against, because men are the ones who hold power and influence in society, and not women.  While I don't agree with the logic behind this argument, I also don't think it's true that men have most of the power, and that women are strictly powerless.\n\nIn this post I will briefly outline ways that women have power, and how this power has been used to subjugate men in various areas of society.\n\n###**Examples of power and influence held by women**\n* **Women make up 54% of the electorate in the United States** ([source](http://cawp.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/resources/genderdiff.pdf))**, and a majority of the electorate in most democratic nations world-wide**.  The female vote is often seen as the most important cohort of voters.  It is more important than the male vote, the white vote, and the minority vote.\n* **Feminism and women's groups make up the second largest special interest group in the United States (behind the military industrial complex) and are the largest special interest group worldwide, in places like Canada, Japan, and Europe**.  They also hold significant sway in local state and municipal elections.  And let's not forget that the military industrial complex is not friendly to men.\n* **Women hold a significant amount of wealth worldwide, and a majority of the wealth in the United States (by some estimates: 60%)** ([source 1](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/bmo-report-despite-controlling-14-trillion-in-wealth-american-women-still-have-challenges-to-overcome-2015-04-02-13173119), [source 2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2010/07/28/women-making-economic-strides-and-not-slowing-down/)).  To the extent that wealth translates to power, women are the ones who take most of it.  This also means that, baring an aversion to investing in equities, women likely own a majority of all publicly traded companies in the United States.\n* **Women control a majority of spending, exerting even more economic influence through the wallets of their boyfriends and husbands** ([source](https://www.fastcompany.com/1663594/women-dominate-the-global-market-place-here-are-5-keys-to-reaching-them )).  What this means is that most companies cater to women, not to men.  Most luxury cars worldwide are sold to women ([source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-13/luxury-automakers-are-finally-discovering-the-power-of-women-buyers)), most advertising is marketed towards women, and most decisions made by large companies are designed to cater to women.\n* **Women control most relationships and most marriages**.  The so-called \"ball and chain\" is real.  Women make a majority of the decisions for most families ([source](https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle-2-15039/women-decide-to-rule-the-roost-1-1503380)), and when a husband and a wife disagree about something, the wife gets her way the vast majority of the time ([source](https://public.psych.iastate.edu/ccutrona/psych592a/articles/Vogel%202007.pdf)).  Note that this is not because men cede this power to women willingly; women actively take it from men ([source](https://public.psych.iastate.edu/ccutrona/psych592a/articles/Vogel%202007.pdf)) through manipulation, gaslighting, the threat of divorce, and other abusive behaviors.\n* **By default people listen to women more, and women exert more social influence than men**. Gender feminists like to talk about power dynamics between wealthy men and poor women, as if it were a common occurrence in society.  But they ignore that, by default, it is women who have the upper hand and often control men.  Women are more likely to get their way and are more likely to be in charge of social situations than men.\n* **Academia is incredibly sympathetic to women and gender feminism**.  Equity feminists (feminists who believe strictly in equality) have been complaining about this since at least the 1990s ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Stole_Feminism%3F)).  Gender feminism is the primary form of feminism held by academics, and there has been widespread complaints that dissenting views are not tolerated, and that professors with dissenting views are often discriminated against.  Examples of unethical academic behavior and discrimination is published in the academic literatute, and is itself the topic of academic study, even among feminists ([source 1](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-19716-004), [source 2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265747881_Disabusing_the_definition_of_domestic_abuse_How_women_batter_men_and_the_role_of_the_feminist_state), [source 3](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2790940)).\n* **Hollywood is incredibly sympathetic to women and gender feminism**.  Most media representations of men are negative, and masculinity is actively attacked in TV shows and movies ([source](https://archive.is/NHC61)).  Most Hollywood actors pay lip service to gender feminism, and it is likely necessary for them to do so if they want to advance their careers.\n\n###**Examples of how this power and influence has been used**\n* Many of our divorce and child custody laws were championed by stay at home wives who were afraid of being divorced, and women today are slow in wanting to change them (often not even wanting to sign a prenup when they get married).  Being that most women supported these laws, and that women made up a majority of the voting public, it was only natural that these laws were passed.  The amount of money that is transferred from men to women through marriage and divorce is likely on the order of hundreds of billions of dollars a year, if not more.  This represents a significant infringement on male financial and bodily autonomy, and it is women who are primarily responsible for this situation.\n* Men do not have the same rights that women have when it comes to their choice to be a parent.  Women can unilaterally chose whether or not they want to raise a child, and men are forced to go along with that decision.  Men are literally *powerless* here, being completely beholden unto the mother, and are often forced into wage slavery as a result.\n* Men are less likely to receive custody of their children, even when they are the better parent ([source 1](http://www.breakingthescience.org/SJC_GBC_analysis_intro.php), [source 2](https://themalefactor.com/2019/10/03/37-ways-men-are-discriminated-against/)).  This is in large part because of laws that were passed by female voters, and by discrimination and stereotypes that fathers face on a societal level that are often enforced by women.\n* Women have dramatically expanded welfare programs and created an unfair tax situation for men.  Welfare may be politically divisive, but it is factually true that women are more likely to use welfare ([source 1](https://www.creditdonkey.com/welfare-statistics.html), [source 2](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-97.html)), and it is factually true that women have consistently voted to expand welfare benefits to themselves ([source 1](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~iversen/PDFfiles/LottKenny.pdf), [source 2](http://conference.iza.org/conference_files/ELIT2008/bertocchi_g1882.pdf), [source 3](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30026099?seq=1)).  Women on average consume more government resources than what they pay back in taxes, and as a result, it is men who are paying for these programs ([source 1 (USA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/2kj8qu/the_benefits_gap_a_cursory_analysis_of_us_social/), [source 2 (New Nealand)](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cpf/publications/pdfs/WP10_2013_Distribution-Income-and-Fiscal-Incidence_18062013.pdf)).  This represents another form of wealth transfer form men to women.\n* Women have successfully manipulated men over thousands of years to provide them with free labor and money.  As a result, women can work easier jobs that pay less money, and use men to make up the difference.  Societal norms that pressure men to pay for dates, and to be the primary breadwinner in a relationship, are enforced by women and their preferences for dating and marriage.  The wage gap is likely not only caused by women, but is itself an indicator of financial privilege that women have over men.\n* Men are demonized and stereotyped, and these stereotypes are reinforced by TV shows, movies, and flawed academic theories.\n* Feminism itself represents a force of misandry and discrimination against men, and feminist theory is often used to shame men and silence their opinions ([source](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/01/male-feminist-rules-to-follow/)).\n* Men are often nagged, harassed, and bossed around to do things against their will for their wives and girlfriends ([source 1](https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle-2-15039/women-decide-to-rule-the-roost-1-1503380), [source 2](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2008/09/25/women-call-the-shots-at-home-public-mixed-on-gender-roles-in-jobs/), [source 3](https://public.psych.iastate.edu/ccutrona/psych592a/articles/Vogel%202007.pdf)).  Husbands spend more time, energy, and money supporting their families than their wives do.  As a result, women have more free time, and more money to themselves, outside of work, chores, and child care, than men do ([source 1](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/ft_18-05-01_fathersday_time/), [source 2](https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-myth-of-the-lazy-father)).\n* Men's spaces are increasingly disappearing in society, and the existence of concepts like the \"man cave\" proves that women are in charge of most spaces in society, including inside the home ([source](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-decline-of-male-space/)).  Men's spaces are often seen as sexist and old fashioned, whereas women's spaces are seen as normal and hip.  Many women's only spaces directly violate anti-discrimination laws, but are given a free pass ([source](https://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/article/So-far-women-only-gyms-are-allowed-by-the-courts-1133532.php)).\n* Our school systems have been reformed to help girls, and this has created a toxic environment for boys to grow up in ([source](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/05/the-war-against-boys/304659/)).  Gender feminism is primarily responsible for these reforms.\n* Given the same qualifications, women are often paid more than men ([source 1](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/technology/google-gender-pay-gap.html), [source 2](https://inews.co.uk/news/media/bbc-men-pay-rise-gender-514047), [source 3](https://www.outkickthecoverage.com/the-us-womens-soccer-team-is-actually-paid-more-than-the-men/)) and many job openings specifically, and openly, discriminate against men in favor of women ([source 1](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/04/22/396672571/could-it-be-researchers-find-a-hiring-bias-that-favors-women), [source 2](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jun/18/top-engineering-university-to-open-jobs-exclusively-to-women)).  \n* Women have successfully campaigned to remove homeless shelters for men, and create new homeless shelters for women (often in their place) ([source 1](https://patch.com/new-york/flushing-murray-hill/college-point-shelter-opens-week-will-only-house-women), [source 2](https://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/news/2019/04/26/city-county-unveil-plan-to-redevelop-building-near.html)).  This is despite the fact that most of the chronically homeless and unsheltered are men ([source](https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2018-AHAR-Part-1.pdf)).  Conversations about homelessness tend to focus on helping women, instead of helping men ([source 1](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_560bfafde4b0af3706dec4a0), [source 2](https://www.homeless.org.uk/sites/default/files/site-attachments/Homeless%20Link%20-%20analysis%20of%20rough%20sleeping%20statistics%20for%20England%202017.pdf), [source 3](https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_homelessness), [source 4](https://i.imgur.com/v4yuVub.jpg)).\n* There are more domestic violence shelters for women than there are for men, even though men are equally likely to be victims.  This is enforced by flawed stereotypes against men that come largely from academic and societal influences that are wielded by \"radical-feminists\" ([source](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-19716-004)).  Feminists have distorted domestic violence definitions at an academic level, and have influenced law enforcement strategies, and these influences have caused female perpetrators to walk free, and male victims to be mistakenly arrested and prosecuted instead ([source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265747881_Disabusing_the_definition_of_domestic_abuse_How_women_batter_men_and_the_role_of_the_feminist_state)).  Male victims of domestic violence are often afraid of reporting their abuse for fear that they might be arrested instead of their abuser ([source](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1997-36466-000)).\n* The legal definition of rape is defined in such a way that women cannot legally rape a man, meaning that male victims of rape often cannot prosecute their attackers ([source](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/1)).  This legal definition is influenced by the feminist definition of rape, which only counts \"insertion\" and not \"made to insert\" as a form of rape.  These flawed legal and academic definitions of rape have skewed years of statistics and data on the topic, and have allowed countless numbers of female rapists to walk free.\n* Awareness of sexual assault and other forms of violence against men, by women, is virtually non-existent.  Men are equally likely to be raped as women are ([source](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known/)), and women are equally likely to commit domestic violence against men as the reverse ([source 1](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/32b9/67aa6ff64264da8c7a67895c516032ff023e.pdf), [source 2](http://web.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm)).  Men receive very little recognition as potential victims, and are instead vilified as being abusers.  Societal conversations that include these topics are incredibly sexist against men, and male victims receive virtually no support or attention ([source 1](http://webshare.law.ucla.edu/Faculty/bibs/stemple/Stemple-SexualVictimizationPerpetratedFinal.pdf), [source 2](https://beaveronline.co.uk/lack-of-support-for-male-victims-of-sexual-harassment-at-lse/)).  Research indicates that one of the main reasons for this is because data about male victimization directly contradicts the social narrative that \"radical-feminists\" are trying to push.  In fact, \"radical-feminists\" often attack and argue against the validity of this research ([source](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-19716-004)), which has the effect of further marginalizing men and male victims of abuse.\n\nI think, just from these examples, it is clear that women hold a substantial amount of power, influence, and privilege in society.  Men's issues can be, and often are, caused by women (whether or purpose or not).  And in particular, gender feminism has been a strong force of misandry and discrimination in society over the years, *a fact that other feminists have been very prominent in pointing out themselves*.\n\nNext time someone tries to argue that men can't be marginalized or discriminated against because men somehow hold more power in society, remember to point out that this is simply not true.  Women hold a substantial amount of power in society, and this power has been used in many different areas to enforce gender norms, and defend the status quo, in ways that often benefit women over men.\n\n___\n####References\n#######1.

    "text": "Feminism: Enabling Female Psychopaths Men and women, and gender fluid, nonbinary, persons of colour, LGBTIQ+ persons, (and definitely not privileged white men), we got a lot right in the Western world since World War 2. Two things amaze me about the organization of Western society. One, society has so effectively removed the opportunities for the psychopathic individuals to thrive with one exception. Two, that one exception is feminist psychopathy directed to men.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTeachers can't smack, gropers get caught on camera and imprisoned, there's enough prosperity that generally people have an option other than staying when their romantic partner is abusive, workplace bullying no longer flies like it used to, by and large violence between men is far less tolerated, child abuse is not kept silent about but every effort is expended in its prevention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn other words, the many 'hunting grounds' the psychopath might have previously used to express his or her disregard for the rights of others have been closed off or at least curtailed severely. However, all is not lost for the psychopath, because a new hunting ground has been opened with a numerous prey, and all one needs to be given an open season ticket to hunt is a vagina. (No, sorry MTFs, I doubt a surgically constructed one would give you full hunting rights, but you could always try).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe major thing I have noticed in the course of my life is the manner in which feminism has given massive cover for antisocial and psychopathic women to harm men. It's the only context that I'm aware of in Western societies where this 'privilege' exists. Try treating blacks, Asians, Hispanics, spastics, the blind, homosexuals, Muslims or Parsis like this, and you'll lose your job quicker than you can say, 'our company doesn't stand for discrimination'. But treat a man this way, go right ahead! Because if you are a psychopathic woman mistreating a man YOU WILL NOT FACE SOCIETY'S USUAL CENSURE AND CONDEMNATION OF SUCH BEHAVIOUR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have experienced this myself, from quite an early age in fact, although generally speaking I believe I have avoided the harsher edge of this reality. Employment is the obvious context this comes to mind - a female boss or even colleague can make hell for a male subordinate, she's got cover. If the guy were to do a tenth of that to a woman, he'd be up before HR with, 'do it again and you're out', warning at the very least. I don't know how it is in America, but in Australia my understanding is female managers are brought in directly so they can work on firing a sufficiently difficult female staff member - the male managers are scared of doing it, so will often be swapped out for the termination process. I've mostly had very good female bosses, but the behavior of some women colleagues I've dealt with (and yes, they were disproportionately lesbian) clearly indicated that they had cover AND THEY KNEW THEY HAD COVER.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the problem, women in Western society know they've got cover when they have a dispute or conflict with a man. This kind of imbalance is always a problem, it's destabilizing, but that's not what I'm talking about here, the everyday woman getting her way because she knows she can. I'm talking about the genuinely antisocial and psychopathic woman, the woman who has a genuine contempt for humanity. This is a very small subset of the human population, but they cause enormous havoc and harm. We cannot do anything, as a society, to stop a certain number of psychopaths growing to maturity every year, they are an indelible part of the tapestry of human existence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut while in the past we've often allowed them to predate because of indifference - who cares about the poor? - or fear - I'd better not criticize Stalin. I cannot think of a time, before the current state of affairs emerged somewhere in the 1990s as far as I can tell, where we have without a violent change of government given them complete cover for their actions, and in fact supported them in the very process of their psychopathic abuse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I was young in the early 1990s my older sibling, who was sometimes violent, poured boiling coffee on my back. I had to get burns treatment at the local hospital, and the young male doctor there asked me if my father had done it. No, I said, my sibling did it. He asked the question, while he treated me, about three additional times. A more suggestible kid could easily have given the answer he was so clearly fishing for. I remember years later, a fully fledge adult, I talked to a therapist. He wanted to know all about how abusive and violent my father was (somewhat abusive, virtually never violent). He sympathized, he understood. But he didn't want to hear me say anything negative about my mother, who I certainly believe had psychopathic tendencies and who has wrought mental destruction on my siblings, particularly my younger sister. At the time it didn't register, but later I started thinking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was watching a YouTube video that discussed the fact that men's rights groups were banned as student clubs on Canadian campuses. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s4sZi8zjzY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s4sZi8zjzY) here's the link. A woman and man who appeared to be from ethnic minority backgrounds argued up hill and down dale why such groups were an evil fifth column that should be banned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe woman, who appeared to be Indian Canadian, even suggested men's groups might be more acceptable if they talked about 'the real issues', such as the plight of 'men of color' and 'transgender men', and she intimated that her white fellow panelist, supportive of freedom of speech, should zip it, and, all class, she seemed to mock him being of an older generation. She and the other man who spoke in her support against men's rights - who also appeared to belong to an ethnic minority, but seemed to be motivated more by sureing up his liberal credentials for political reasons than psychopathy - hinted that 'straight white men' should put up and shut up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen there are the news reports Canada will give 95% of its foreign aid for women and girls. Well, that's nice...if you're a psychopath, and somehow find boys dying of HIV in Africa okay while girls dying of HIV in Africa not okay. Anyone who has lived in a developing country knows this is what it means, it's not some theoretical institute that spouts hatred we're talking about, it's for the basics - and the Canadian government has literally said girls' lives matter, little boys' lives don't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've heard female family court judges expressly say they love the job because they can use it to deny custody to fathers. It's not so much the fact women are helped when men aren't that disturbs me - sure, it's unfair that men don't get special teaching places reserved for them to balance the gender numbers, but women get engineering places because WE MUST have gender balanced numbers there. But what I'm talking about is seeing the malice of genuinely psychopathic women given extraordinary rein to harm and injure men, and inevitably, their girlfriends and wives and children. I have seen time and again so many feminists truly motivated more by a desire to hurt men than help women. Brett Kavanaugh, an innocent man with wife and daughters - fuck it, hurting him with disproven falsehoods is more important than considering the welfare impact of this on his wife and daughters. It is more important to hurt a man than help a woman, which would make sense to the psychopath, right, because the psychopath disregards everyone except themselves including women. It's just that the direct harm is allowed to be delivered to the man, and all well and good if the indirect harm then flows to the women in that man's life. What isn't allowed, under feminisms perverted rules, is for the harm to be directed DIRECTLY to another woman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt reminded me of what Cassie Jaye said in an interview, if I'm paraphrasing right, feminism isn't about helping women, it's about helping feminism. I'd go a step further, feminism isn't about helping women, it's about hurting men directly even if this indirectly hurts the women connected to men.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will be blunt. The majority of the most extremely hateful behavior I've seen has been from women who either openly self-identify as, or who the inferential evidence indicates are, lesbian. I've seen it from both straight and lesbian women, but I would say most of the most extreme psychopathic and antisocial behavior I have seen by women against men has been from lesbian women. I am not saying lesbian women have a greater incidence of psychopathy, I do not know if there is - or whether there would even be allowed to take place - research into this. But this is what I have seen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to leave everyone on a negative note. So I'd just like to add that this problem has gotten consistently worse over the last 20 years I have observed it and every indication is it is going to continue to get worse. There appears to be no catalyst or force to change this, and so, I would expect, an increase in psychopathic and antisocial behavior in society by a small minority of women against a lot of men.",

    "text": "International Women are Good Men Are Bad Day Hi ladies and  gents, if you live in the northern hemisphere you're probably still 'enjoying' the celebrations for International Women's Day. Now if this day was a celebration of women, motherhood, women's achievements, et cetera, I'd be enjoying it too, and have a glass of sparkling grape juice and a piece of cake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut as a bigger, older school bully might say to you when you explain to her you need your lunch money, 'that's not how it works!'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's easy for men to celebrate women's achievements, and vice-versa, and at a superficial level that's not a zero sum game. However, when the tire hits the road, and we get into the real stuff like who gets the kids, who gets the university place, who gets the good job, and who gets a long prison sentence because their ex wants to say, 'yes, we did it like bunny rabbits for 5 years, but the last time was just horrible, I didn't want to and he should have known!', IT IS A ZERO SUM GAME To me, and my 'unconsciously biased' and 'white privileged' and 'arsehole and the cause of all human problems' eyes, feminism is not about equality, it is about increasingly advantaging group A (women) at the detriment of group B (men). And not a bit, crazy much. Don't get me wrong, most of this - except the kids bit - won't affect elite men and women, the top 5% can build their own businesses and make themselves the boss, feminism can't and won't attempt to influence this sort of thing. Their exes, who are likely also elites, will have too much to lose by making false claims and grueling through the justice process out for years, so they're unlikely to make them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo selfish men in the top 5% of the income bracket, please stop reading now, enjoy your life, and forget about the enormous lifelong harms and disruptions injustly happening to other men.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow back to the point, IT IS A ZERO SUM GAME. It doesn't have to be - anyone who's had a good relationship with the opposite sex knows that. But as time goes on, I'm beginning to think the feminists who came after the Bolshevik revolution (so not the Suffragettes), were probably girls with pretty bad form sheets (several men, none who lasted) who always intended to create a zero sum game where women 'win' and men lose. Now of course, feminism clearly accepts the inevitable side effect of creating a zero sum game involving sex and/or marriage with the rules totally tilted against one player - the marriages don't last so well anymore. This is also not an accident, destabilizing marriage where monogamous, lifelong male female marriage becomes an exception rather than a norm was a primary goal of post Bolshevik feminism very early. You can see it in the Philippines - which is such an odd country as divorce is still illegal there - who is out there arguing for legalization of divorce? You got it, the women's rights movement. Philippines' divorce law is odd, as no other real country prohibits divorce, and I'm not actually defending the law - it seems outrageous to apply a Catholic standard of divorce for example to atheists, Muslims, or Episcopalians) - my point is, who's agitating for divorce? Feminists. Philippines is a valuable example because what we see is the progressive nature of feminism.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst it's divorce, fine, that's gender neutral. Then it's no-fault divorce, well, fine, still gender neutral, although it causes massive spike in the divorce rate. But now the zero-sum part comes in - courts award custody of children to mothers, hey not so gender neutral, more zero-sum. Then, we've suddenly got a significant percentage of the population being divorced women with kids - hey the state needs to look after them. So there's welfare for single parents, again zero-sum with women 'winning' as they are the single parents. Now divorce is a cost-free option, because the state will carry the tab. Then UNMARRIED single mothers say, 'hey, what about me!', so now anyone who has a baby gets looked after by the state.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was once on a motorbike in Thailand. And a sad-looking, young-looking, not-pretty-looking Dutch woman came after me like a Cheetah wanting to mate with a Dachshund. All over me, wanting to come to my room. I must have friended her on Facebook or something, but did not go with her suggestion she come and stay in my room. A few years later I look on Facebook, sure enough a little white baby boy is born in Holland, sans-father. I don't blame this woman for having a baby, she was lonely and wanted one, and the Dutch state took care of the tab.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo that's one zero-sum game. But let's get now to couples, people who marry or are de-factos. If you live in any western country here's how it goes: You'd better forgive her for her occasional adulterous 'indiscretions' or 'you'll get what's coming to you'. If you've got kids, she'll get them - if you fight hard enough you'll get to see them, sometimes. She'll decide where they go to school, what they eat, wear, what out of school activities they do, what religion or no religion they follow, and how many boyfriends she brings back to meet them. If you have daughters, they will have the fortune of seeing and having modelled that women can have a 'healthy sexuality' as the wife leaves her husband and brings back a series of male lovers over a period of years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh and of course, the money. Elites are a little bit different. But for the majority of the population, she'll get most of the assets - even if it was paid for by the husband's earnings. She'll also get a regular cut of your income - after all husbands should pay for the care of children they're denied to see, that's perfectly fair, isn't it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen there's jobs. Got a profession like nursing or teaching predominantly female - that's fine. I went to a bank the other today and out of the 10 staff in the bank, 1 was male, the rest including manager and all seniors female. The lady Asian teller, who I'm normally very friendly with, got quite angry when I suggested it didn't look like the best bank branch for male job applicants. All deans of all faculties female (like RMIT University in Melbourne was), fine, most paediatric doctors female, fine. Too many senior board executives male - OH NO WE MUST FIX IT. Jobs predominantly male must have female quotas, jobs predominantly female should be left alone - ZERO SUM GAME people. Boy Scouts must allow girls, Girl Guides need not allow boys. I saw in the newspaper in Melbourne today that Geelong Grammar can discriminate and give scholarships only to girls. Does anyone reading this believe that any mixed private school in Melbourne would be given dispension to give scholarships only to boys?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo it's zero-sum game across the board: children, relationships, marriage, school, jobs...but let's get to the really good one, 'crimes against women and children'. So all this stuff I've mentioned above would still not keep down an entrepreneurial man who runs his own business. If he is his own boss, well, it's easy for him to hide income so his ex gets less - which would tend to press her to the negotiating table re: the kids - and he won't pass himself over for promotion because he is a man in his own business, so his own talent is his only limit. Now such a man might get uppity, and think he was equal with women, and go around doing a lot offensive male things like being assertive, picky about a women's sexual background and divorce history, and just being self-confident and living without fear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan this really be tolerated? The feminists came up with the solution to that one too, let's change the law whenever a guy is charged with a crime against a woman - ie. the ex girlfriend who cries rape. Let's reveal his identity in the newspaper, but make hers protected upon penalty of contempt of court. Let's make him testify in open court, but let's let her testify remotely via video. Oh and if there's a hung jury, because some sexist jury member goes, 'oh wait, she was banging him the Tuesday before, and sexting, but how come she's saying rape on the Thursday?', guess what - she doesn't have to testify again, the court can just reply her recorded testimony. Oh yeah, and we can't ask her about her sexual history, or say that the fact, you know, she had sex with her boyfriend for years might mean it wasn't rape. I'm not making this stuff up - it differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but there are a complete raft of these laws trying to engineer convictions. It often works, but not always. I spoke to a female former teacher of mine from University years ago, and she told me about a rape trial she was a jury member on. Finally the jury didn't convict because the 'victim' about an hour after her rape went and had sex with her boyfriend - the sexist jury didn't believe that a woman who was raped by her friend (not a cheating girlfriend, how dare you!) would go and then have sex with her boyfriend an hour later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank God I've never had to deal with false charges brought against me - and let's face it, the system would grind to a halt if it started getting out of hand - but just the fear of false claim again is used to oppress and strike fear into the hearts of men. I'm not that worried by it, but mostly because I don't want to have flings with tarty looking girls with bad histories, and I think every man in his right mind would be aware of this and have some sort of risk management plan for it - this, itself, is fear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook, I've gone on and on, and I could go on and on even further. But I won't. I would celebrate Women's Day if it wasn't for the fact that it's really, 'help women, harm men' day. It doesn't have to be like this, but it likely will continue to be so for the rest of our lives. In summation I have one point:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeminists realise their objective is a ZERO SUM GAME where there is a definite winner (women) and loser (men). Men and women who are not feminists need to realise the same thing, and the sooner the better.",

    "text": "The Ministry of Love: Ongoing Gender Partisanship in the Department of Education   \n\nOrwell’s famous dystopia *1984* is often cited as a parable  about the banality of administrative evil. The ever-vigilant bureaucrats  of Oceania position themselves not only on the Left side of history,  but also at its *end.* To err from their ideology is treason.\n\nThe citizens of Oceania live in a state of self-imposed hypnosis  where they have to pretend that even the simplest of words signify their  exact opposites. The government agency that specializes in espionage  and torture is thus called *The Ministry of Love*. The Ministry views every sexual act as a potential crime unless proven otherwise via affirmative surveillance.\n\nImagine a federal agency that has invested itself with the authority  to monitor the most private details of citizens to root out sexual  heresy. Imagine a federal  agency which once contemplated [installing security cameras](http://pgbovine.net/OET-Draft-Grit-Report-2-17-13.pdf) in every classroom in order to monitor the facial and optical muscles of all students nationwide.\n\nThis agency was so devoted to its ideological mission that it never presented its [unconstitutional rules](https://www.thefire.org/did-the-office-for-civil-rights-april-4-dear-colleague-letter-violate-the-law/) to the American public to consult their opinion, considered itself to be [a superior alternative](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-students-are-fighting-for-title-ix_b_58e27314e4b0ca889ba1a848) to the criminal justice system, granted itself [universal jurisdiction](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/01/19/feds-find-buffalo-state-failed-investigate-alleged-sexual-assault-created-hostile), threatened many colleges with financial death unless they punished [constitutionally protected speech](https://www.nas.org/blogs/dicta/ocrs_new_sexual_harassment_guidelines_threaten_academic_freedom_due_process), sought to abolish the [“reasonable person” standard](https://reason.com/2016/09/12/ocr-to-frostburg-state-university-common), and created [a class of imitative bureaucrats](https://www.nas.org/blogs/dicta/gender_inequity_among_the_gender_equity_enforcers) in academic institutions to perpetuate an industry of victimhood.\n\nImpossible, you think? We have just objectively described the record  of the Department of Education’s civil rights branch, the Office for  Civil Rights.\n\nThe Office for Civil Rights (OCR) received bipartisan and  professional criticism for its unconstitutional actions during the Obama  administration. Formal critics include the [Federalist Society](https://regproject.org/wp-content/uploads/RTP-Race-Sex-Working-Group-Paper-Campus-Misconduct-Proceedings.pdf), [Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/crime-and-justice/report/campus-sexual-assault-understanding-the-problem-and-how-fix-it), [National Association of Scholars](https://www.nas.org/articles/nas_applauds_secretary_devos_decision_on_title_ix),[ California Governor Jerry Brown](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-browns-title-ix-veto-1508280834), [Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg](https://reason.com/blog/2018/02/19/ruth-bader-ginsburg-due-process-me-too),  [American College of Trial Lawyers](https://www.actl.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/position-statements-and-white-papers/task_force_allegations_of_sexual_violence_white_paper_final.pdf), and [Reason Foundation](https://reason.com/blog/2017/09/07/betsy-devos-rape-ocr-title-ix-campus).\n\nMoreover, courts that have heard cases involving OCR’s Title IX  procedures have often strongly denounced them. Examples include  condemnatory opinions from the [Second Circuit of Appeals](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/15-1536/15-1536-2016-07-29.html) and the [Sixth Circuit of Appeals](http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/18a0200p-06.pdf). In a recent [Seventh Circuit of Appeals](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/17-3565/17-3565-2019-06-28.html)  opinion, Judge Barrett stated that “Purdue’s process fell short of what  even a high school must provide to a student facing a days-long  suspension.” Professor KC Johnson [has covered the case in greater detail. ](https://www.city-journal.org/john-doe-v-purdue-univ)\n\nObama’s OCR espoused a particular brand of radical feminism.  According to this doctrine, taught across the nation in women’s studies  departments, men have brutalized women since the beginning of history.  Past oppression must be remedied through government intervention,  eliminating the due process principles that are meant to protect every  American.\n\nThe perils of government tyranny aside*,* the fundamental  assumptions of the “patriarchy theory” cannot survive rational scrutiny.  While it is true that women were historically denied various rights,  they have also been sheltered from grievous harm (combat, for example).  Also, analysis of federal aggregate data from the United States  demonstrates that women are [as likely to engage in sexual coercion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062022/) against men as [vice versa](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178916301446?via%3Dihub), which undermines the “patriarchy” narrative.\n\nAt any rate, past historical wrongs cannot be rectified by unfair treatment in the present, as the Eighth Circuit stated in [this ruling](https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca8/18-3077/18-3077-2019-03-06.pdf?ts=1551889833).\n\nOCR’s historical record speaks to its lack of fairness. The agency  authored a total of 255 resolution letters (formal decisions in a case)  from 2012 to 2019.\n\n[Pekgoz summarizes the circumstances in a Synthetic Analysis](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ea7b71_a751c44c74dc4e8fa8f35666ab9b81a1~mv2_d_3812_2108_s_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_3812,h_2108/PrintScreen%2C%20Synthetic%20Analysis.jpg).\n\nThe analysis shows that whenever OCR wrote a resolution letter  between 2012 and 2019 to adjudicate adversarial proceedings between  female and male parties, they sided with the female 216 times but only 9  times with the male (2400% more likely to side with the female). Their extreme partisanship is clear in every  aspect of Title IX.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Athletics.** The Department’s athletics compliance tests have been [rightfully criticized](https://www.nccivitas.org/2010/title-ix-blind-quota-system-or-how-kneecap-college-sports/)  for imposing unconstitutional quotas. The agency sided with female  athletes 63 times, but sided with the male only once between 2012 and  2019. The only resolution letter favorable for male athletes is the [Temple University Letter](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/03142257-a.pdf).\n* **Grading.** The Department sided with female students who alleged [discrimination](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/06112126-a.pdf) in [grading](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11162077-a.pdf) on [multiple occasions](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/15132147-a.pdf), while dismissing [very similar allegations by male students](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/07132238-a.pdf).\n* **Retaliation.** The Department sided with female  complainants alleging retaliation on many occasions. There are at least  23 letters in this category, such as the [Jacksonville State University Letter](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/04142086-a.pdf)  where the agency sided with a “falsely accused” woman. There is no  clear example of the Department siding with a male student alleging  retaliation on the basis of sex, [but dismissal letters do exist](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/10111376-a.pdf).\n* **Sexual Harassment.** Male students who petitioned the  agency to allege bias in sexual harassment disputes (either as the  accused, or the accuser) had a success rate of 1.1 percent during  2012-2019 (6/532). The Department was very aggressive when it came to  siding with female accusers while consistently dismissing the concerns  of accused males. This is despite male students often suffering  life-altering consequences, such as expulsion or a permanent notation on  their transcript, in addition to severe emotional distress. [Some have committed suicide](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/05/02/title-ix-cases-resulted-suicide-suicide-attempt-two-colleges-prompt-fresh-debate).\n* **Reasonableness.** OCR urged schools to get rid of the  “reasonable person” standard at least twice:  One letter involved a  female student who accused a male teacher of [staring at her breasts for 3-4 seconds](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/09141376-a.pdf). Another letter involved a costly systemic review because very young students [were playing “National Grab Ass Day”](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11131106-a.pdf) during play time. The agency even sided with a female student whose claims of sexual violence [were disproven via DNA evidence](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/15112115-a.pdf).\n* **Due Process.** While sending a dismissal letter to an accused male student, OCR argued that [“due process” is not covered by Title IX](https://www.scribd.com/document/426012564/Samuel-Meritt-University-Dismissal).  As long as the accused is a man, that is. Federal bureaucrats  aggressively sided with women who were accused of various sexual  infractions. On one occasion, the Department condemned a university for  allowing a male [to file a counter-claim](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11116001-a.pdf) of misconduct against a female student. Another time, the agency [threatened a university](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/01102089-a.pdf)  with loss of federal funding for pressing fraud charges against a woman  who made false accusations. There is also an example of OCR using [defamation theory to side with a female complainant](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11141175-a.pdf), even though the agency has never accepted any complaints concerning the damaged reputations of accused men.\n* **Single-Sex Programs.** Women are the majority of college students, but many colleges offer dozens of support programs [for women only](https://www.jamesgmartin.center/2019/05/identity-politics-versus-basic-logic-should-colleges-offer-affirmative-action-for-the-female-majority/).  Whenever male complainants challenge female-only programs, such as  women’s centers or STEM camps for girls, the Department has dismissed  their complaints on various pretexts. One popular pretext is that these  female-only programs cannot be challenged unless men specifically apply  to them and receive rejections, thus creating a putative victim.  However, OCR has resolved [procedural complaints in the absence of any victim](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/02152290-a.pdf) on many occasions, as long as the objective [was consistent with their agenda. ](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/03121217-a.pdf)\n* **American Psychological Association (APA) Guidelines.** OCR dismissed a Title IX complaint challenging the APA guidelines, which sought to [classify masculinity as a mental illness factor](https://www.dailywire.com/news/46458/foia-request-reveals-boston-title-ix-office-has-ashe-schow).  This was despite serious public outcry against those guidelines. In the  dismissal letter, officials argued that Title IX cannot be applied in a  manner that would interfere with curricular materials. That was false.  OCR has aggressively interfered with [the training materials](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11142219-a.pdf) and [the curricular materials](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11131096-a.pdf) of [various colleges](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/10131040-a.pdf) as long as doing so furthers their gender agenda.\n* **Administrative Closure.** OCR has a rule requiring  the dismissal of pending complaints if similar allegations have been  filed elsewhere. This rule is rigorously applied [to male students to dismiss their Title IX complaints.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3479594-Stanford-University-09-15-2324.html) However, when [female students file complaints against their institutions](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/office-civil-rights-launches-investigation-university-southern-californias-handling-sexual-harassment-claims), administrative closure is not applied to dismiss their allegations.\n\nSome might assume that OCR has received few meritorious complaints  from male students. According to a Freedom of Information Act request,  however, the Department received [532 complaints](https://www.scribd.com/document/426016051/FOIA-All-532-Cases-With-545-Relevant-Allegations) from men in the sexual harassment category alone between 2011 and 2019.\n\nThe Department of Education became a hive of identity politics under  Obama and there is little evidence of improvement. The modest reforms  proposed by Secretary Betsy DeVos have not yet been implemented.\n\nResolution letters published under the Trump administration perpetuate the Obama doctrines. For example, [the Stanford University letter](https://provost.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/04/OCR-Redacted-Stanford-Letter-of-Finding.pdf) tried to eliminate the reasonable person standard. [The Butte-Glenn Community College letter](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/09132096-a.pdf) involved a retroactive review of many old complaints, demanding the creation of a complex bureaucracy. [The Buffalo State University letter](https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/media/OCR-SUNY-Buffalo-State.pdf) wrongfully claimed that off-campus incidents fall under the jurisdiction of Title IX, [despite case law to the contrary.](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-8th-circuit/1410731.html)\n\nUnsurprisingly, some politicians want to abolish the entire Department of Education. Representative Thomas Massie has [introduced a bill](https://massie.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rep-massie-introduces-bill-to-abolish-federal-department-of-education)  to do just that. While we cannot predict whether the Department will  ever be abolished, we must never cease our vigilance against our very  own *Ministry of Love.* \n\n*Kursat Christoff Pekgoz is a PhD student at the University of Southern California.*\n\n*James E.

    "text": "Advice For Young Men Hi, I want to write this post for young men, say guys teens to 25, regarding my personal views of how young men might deal with the challenges of living within a feminist authoritarian society (ie. all Western countries).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think my starting point would be, YES realise the reality of a system that TENDS to binarily present women as having virtuous qualities and men as having vice-like qualities - that there is both public defamation of men and celebration of women, but also numerous actual laws and policies designed to promote women and constrain or retard men. Examples? Reserve jobs for women in male dominated industries (engineering), don't do it for men in female dominated industries (education, some higher education), let women use the Hague convention on child removal to recover their kids, but not men.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo once you have this starting point of awareness, my thoughts are a young man SHOULD NOT preoccupy on it and should get on and live his life. That means going on and doing all possible to advance his career (in the private sector a man may face less discrimination than in public service, in some academic environments in Australia a man would be a fool to pursue this career thread if he seeks to reach high office). It also means to lock in a reasonable woman as lifelong partner. Because of the imbalance of the genders' rights, responsibilities and powers the system appears to add lots of problems to the men in heterosexual relationships, but from what I have seen this is less of a problem for couples that met up at a young age. To put it bluntly, if you're 21-22, etc, lock in that 19 year old and build something she doesn't want to burn down no matter how much the feminists tell her to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I would suggest focusing on investing in relationships with family of origin (with the common sense caveat of not investing in abusive, non reciprocating people), particularly female family members. So that is sisters particularly, but further across, aunts, nieces, female cousins etc. The reason for this is women's access to their children is rarely compromised in relationship breakdown - so women relatives will generally be happier as they come out better off in relationship breakdown - and therefore, they generally will have more emotional reserves to help their own biological male relatives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would on balance advise against getting too involved in men's rights, or even lurking here on reddit on the men's rights sub too much - once you realise the state of affairs, there's no point wallowing in the injustice. Get on with life avoiding many of the pitfalls so many here have fallen into. Maybe when you're older, very established, or whatever, such a man will be really helpful for the men's rights movement. Maybe his wife, daughter, or other family member will be an even more valuable spokesperson. But the point is, keep it to yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are my thoughts only. The way I see it now, improving legal conditions or media portrayal of men is a totally unrealistic goal, and for me the goal is simply to help men internally realise what is going on. That, to me, is a valuable outcome and realistic goal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest of luck any young man reading this. If we could but put old heads on young shoulders...",

    "text": "“You’re not having kids?!” -ugh So, I was visiting family in West Virginia for the 4th of July weekend. Somehow it came up that I don’t want to have kids. And my one great aunt just couldn’t let it go. At one point she even asked if I wasn’t able to have kids. I mean...excuse me? And it wasn’t just that, she picked on me all throughout our time for not being the stereotypical woman. About a year ago I was gifted one of my late great grandma’s antique sewing machines. I told my aunt that I was intending to take it to a professional to have it cleaned and oiled to keep it in good condition. I thought she would be happy that I cared enough to take it to a professional. But she gave me shit that I didn’t know how to do it myself. She was asking me what I do like as a hobby, and why I don’t sew, and I said that I work too much and don’t have time. And she said well I don’t think it’s possible to work too much. And then we were talking about my dogs and she’s like oh that’s why you don’t have time for babies. Wtf? Of course, it doesn’t help that my brother is really into fake sword fighting and was sewing his own garb for his stupid sword fights while we were there. She just kept fawning over him and how amazing it was that he’s sewing. So apparently it’s ok for my brother to sew, but god forbid I be a badass engineer bitch. I’m great at what I do, I love what I do, and ya, I work too much, but I love it. I travel the world and live without fear and collaborate with my international colleagues, but I don’t sew and I don’t want kids, so I suck at being a woman I guess.",
