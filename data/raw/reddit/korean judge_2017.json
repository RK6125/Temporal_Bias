    "text": "I'm healing from an abusive relationship with a narcissist that ended 2.5 months ago. I could use some advice.. or simply an ear. Hi everyone. I don't really have anyone to bare my heart to right now. I want to send this out to the universe and see what comes back. I would love to hear your perspectives.. whatever corner of the world you're in.. whatever life path you've walked. I really appreciate all your voices and Reddit so so much. I'll try to keep it condensed and simple. \n\nI dated a narcissist for eight months. He was incredibly cruel and selfish but hooked me with rare very special moments of revealing a deeply hurt.. damaged.. wholesome.. helplessly pure childlike heart. He would verbally and emotionally abuse me but sometimes with time, he would realize how hurtful or selfish his actions were. With sincere tears in his eyes he would apologize and express that he's learning and wants to change.. express that his cruel actions and words are purely from ignorance because even his own mother never showed him any love, open-heartedness, gentleness, morals. \n\nIt doesn't come as a surprise.. he experienced a horribly abusive heartbreaking childhood. He used that excuse almost always. And being an empath.. my heart opened and poured for him, I wanted to love him more. Help him see all women aren't money hungry and out to lie and cheat. Show him it's okay to open and be vulnerable. My upbringing wasn't perfect either. I honestly felt we were both \"breaking\" our cycles of hurt from the abuse and neglect our parents created. (My family was very poor growing up and my father abandoned my mother, sister and I when I was 12.) He always said such amazing things about growing old together.. building character through experience.. being there for eachother.. building a life and family together that's strong and confident (him) but sensitive giving and loving (me). He would say I am the best person he's ever met with character he values most above anything. That I have changed his life forever in all aspects of his life.. work. And I was learning a lot about patience, understanding, and forgiveness. No relationship is flawless and flatlined. I appreciate and value rolling with the punches of life. Struggle is what makes you grow.. its what broadens and builds your mind and heart, I love that. And I love the idea of a life partner who is down to walk the sometimes mountainous path of life with you. I appreciate open-mindedness and the will to adapt. Effort is so beautiful. Anyway.. I honestly believed we could awaken together.. Live more and more with awareness.. and mindfulness.. and learn together. But I was wrong. He would do things like tell me his ex was exceptionally beautiful.. she was a professional model.. but I'm pretty. His other ex is very smart. But I'm definitely not smart. I'm talented and creative. But not smart because my brain is not wired to be a coder or engineer. This is one of the most painful parts. I stayed with a man who fought me and defended himself for the right to call me stupid.. many times. He would tell me my problems are trivial.. that he doesn't care about my pleasure.. several times he would fuck me and just roll over. I would silently cry in the dark and masturbate next to him as he snored. We fought so many times about our sex life. It was always selfish and only about him. There were times I would be very ill or very drunk and he would just go ahead and fuck me.. even when I'm barely conscious. I would just lie there in the fetal position. He said that was one of the great things about me.. \"I never left him wanting.\" He was so proud that he's slept with 120 women. He told me I was the first one he gave eye contact with when having sex. And he said he typically didn't kiss the girls he'd sleep with. That I have no idea how much he's changed. I brought this up so many times.. that I want to make love.. sex should be us sharing how we feel physically.. it's about both of us..and he just didn't care. He would say sometimes sex is just carnal and sometimes he needs to be a man and take it. It's just about him. I never once orgasmed in the 8 months we dated. He never tried. It was always for him. He went down on me maybe 3 times in 8 months. He blamed it on me. He said some women aren't confident or comfortable orgasming in front of people. He would say some girls orgasmed as soon as he put his dick in them. Typing this out I know it sounds fucking heartbreaking and pathetic. I know. If I heard all this from my sister or if my future daughter were telling me all this... I would be utterly mortified and devastated for them. Sometimes it's very hard to see unobstructed reality when you're struggling in the middle of everything. He would fall asleep after I drove 22 miles to talk about how he's hurt me as I am crying next to him in his bed. He once dropped me on the side of the road with all my luggage to take an uber home after a road trip when I said I wanted to go back to my apartment, not his. \n\nHe has a very unhealthy relationship with sex. He was once over 500 pounds but with sheer will.. starving and lifting he lost 230lbs. From age 30 to 35 he overcompensated by \"fucking and conquering as many women as possible doing whatever it takes to make them comfortable\" His greatest fantasy is rape. He would often tell me his greatest \"id\" fantasy is to kick down a door like a Viking and violently rape a wife as his defenseless smaller frightened husband is forced to watch in horror. (My ex is 6'5) He used to \"jokingly\" say rape victims often orgasm because in a subconscious level they loved it. He would joke and say 50 shades of grey is about him.. and there's a reason why that franchise is insanely popular. Women love and want to be raped on a cave man level. He absolutely lovess the new Westworld for how brutal and fetishized rape, pleasures, violence, dominance, and indulgence is. He would often say when he looks around and thinks about it.. his character and life is similar to most leaders. The greatest leaders he knows arent emotional, overly caring, sensitive, \"squishy\" or giving. Superstar singers.. athletes.. businessmen like Steve jobs.. world famous video game designers.. they all have one thing in common. They \"lick the earth\" as he would put it.. and they dont hold back their id-driven desires. That is the source of their greatness and inspiration, especially as an artist. Being a sensitive \"squishy\" ..That all seemed so empty to me. \n\nHis dream is to have a line of hundreds of women waiting their turn to be fucked.. he impregnates them and doesn't take care of the babies. \"Like a Viking king\" He often said sex is a need. If he doesn't have sex in two weeks everyone starts to look like meat. He doesn't care. Men and women alike. I tried to understand the root of this manifestation. It was horrifying to hear but in all these stories.. all I saw was this nerdy obese kid who was ignored all of his life... a guy who was so ignored that he lost his virginity to a prostitute... this poor 7 year old boy who would be locked in his room for days by his horrible stepfather. His cries ignored by his cold mother to ensure her loans are paid by this new man. It all screamed suffering and heartbreak. Especially because I personally know several women who have experienced rape and I have been volunteering with The Rape Foundation for several years. I really tried not to judge. How can you.. life is crazy and sometimes devastating and sometimes you dealt difficult cards.. like your parents. And humans are capable of such cruelty.. a lot of times they genuinely think they're doing the right thing. We also got into many painful fights about his views on having children and marriage. He said he would absolutely test the blood of his babies. That was a deal breaker. I would explain how hurtful that is. He would say its not about me. It's statistics. Women will lie and have men financially support children that are not theirs. (This is what his mother did to his stepfather. When his stepfather found out. He began to abuse my ex from a very young age.) He also said 80% of women initiate divorce for the payday. So if marriage was a deal breaker he would consider \"many types of arrangements\" with the help of his lawyers. \n\nAnyway.. 8 months we dated. He made me cry 1-3 times a week. But when things were good we were both adventurous.. incredibly playful.. tender.. driven.. and affectionate. We both love similar music and movies. He would sing to me.. we loved going on long drives and talking about life.. this existence.. our hopes and dreams. We are both class clowns. But one thing was rawly clear. We were cut from different cloths. He's a big tall trump loving white guy from Texas who always lived in a big house.. no student loans.. went to art school.. atheist.. first job was after college for a video game company.. etc. I'm a Korean American from the east coast who was raised by a struggling single immigrant mother.. have had at least one job since high school.. lived in my car in NYC.. put myself through college thus have student debt (this was a big issue for us.. he said for him to even consider marrying me.. I would have to get rid of my debt. I'm the first one in my family to go to college).. insatiably curious about spirituality.. religions.. philosophy, the human condition. I am such a sensitive giving tender hopeless romantic easily hurt squishy. And he's just a confident iron fist, force. His mother and the rest of his family believe vulnerability and feelings equal weakness. A few times he was very vulnurable and shared how when he get married and starts a family, he plans to stay away from his family because they are all a very certain way. \"poverty mentality\" is what he would call it. He would share how his mom never cared.. and still doesnt care about his problems when he tries to open up to her. One time when he dumped me he said.. his mother is so strong she has never cried ever in his life. And I cry all the time. He would resent her for her hard coldness but I don't think he's aware of how attached and proud he is of her. He'd laugh and say \"my mom is a tempest. Shes the boss of the house, what she says goes, she gets her way, she's dominant she's fierce. She's a force.\" He would express how the other girlfriends he introduced to his mom were shredded apart and would end in tears going up against such an intimidating woman. I see right thru all that. His mom holds a tremendous amount of guilt. He never once talked to her about how her abandoned him while his step father would abuse him and lock him up. For days he would sleep on a bare mattress.. starve..  and go to the bathroom in the room. He said he became obese because of this feeling of having absolutely no control and not knowing when he'll eat again. It's so heartbreaking. When he got older his step dad and mom sent him away to a military school for delinquent kids. He would be locked in his dorm for days as well. He would beat kids up and created a group of friends that he \"protected\". Multiple times he told me about a very feminine kid who would massage him in exchange for his protection. My ex would explain if they locked him up in his dorm for a few more weeks he would have absolutely fucked that feminine kid. My gut tells me he did a lot at that school that he'll probably never tell anyone. \n\nI see thru all this. He and his mom have taught eachother to pretend like nothing happened. This is their way of comforting eachother.. pretending like it went away. As a woman.. as a super sensitive aware woman.. I know she's holding a lot of guilt and sadness. She's created such a tough persona she can't get herself to let it out. People will live a lifetime running from feeling. \n\nMy ex is incredibly charismatic to his coworkers and he's loved and well known at work. Many shy guys at his video game company idolize him and his ability to sleep with many women. He's this fearless jokester who is \"untouchable\". He is very proud of the fact that he hit the \"jackpot\" being born a tall white confident man. He has absolutely no one he's responsible for except for himself. Im very close to my mother and sister and when my parents divorced I pretty much stepped up and felt responsible for keeping the three of us together. Since high school I started to help financially support our family. He couldn't understand that. He'd simply say it's very good of me. \n\nAnyway..\nWe are such opposites and we knew this from day one. I was WAY too giving. I paid for amazing vacations because he had never snowboarded.. snowboarding was my life from middle school to college. I always drove to his place in Santa Monica (22 miles away from my place and my work.) I always planned amazing adventures.. things he's never done in LA. He surprised me with a candle lit dinner once. The first three times we ever went out to dinner was my idea and I treated him. He used to say I am the balance and light that will melt the ice and softened the thorns around his heart. I remember one time he was just in awe. He didn't own any plates or cups so we went to target and I got him some essentials. He said he had never been treated or cared like this. In the beginning, he did hand draw me pictures of me which was really touching. He had flowers sent to my work. Once after we fought and once after I stayed with him while he got a gal stone removed. He used to say he had never spent money like this for anyone. He used to never even buy girls drinks before taking them home. So many times I told him. I don't care about the money spent. Pick a dandelion for me. Let's share a mcdonalds apple pie on the beach. It's the thought care and effort that is so special. He just never got it. \n\nHonestly as the days pass and I continue to practice Shambhala meditation, contemplation and mindfulness.. I see I was YEARNING for that strong eternal male energy love... the love of an unconditionally loving caring father that I never had. He broke my heart 1-3 times a week for 8 months, honestly my heart and gut knew it was very wrong. But my yearning to fall in love.. to GIVE the love I hope to receive.. and the yearning to settle down blinded me. I gave the love that I wish to receive. Even though my ex didn't deserve it. The biggest lesson I am walking away with is why did I stay for so long. That's where I am going to learn and grow from. That's where my self love needs to focus on. Believing in someone.. believing in hope.. believing in good and forgiveness are all wonderful things but there needs to be an unbreakable boundary where my self respect and self worth isn't brutalized. And I need to have self love and strength to walk away. For good. Even when they're crying, apologizing, explaining, or making the most beautiful promises. \n\nThe very last week we spoke. I texted him in the morning after fighting the night before. He bit my head off about bothering him at work. I went silent after that. After several hours he emailed me explaining he fucked up and when he gets emotionally overwhelmed he doesn't know how to deal. He said he loved me.. loved what we've built.. that I am a ray of sunshine he has been able to capture and he will never give up. He said he was going to come over that night to fix things. \n\nI was so exhausted and broken.. I couldn't get myself to respond. I just didn't get it. Me caring.. me reaching out being affectionate.. texting him to see if he's okay.. all of that to him was nothing but an annoyance and a horrible burden. If you have so many excuses against it.. and so much aggression and aversion against it... why be in it? How can I apologize and be sorry for burdening you with my affection? Poisoning your life with my love? \n\nAfter getting no response for 5 hours he texted me. \"Actually I'm not coming tonight. I'm seeing other people.\" That was it. After a few days. I emailed him a couple times that I deserve a proper phone call break up. He unblocked my number and finally called me. Immediately he just unloaded his anger. He blamed everything on me. He said I have a personality disorder and as my friend he was begging me to get help. That everything was in my head and that I cry for no reason. He said he knew from the first week of dating that I was the problem but he felt bad for me and was tired of hopping from one girl to another so he stayed with me for 8 months. He said he is tall.. confident and white.. he makes a shit ton of money and he loves his life. He said \"I simply have TOO MANY choices.. our connection wasn't special at all and I will love again\" He said he had already fucked someone new and she is \"very sweet\". He went on a date with someone and \"she is fucking awesome\". I stayed on the phone as he said every single thing a hurt desperate person would say to try to convince himself that's he's okay.. he's in control.. he's not hurt.. and he's right and strong. \n\nWe often talked about the five love languages. He always said he only needs physical touch. And I need all five which he thought was crazy. I stayed on the phone with him as he described all the reasons why this new stranger he slept with was better than me. How her only love language is touch as well. He emailed me on Monday saying he will never give up, and by Thursday he had slept with someone new. As I listened to all this.. it finally clicked in my heart. That was it. All the hope and forgiveness and empty promises broke in me. He finally cut the remaining karmic tie between us. This was never about me. I was never going to make this guy happy and we were never going to work. All this horrible cruelty he was yelling into the phone... was his internal dialogue convincing himself that he is right, he is okay, he not hurt, he is not responsible. Having no control.. or being accountable for selfish hurtful actions causes him to lash out. He has such a fear of feeling things.. of getting hurt.. or having no control that he rather live a surface level life and cushion himself with yes people and agreeable circumstances that make his life easy and unchallenging in anyway. Control everything.\n\nThat, believe it or not is the shortish summary of my last 10 months. There are so many other examples and details but I have a feeling you guys get the picture. \n\nSo here I am today. It's been an up and down road to healing. Today my close friend sent me articles on the toxic relationship between empaths and narcissists. I am SHOCKED how accurate and to the T these articles capture our relationship. Our relationship was EXACTLY like how these articles explain it. Honestly... I wish fate would send these articles to him.. I even contemplated having my fiend or my sister email them to him. Is it wrong of me to care about his happiness and growth? Care about him opening his eyes to the destruction he's creating? Is it wrong of me that I don't violently hate him? I feel sad FOR him. I feel no need for relief by cursing him and saying cruel things. I have no need to fill any voids by sleeping with people and saying \"OH I am SO over him. OH he was horrible and I can do better.\" Life is vast and life is crazy. How can I condemn and judge anyone? That's just not me. You can't control certain cards you're dealt... like your upbringing. But you DO have the choice in how you live on from these experiences. That is what I do choose to examine. I wish him bravery and strength.. I wish that for anybody and everybody. I wish that for myself too! I'm working on it everyday. Strength to see myself and life without any veils. See my actions without any self deception. (Deception like cushioning your ego.. focusing on blame which is so empty and pointless.) Fear from not knowing what's gonna happen.. fear of having no control.. it's instinct to protect yourself. Your ego will protect itself with all kinds of destructive momentary relief (empty sex, alcohol, saying mean things to people and putting others down, etc.) I wanna see things for what they truly are. Be brave enough and have the wisdom to walk away when you know it's wrong and not meant for you. \n\nIs it wrong of me to hope that he'll learn the true root of happiness? It's not money or sex with hundreds of beautiful women. Or telling yourself how confident and awesome you are. How many people know you. (From the years of isolation.. all he did is draw alone in his room. Now he is a somewhat well known video game artist and director at a major video game company in LA.)\n\nLiving a full life is about living awake.. how much you open yourself to the world. How much you give and share. Vulnerability is true bravery and strength. Not cushioning your life with ease and agreeableness. But I realized.. who am I to force a lesson on anyone. Who am I to \"make\" someone wake up or realize things. Even if he were to have a.. \"shit.. now I see\" moment.. it takes consistent drive and desire to be awake and mindful... it takes time to change your habits. I just wanted to know what you guys think. Thank you for reading. I may be hurt and heartbroken but I am SO thankful for this experience. I think these lessons have really opened my eyes and I'm coming out stronger and a lot wiser. You definitely can be too open... too giving.. and too forgiving. \n\nhttps://dailyoccupation.com/2017/03/14/toxic-attraction-empath-narcissist/\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sense-and-sensitivity/201201/the-highly-sensitive-person-and-the-narcissist?amp\n\nAs the time passes I rawly see how completely lost I became. I lost myself and completely forgot who I am and what I'm worth. I became a deeply desperate and sad person. Everyday I yearned for the small crumbs of kindness and affection he would strategically give me.. especially in the form of verbal affirmation: telling me I'm the love of his life and he will never give up. But then check me by ogling and comment on women's bodies while we're out.. and keep me down on myself and insecure. He is truly manipulative with his words which in this world can take you far. It's rewarded. He was always very proud that he could get what he wanted.. especially with women. I also rawly see that how you treat and speak to others is a true reflection of how you treat and speak to yourself internally. If someone is so easily and freely able to be sooo mean and cruel to another living breathing FEELING human.. how is their internal dialogue with themselves and their self worth? \n\nThank you so much for the wonderful comments and messages. I cannot express how moved I am. Its even more special because we are all anonymous strangers yet we are all so interconnected in how we feel and the hardships we face. I am so thankful. I choose to take this painful experience and life lesson and continue to explore myself.. love myself... open myself to others.. and love. \n\nHe texted and emailed me a few weeks ago. He wrote:\n\nText:\nIt's been hard without you. I hope you're okay.\n\nEmail: \nIt's been hard without you. I hope you're okay. Sorry for how things went down. \n\nI couldn't respond.",

    "text": "Experienced a ton of sexism and racism in South Korea and need to vent You'd think this was a more appropriate post for the country's sub but, having read so many ~~white men~~ people there apologize for racism, I thought the sexism aspect would at least be appropriate here. **TL:DR at the bottom.**\n\nIt's probably my fault for not reading up on the 'bad' aspects of Korean culture, but I don't know many people who look for those things before visiting a country that has a modern-looking society. Being half Asian the racism and sexism I receive from my mother's homeland is minimal and tolerable. At 5'8\" I stand out. My plain features, brown skin and lankiness draw judgement because 'mixies' are meant to be pale and have more Anglo features. My bad. \n\nAnyway, my stay in Hong Kong and Taiwan was dope. So much to see and so much good food to eat! Shopping was cheaper than back home. Nice. The last leg was South Korea, the source of my mother's beloved K-Dramas and my opportunity to see snow for the first time. What I actually experienced was the opposite of dope. \n\nIt started as I got off of the plane. By far I was the tallest woman there. I stood near the exit and three people approached from behind whispering. I turn around to face my friend and the group glances at me with an audible sigh 'oh, negro'. It was a shock to hear someone refer disdainfully, out loud, to a person as negro. I wondered if they were seeing people who had dark skin or were African (American) around. When there was no person with brown skin other than myself close by I jumped to the conclusion that they might be talking about me and judged based on my features - big lips, booty and wide-ish nose. I dismissed it as me imagining things. \n\nThe next day I was in Meyongdong, a big tourist area, near my hotel. We rushed about and it was packed with stylish people and all the cheap makeup and street food we wanted. As I got bored I tuned in to the crowd around me. So, FYI, the locals LOVE to stare and make comments about foreigners in Hangul, and if they really want to speak their mind a descriptor or two in English as you walk by. By the time I made it back to the hotel I'd been called Japanese (called, not asked) and Chinese and Americano (anyone who can speak English) and... ni**er, once. I saw an African family on a train later with such miserable looks on their faces that I wondered if they were getting the same treatment.  \n\nNow sexism and internalized-mysogyny. Going in I knew Korea has impossibly high beauty standards and I was not exempt from judgement; not that I could hide given I was taller than most people as well as having brown skin. I believe women did not like that I was tall and thin as that is a huge ideal and the vast majority are smaller than 5'8\". Two other girlfriends who were with me have typical Asian height and features and were mostly ignored. Men especially didn't like that I was tall. Contrary to reports, Korean men did not appear any taller to me than other Asian men. So while women laughed as I walked by and grabbed their boyfriends to drag them further away, men got aggressive, like intentional shoves in crowds and 'tch-ing' as they would walk past. Old men turned around after seeing me as I approached. If I stood next to them in a crowd they'd move elsewhere. A kid walked by and called me a giant monster as his parents smirked. It was bewildering how frequent and constant this behavior was. Almost everyone I walked past was laughing or giving dirty looks. Even people some distance away. Christ. By the end of my 2nd day I tired of what was happening and concluded this was top of the range sexism and racism. [I Googled this shit and found that I wasn't alone and the issue is swept under the rug.](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1221602) [Open discrimination is not legislated against and foreigners complaints are dismissed](http://www.koreaobserver.com/nearly-all-foreigners-victim-of-discrimination-in-seoul-29001/). Great. Also found out that speaking English when not white invites scorn for being a snob and 'better' than Koreans, which they mocked me for too. Another layer of bullshit to deal with.\n\nOn the 4th day I had enough and stayed in my hotel. It was great tbh, but my travel companions who had typical Asian appearances thought I was crazy. I was fine with watching action movies all day instead of looking at the ground to try in an attempt to hide myself.\n\nBy the 7th day I was willing to face the music and go on the DMZ tour, which was amazing, then I had dinner and it was back to the bullshit. I decided to go out for the remaining couple of days anyway as I had recharged my spirit staying in the hotel and wanted to see what I could, which was a bad decision. I only remembered Gangnam was the capital of superficiality once I saw all the plastic surgery ads in the train station. Walking around there the laughs were louder and the men yelling 'You're a big girl!' was just enough evidence for my friends to start believing me. \n\nBy the end I was emotionally worn down. I was happy my flight was early morning but the abuse from other Korean travelers continued until I got off the plane in Singapore. The biggest irony was sitting in the departure lounge as a Korean woman walked past with a bag that said 'RACISM' with a cross through it. If I weren't so demoralized I would've laughed. \n\n**TL:DR - Beware of rampant, open, sexism and racism in Korea, and by all means do not be brown, tall and female. People defend Korea's nationalist monoculture and say 'you just have to deal with it' but you'd think there'd at least be some tiny courtesy to keep the racist and sexist comments quieter. Even sadder is that it's being taught to children. I don't hate Korea, it's a beautiful country, but I wish their culture did not foster so much ignorance. For *anyone* visiting there you'll need something tougher than thick skin.**",

    "text": "About to rent apartment from BF's parents but it has turned into a complete circus. Hi, just looking to you guys for any opinion on the matter!       \nSo, moving from SC to NYC and next door to my boyfriends parents who are renting our apartment from the owner. We are paying rent money to his parents as they've paid 6 months in advance to the owner.       \nSC wages are much different than NY, and $2500 a month for a 2 bedroom apartment is astronomical to me. So, naturally, just to protect myself, I wanted to take a look at the rental agreement. I'm actually mentioned in it but never signed anything. It's just business right? Well, the boyfriend's parents are deeply offended and think that if I truly loved/trusted my boyfriend that I should trust them too, and also because I met them one time to judge their character. As far as I'm concerned, they're still strangers to me, I don't know them. They could fuck me over in a heartbeat, who knows?           \nI said that I would not move into the new apartment without getting to see the agreement. So they're taking this very personal and have now said they will not allow me to look over the rental agreement until I present to them 2 forms of ID (license, passport) because, to them, \"If you don't trust us with the lease, we don't trust you either - that you are who you say you are.\" \nI'm completely dumbfounded. Seems petty because they know exactly who I am. Like what could I be, Milli Vanilli? $2500 is a lot of money and I just want to protect myself and know that they're not making money off of me, and just know the legal aspects of all this. Am I missing something and they're being reasonable? What do you guys think?       \nAn Aside: Cultural differences are likely playing a part as well. They are first generation Korean and I'm southern white.",

    "text": "Looking for general career advice from people who have worked abroad. What was it like re-entering the job market in the states? How do employers view candidates with overseas experience not related to the job? Worked in China for about 15 months teaching english to children which was really fun, networked a ton, paid off about half of my student loans, now I am in Korea. Just got hired as a University professor outside of Seoul and would really like to take this year to develop a skill such as becoming fluent in either Chinese or Korean. Mainly because I love communicating with people and I think it would be a beneficial skill to bring back to the states once I decide to return. I mainly came to Korea because my moms family is from Korea and I wanted to learn the language, but I find myself busy with school and I think I would learn the language better if I was enrolled at a Uni! So far, living in Korea isn't really what I expected as far as culture and community. Many Koreans are a bit judge mental and I think Korea has less opportunity than China when it comes to learning a language. I did get an offer at a University in China and the offer is still on the table but the pay is much less, but they did say that I can audit Chinese classes and they will provide me with a working visa. Prior to working abroad I have about year experience working at a PR/Marketing firm doing event coordinating. What jobs can I really look for when I want to come back to the states? I wouldn't want to work in the teaching industry in the US.. Do companies see working abroad as a plus for candidates? I am 26 going on 27, have about $10,000 in student loans and think I think if I stay with the Uni job for a year I can pay off all my student loans by the end of September 2017.",
