    "text": "Is this Career Burnout, or just wanting a Career Change? I have a confusing thoughts about my current job, and I don't know if I should stay or I should try harder to find what I actually want/like to do/my passion. \\*Please be aware that it's going to be long text below since it's more like \"off my chest\" post, so feel free to skip :)\n\nAllow me to explain my background first: I am a foreign female in early 30s living in Japan and just married to a local. Soon I will change to spousal visa from working visa so I think I will have more freedom to choose my own job in the near future. I can speak so-so Japanese, enough for business environment and daily life and also can speak read and write English almost fluently.\n\nI have been through working life for almost 7 years, mainly in sales & mkt field for 5 years in my home country. Here is what I like about current job in Japan which I started 1,5 years ago:\n\n* It's related to electricity/power/energy, the fields that many people call very stable at least in Japan, and my place happen to be part of the biggest energy group in Japan. Being able to be part of this company makes some of my friends and colleagues envious to me. Corona doesn't impact this company at all since the demand for power will always be there forever. Pay and benefits are quite good.\n* I work as business development, which many people think its cool..\n* However my main work mostly utilize my language skill. I am the only one foreigner in this company and it is the first time they hired one. They rely heavily on me to read documents, making summaries, checking somethings in contracts, translations, etc because I am the only who can speak my country's language, English, and Japanese. Some Japs can speak English but honestly, not so well. I like it when I do this kind of work; I feel the sense of achievement and relief when I helped colleagues and customers. I got praised with this and I am motivated by praise and flatteries (though I know its not good to feed on them)\n* Most of the people are nice and fun. I don't see them as workaholics which is the image ppl usually have about working Japs. Although most of the workers are old and never interact with foreigner (very local company) they welcome me so much and I feel comfortable\n* I like the environment; unlike what I heard about other Jap companies, its easy to take leave, you are free to decide WFH schedule, my boss' manager and other higher ups are super nice, even I had fun communicating with CEO. They have many leave system in a year that it is easy to get leaves accumulated. They also have flex time, and good leave system for pregnancy and post-delivery period.\n* Working pace is not so crazy and actually I can say its quite relaxing. No targets. No hard pressure. Senior and boss kindly understand what my capacity is, especially as a foreigner.\n* This is the job where I can speak English to my boss and CEO, and I cant find much of this kind of job currently in Japan. Some vacancy that comes a lot is recruitment firms, and although I am curious about that job I heard many negative thought revolving around the stress and fast paced and competitive environment, which I might appreciate if I am still single. However I don't think that kind of fierce job is suitable for my family oriented life plan\n\nSo many good points that I actually want to explain, but honestly I think so many times that this job is not \"me\". There are too many times I feel unmotivated and don't work at all in whole day. There are many times I imagine myself working other job in other companies. Though I mentioned no stressful pressure in the last point, I have many stressful moments where I have to bring that stress to home, thus somehow it affects my private life (we wanted to have a child soon but somehow it wont do with the work stress and anxiety).\n\nIt might be related to some bad points that I think about the job and the company:\n\n* That I don't feel like I am able to release my stress to other colleague. no matter how nice they are, I am still a non Japanese, and there is always this invisible barrier that don't let me getting close to them and be able to express my worry, fear, what I want etc. The problem not only lies in language differences, the culture and mindset difference has taken a toll of my mental too.\n* As I said, too many old ppl in my company, hence I don't have friends of same age that I can rely to, even just for fun. I feel lonely and more stress with this.\n* Yeah, I get to work on something related to language skills, but actually my main job is supposed to be business development, and yeah it is a cool job, you got to see many new techie startups, talk to them and ask to be partner then sell the tech together, to Japs customers or other countries. But... I don't have the drive to do it somehow. Like, I just don't care about difficult themes and technical biz, how can I offer it to other companies? There are many days where I dont have certain task to do, that time I suposed to search startups biz and new tech and such, actively pursuing new business devs, but I just don't move.. WFH also make it worse since I always get distracted by housewife-y activities that give me more sense of achievement and motivation better.\n* I realized I prefer to have targets and have someone press me on what to do/what to work on, rather than \"please do it your way as long as you bring the result\". I already get used to getting assigned to handle certain products, learn about it, then approach \\[countable\\] customers in a day to achieve \\[countable\\] sales in a month. I don't have this now.\n* I get used to work that require me to move, like doing business trips, visiting clients, entertaining them, interacting with new ppl etc. With corona + the current workflow, it feels so boring and stuck. I mean, I am not even allowed to interact with the customers in my own home country..\n* The company mindset are so old that they don't utilize IT nicely. Hence, when doing WFH, I am happy that there are not much meetings or no moments like my boss are checking me every 5 mins or sth like that, no. But at the same time the motivation become so low and the anxiety of not knowing what others doing is creeping up.\n* No proper training or guidance from higher ups. about business investments etc. I have to learn how to read FS/BS/PL, read legal contracts, etc by myself. Yea, its good that I learn new things for my own development, and I can use it in other field in case I quit this job but.. honestly.. I don't actually care about these energy, new technology blabla things. When I learn things, I don't even know if it is correct or not because nobody can correct me anyway. I feel like jack of all trades, master of none. one day I have to do A task, the next day I have to learn B to do C, and then I was asked to do D so I learn from zero again. It keeps repeating and I see myself as a stupid person who don't remember how to do A B C D etc at all. I cannot find the \"rhythm\" of this job and I feel like always out of place\n* The theme of power, electricity, energy etc is too much for me. everything is too broad. we have to read news everyday about anything also, not to mention most of the materials are in Japanese language. I got overwhelmed easily with difficult words and vocabs.\n* As I mentioned before, not utilizing IT means they still do everything manually, including stamping documents, signatures, approvals, etc. Very old fashioned and might need tens of years to change the system. I cannot stand to wait for that change.\n* All in all, I feel I don't contribute much to this company, feeling stupid and don't know how to do the job, cannot measure what I did and what I can do in the future, and feeling like I receive salary for nothing, most of the time.\n\nIn conclusion, what makes me stay is just because the combination of Corona + slow-paced no-hard-pressure work + not so bad money and benefits.\n\nAre the points above shows I have career burnout? Am I just getting tired of working?\n\nOr should I blame myself because I force myself to work in something I don't have interest to? Is it worth to leave this stable and prestigious company/field to re-start a journey of finding what I love to do? If I consult this to Japanese, they think with my current age my life plan, it is better to just stay and endure, since its not a bad company, rather, a stable company and don't give pressure much. I am posting this here to hear many other opinion, or if any of you have the same experience.",

    "text": "How to complain against boss in small company So I am the lead of the R&D team in a company of 25. I report directly to the second-in-line of the company, whose official title is “Director of Development”. \n\nMy boss is an extreme narcissist who micromanages, doesn’t listen when we say something can’t work and isn’t worth the effort (both true, every time), disrespects everyone, devalues everyone with sly comments, threatens to nullify bonuses etc. \n\nWith only the CEO above him in a small company, I see it as risky to go directly to the CEO, because I feel my boss will somehow lie his way out of my complaints, as he always does. I have a few recorded videos of him straight up leaving calls while people are trying to talk to him, examples of his devaluing comments, and lying that he made decisions that caused everything to break. The worst one shows him being incredibly insensitive (joking) about how my cat got killed by coyotes the day beforehand. \n\nI got a written performance warning from him yesterday. My team and I know that it’s because of his managing.  If I file an complaint, he will definitely put our missed goals against me. The team (whom have been with the company for 4 years, me 7 months) will probably not join the complaint because their culture (Japanese under an American boss) unfortunately is submissive. \n\nMy question is: what should I expect if I file an complaint and speak to the CEO? Should I even do it? My boss is extremely good at sliding by tough situations with his charm. Options are to just bear with him and continue looking for a job, or complain about my boss and start massive turmoil within the company I love. Both options are very stressful, consequences imposed on my fellow coworkers, and involve feelings of loss.\n\nI love this company and the opportunity I’ve been given to make an product that will make an difference in the real world. I don’t want to lose that, but the absurdity of my boss is just too much to bear. Yes, I have had conversations with him regarding his actions, and he does not take responsibility or take steps to change his behavior.\n\nRegardless, I’m grinding leet code and getting ready for interviews, because I legitimately can’t work under this guy.\n\nI guess this turned into more of an venting post…\n\nEdit: CEO is HR btw",
