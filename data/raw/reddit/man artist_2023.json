    "text": "What salary should my non-U.S.-citizen wife with a graduate degree expect? Hi all, \n\nI understand this is a vague question, but I'm hoping for some clarity. \n\nMy wife is from India and has a master's degree in history from a well-respected Indian university. We moved to America several months ago, and she's applying for a variety of positions--some in her field, and some in generic university administration positions. She's made it to final-stage interviews in positions that pay between $30,000 and $90,000 per year. \n\nHowever, she's only received *concrete* offers from jobs that pay between $30,000 and $40,000 per year. \n\nEarlier today, she received an offer for a university administrative position that pays $30,000 per year. It includes full medical benefits and a surprisingly large 403(b) contribution. \n\nWhile she's eager to start working, I'm not sure what our expectations for a \"reasonable\" salary should be. I understand that my wife's foreign credential could pose an initial barrier to entry, but man... I was just in Subway the other day, and I saw that *starting salaries* for \"sandwich artists\" pay more per hour than her current offer. \n\nI get that history degrees aren't exactly in-demand, but it seems like even very, very relevant positions that **require** a master's and are located in high COL areas, like Washington, D.C., only pay between $40,000 and $50,000. \n\nWe're sort of considering just taking this offer, since my wife's probably just going to go back to school next year to get a second master's. I just feel like she's underselling herself, given that fast food restaurants pay more per hour. \n\nAny thoughts or advice would be appreciated.",

    "text": "I interviewed a bunch of incels as part of a film I'm making with a women's art collective I'm part of a collective of women collaborating on an artistic project about the attitudes of men and women towards sex. As part of this project I've interviewed a number of self-confessed incels. As a sexually liberated feminist, these interviews were tough! I'm both disgusted and terrified by the incel ideology, but the aim of these conversations was to explore these men's attitude towards women, and withholding judgement and dispute was necessary to create an environment where these men felt able to open up and give honest answers.\n\nFrom these interviews we've uncovered what we believe is a cycle that shows how young men are corrupted into the incel ideology. I thought some of you may be interested in hearing it, and I'd really welcome any thoughts from your own experiences that either support or challenge this theory.\n\nEach man I spoke with was obsessed with physical appearance. They strongly believed women would **only** seek a relationship with men who are attractive or successful, ideally both. When I suggested this was an inaccurate stereotype of 3 billion unique individuals these men all defended the idea with phrases like \"I've seen it happen many times,\" and \"that's been my experience.\"\n\nThey all claimed they only see women with \"attractive\" men. My theory here is \"I've seen it\" actually means \"it's what I've read on the internet.\" If you walk through any public space you will see a diverse range of couples so the idea that women will only date \"attractive men\" is rubbish.\n\nMy next challenge was to try to understand why these men choose to believe what they read online over what they see in real life. The simple answer is it's easier to blame others than taking responsibility for yourself. I asked these men how they thought their lives would be different if they were \"attractive.\" I received a few different replies but the majority were variations on the idea that people would treat them better and they would feel more accepted and therefore \"naturally come away with a better personality.\" So essentially their personality would be better if people treated them better. This was one of many examples of how these men place the blame for their own shortcomings on women. And when I pointed this out I received the reply  \"you cannot separate yourself from the effects of others.\" The belief was their personality and \"worth\" are completely defined by others, namely women, and they have no control over this.\n\nI then asked what non-physical qualities they have that they think women might be interested in. This question was mainly dodged by saying something like \"I can't read women's minds.\" So I flipped the question to ask what non-physical attributes they look for in a women? Not a single one of these men gave a serious answer to this question. And this is where everything started to make sense in my mind.\n\nThese men see women as objects, and therefore become obsessed with \"attractiveness.\" This makes them feel physically inadequate. Because they believe \"attractiveness\" is outside of their control they blame \"shallow women\" for their inability to find a partner. And then we're back to the beginning, his resentment of women reinforces their objectification of women. The cycle repeats and they fall deeper into inceldom.\n\nThese conversations were quite scary to conduct, and it's worrying how easily someone can fall into this kind of echo-chamber, and how normalised it has become with \"influencers\" like Andrew Tate becoming more mainstream. But what pissed me off more than anything is the \"I've seen it\" defence. These men are lying to themselves because it's easier for them to believe everyone else is the problem rather than taking actions to improve their own lives. They repeatedly claimed to have no control over their own life, whereas they are actually the cause of their own problems.\n\nThe findings from these interviews are going to be used in a film we're making as part of an art installation. I've only touched on a small sample of what we uncovered so I'd be happy to answer any questions anyone has on these interviews, and I'd really like to know if what we've uncovered so far fits in with other people's experiences.\n\nEDIT: Rather than responding to all the individual questions about the project, it's going to be an online exhibition touching on different subjects relating to the influences behind people's attitudes towards sex, touching on subjects like inceldom, kink, BDSM, pornography and feminist sexual liberation. It won't be out until next year but I will post about it once it's done. Thanks so much for the support!",

    "text": "Tattoo Artist Wont Leave Me and My Friend Alone I got this trashy tattoo on my hips back when I was 18 that says “Your Name” a la Steve-O from Jackass. After a recent assault it was much less funny, and my mom paid for me to get it covered. The guy I usually go to was booked that day so I went to the shop’s “visiting artist” who I’m going to call Todd. Todd only wore short shorts for both appts (this isn’t important but I want you all to know anyways). \n\nThese tattoos are HIGH on my hips, basically on my crotch. I had to wear a thong and no pants to get them done as regular underwear covered the area getting tattooed.\n\nSo I’m not new to getting tattooed but these were incredibly painful. Any time I would yell out “motherf*cker” or “f*ck” he would respond with “aw how did you know my name” or other borderline demeaning comments. When I came in for day two of the tattoos he goes “well aren’t you a little masochist”. I understand this is tattoo culture to be edgy but man did it feel uncomfortable and demeaning. Not to mention the entire time he’s tattooing my tattoos his hand is directly on top of my crotch, which again, benefit of the doubt, could be necessary, but was still super uncomfortable. \n\nFast forward to now. I tell my best friend about it and turns out he’s been harassing them over instagram. Both harassing them in the dm’s asking when they are going to start getting a tattoo from him and commenting stuff like “you look fire” or “hot” with fire emojis. Once again, Todd is at it making us uncomfortable. \n\nI just don’t get it. Is he just bad at boundaries? We are both afab nb and dress more feminine but is that why he just goes unchecked? I will add in his benefit one of his girlfriends is there as his apprentice watching the ENTIRE time and that helped a bit but without her I would have left before he finished the first tattoo.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add! He also had me stand on the street, pantsless, for a video of my tattoos (crotch) so he could have “natural lighting”.",

    "text": "I’m so sick of people saying women have a low pain tolerance It’s a known issue that medical professionals and physicians often ignore women’s pain and dismiss it as hysteria.\n\n[We aren’t treated the same way men are, in that a man can go to the ER and has a much better chance that people listen him.](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/women-and-pain-disparities-in-experience-and-treatment-2017100912562)\n\nWe live in a world where men get Vicodin for vasectomies and women get whatever OTC meds for childbirth, even if their is tearing or in some cases when she actually has a C-section.\n\nSo how are you gonna tell me that culturally, the gender that is taught to both ignore and deal with pain solo is some how worse at dealing with it then the gender that get legit narcotics for a simple out patient procedure? Maybe they feel less pain because of all of those prescription narcotics their given?\n\nAs a researcher, I try to be unbiased but [there is a long history regarding medical bias against women and how are pain is ignore](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-there-a-gender-bias-against-female-pain-patients_b_589b6b3ee4b061551b3e06ab/amp)\n\nSo how am I supposed to believe studies that come from that same biased community about how we as women have both a lower tolerance to pain but also experience higher levels of it for the same things?\n\nMaybe those doctors need to interview some tattoo artists or something, because they seem like the only group of people who understand that when you put both a man and a women under the same stimuli, one group is more likely to fall asleep and the other can’t seem to sit still because they claim it hurts so much.\n\nMaybe it’s that as a women, pain is life. It starts when we’re in our early teens and continues for the rest of it. Which we know pain is both subjective and  exposure and range both breeds tolerance. So if it the fact that we experience more pain that make people think we are some how are less tolerant of it? Is that the logic?\n\nMake that make sense. \n\nI have suffered from chronic pain several times in my life, I had endometriosis that took ten years to treat because no one believed me. Maybe they just lacked the references for what nerve damage due to unchecked tissue growth does to a person?\n\nMy partner was hit by a car and it permanently fucked up his spine, causing mass nerve pain. While it’s been surgically repaired, to this day, he seems to be the only guy I’ve ever met that gets my pain, understands it and recognizes it’s severity. While other people I’ve been with have described kidney stones or tooth aches as ‘the worst pain imaginable’, I wish that was the case for me. \n\nPain touches so many spaces for us in ways that men will never experience it. Seriously, thank about it. A man would never power through painful sex, if men got pregnant, abortion would be free, if men had periods Vicodin would like be a standard treatment for cramps.\n\nDo men just not have a frame of reference? \n\nIt just seems to be that this whole stance of women being less tolerant to pain isn’t even about pain but about people acting like we are weak without proof or a reference what it actually feels like to live in a female body. \n\nWhat are they trying to prove aside for finding more ways to ignore our experiences?\n\nIt’s just one more dig at us, when some days that all life seems to be, more attacks and more micro aggressions without any empathy or understanding.\n\nIt’s just really hard not to feel exhausted by all of it.\n\nEdit:\nThanks you for all for sharing your experience! It’s really heartbreaking to see how many of you have had similar experiences, it shows how much we need real change in how doctors are allowed to treat us.\n\nTo the few who ask ‘Who’s saying that?’ \nA simple search will turn up a bunch of studies that say just that. \n\nFor every one that finds women have higher pain tolerance, their are 4-5 that cite the opposite, often citing data sources that can’t provide an accurate representation of our actual experiences. At the end of the day, these studies lack any real clinical value as they do nothing to improve care or treatment of pain.\n\nFrom a behavioral standpoint pain is too varied and subjective for a single sentence conclusion. \n\nThis post is more about what people do with that information, specifically doctors, the quality of care women receive due to this inherent bias that we’re ‘faking it’ or anxious. It’s a rant. It was for everyone else who has ever felt helpless in a medical setting.",

It just shows how even as children, the innocence, talents, dreams, ambitions of young girls is shunted aside for their bodies. This story broke in 2018, and I don't feel it got as much attention at the time as it should have. Someone mentioned it in regards to the current events around Justin Roiland, and rereading it this time it really hit me. \n\nThis is a man who made a children's cartoon that was iconic to many in the 1990s. Who many looked up to. And continued to have influence in the industry long after these events. And is still admired to this day. \n\nIt really shows how some men have no respect for the innocence, dreams, ambitions of little girls. She was just 13 years old when she wrote to him about her dreams of being a cartoonist, and he just exploited that to make her his \"girlfriend\". He looked at these amazing young women as if they were just blow up dolls from his [cartoon fantasies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ria8fqPqZe8). \n\nhttps://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/arianelange/john-kricfalusi-ren-stimpy-underage-sexual-abuse\n\nSome quotes that stood out to me, which haven't gotten the attention they deserve-\n\n\"Robyn Byrd thought her plan was working when the letter from her hero arrived in the mail. It was 1994, and the 13-year-old had sent the creator of The Ren & Stimpy Show a video of herself talking about her drawings and the animation career she envisioned; she thought if she got the attention of the studio behind the hit Nickelodeon show, she might get a job there someday. John Kricfalusi’s effusive letter, Byrd said, seemed like the first step toward her dream.\n\nShe could hardly believe he’d responded. “I had built up these characters and this mythos of Ren & Stimpy in my head,” Byrd, now 37, told BuzzFeed News. “It was exciting.”\n\nSoon, she said, she began receiving boxes of toys and art supplies from 39-year-old Kricfalusi, better known as John K. He helped her get her first AOL account, through which he convinced her he could help her become a great artist. He visited her at the trailer park where she lived in Tucson, Arizona. “I thought I was still his little cute friend,” she said. And then, when she was still in 11th grade, he flew her to Los Angeles to show her his studio and talk about her future. She said that on the same trip, in a room with a sliding glass door that led to his pool, he touched her genitals through her pajamas as she lay frozen on a blanket he’d placed on the floor. She was 16.\"\n\n> Rice said she finally did leave after two incidents that happened in relatively close succession: The first was his half-threat of rape during the Weird Al job, and then, she said, she found child porn on his computer. Rice said she found images of girls she didn’t recognize, naked; she remembered one photo in particular, with a naked girl who appeared to be around 10 years old, lying on her back with her legs spread and an expression on her face that Rice described as fearful. An ex-girlfriend of Kricfalusi’s, who asked not to be named in this story, said she, too, saw naked images of prepubescent girls who appeared to be between 12 and 14 on his personal computer around 2007.",

    "text": "102 Books; or, The Problem With Binary Thinking *Please let me preface this text with a note that I don't think any hobbies or traits are inherently \"manly\" or \"girly\", or that reading is somehow superior to other ways to spend time. I'm just unpacking the opinions I held in the past, and what I thought people were thinking about me.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**First, there was the \"Not like other girls\" phase.**  \nI was twelve, and it was thankfully short-lived. I didn't like stereotypically \"girly\" stuff like shopping and makeup, and read heaps of books and liked to study; that made me better than other girls, right? (Spoiler: no it did not. Man, that internalised misogyny is a bitch)  \nI was praised for reading all the time. \n\n**Next, there was the \"Why am I not like other girls??\" phase.**  \nI was thirteen to fifteen, and stressed. WHY didn't I like shopping, WHY did I hate makeup? Why did I prefer books and video games to makeovers and skirts? Was something wrong with me? Was I too boyish for the girls?   \nTo a teenager, every tiny uniqueness feels like a chasm of different and weird, yawning between you and your peers, and I was very aware of my differences.   \nFunnily enough, I was so focussed on the differences that I didn't notice the sameness. I loved sleepovers, and chick flicks, and talking about our crushes.   \nI was mocked for reading all the time.\n\n**Then came the phase I like to call \"Pick Me Lite\".**  \nI was sixteen to eighteen. I hung out mostly with boys. This was not because I looked down on other women, but because I feared I didn't fit in. Hanging out with boys was easier, because I could enjoy my more \"masculine\" traits. We played video games, and drank rum, and watched Marvel movies.  \nThis was almost a positive approach, but I began to actively hide other parts of myself, so I wasn't now too girly for the boys. I was starting to dabble in makeup, I abhorred watching fights or violence of any kind, I actually kinda liked the colour pink. I had a taste for cheesy romance movies and fanfiction that the CIA themselves couldn't have gotten out of me. I loved fruity little drinks. But I hid it all.   \nI stopped reading.\n\n**Next, I became the \"Cool Girl\".**   \nI was nineteen to twenty three. I was actually being a lot more comfortable in myself overall. I studied to become a makeup artist, finding a sneaky passion there that I hadn't known I had. I started working in a female dominated workplace, surrounded by cosmetics and skincare and girly drama. I loved it. I bought more pink stuff, started decorating my apartment, wearing makeup daily. I dyed my hair blonde, got called Barbie, and loved that too. I learned that I AM like other girls, and was grateful.  \nI still had mostly male friends, but that was because most of my friends were from the gym and there weren't many women there.   \nI met my now-husband at this time. He was (and still is) a total dreamboat. I wanted to be perfect for him. For two years, he never once saw me without makeup. I looked good, but was \"low maintenance\" - at least, as far as he knew. I never complained. I'd come over, eagerly watch him play Call of Duty for hours, have sex, then go home. I never mentioned my hobbies, except where they aligned with his. I pretended I liked things he liked, and pretended I didn't like things he didn't like. I bought the same games as him, and hung out with his friends and played those games too. I went to watch UFC fights with him, trying not to look as someone caved in another person's nose in front of me.   \nI went to university. I was too busy to read.\n\n**And now, I am just Bree.**   \nI am still a work in progress.   \nI like video games, but not shooty ones. I like hanging out with my husband's friends, but not playing Warhammer for hours on end. I drink rum sometimes, and fruity cocktails other times.   \nI'm a girl's girl, a tomboy, masculine, feminine; all the labels and none of them. I love people who embrace their labels, and I love people who eschew them altogether.  \nMy favourite comfort movies are Barbie & The Nutcracker, and Iron Man.   \nI still watch my husband play games for hours, but only when I want to.   \nWe went to watch the UFC fight on Sunday. I dressed in my prettiest dress, took off my glasses so I couldn't see the screen, and read my book the whole time while enjoying the conversation.   \nAnd I didn't care what anyone thought of that decision!  \nI have read 102 books in the last year. And I am so happy.",

    "text": "I have resources, support, and I still feel powerless. !!! CONTENT WARNING: drugging and abuse !!!\n\nHello, femmes, themmes, and everyone else:\n\nIn December 2022, I was drugged at a bar by a prominent local creative.\n\nThe story begins almost 6 months earlier. I had begun a purely sexual relationship with this person after knowing them for a long time before. We had a lot of similar interests and connected well. There was a lot of sexual tension and I always wondered what might have been.\n\nFastforward to May 2022. I run into him at the local pool, and we instantly reconnected. We had sex that day and began a fling. We had a summer of spending a lot of time together, but I kind of knew it wasn’t heading anywhere good and that he was fucking me around. I couldn’t pull myself from it even though I knew it was happening because I have very deep set boundary issues in sexual relationships that I am still working through.\n\nI met my trans girlfriend, Michelle, in September of 2022, when I was actually out with this man at a bar. Michelle and I instantly had a great connection, but I wasn’t looking for anything specific.\n\nA few twists and turns and Michelle and I are together, spending almost every day together, falling deeply in love. I stopped talking to this man almost instantly… Michelle told me he was bad news, and it didn’t really fully hit me until she said it. I stopped contacting him, seeing him, and halfheartedly returned his messages when he texted me.\n\nFastforward to December of 2022. I was invited to a bar holiday party by a friend of mine. I knew he was going to be there, but at the time, I had no reason to be concerned by that. My friend was very tired and left the party early. I was having fun getting to know the people who were there.\n\nI can’t recall what he said verbatim, but once she left, he said something to the effect of, “Now I have you all to myself.” We were talking and drinking. He told me he loved me and missed me, and he wanted to spend time with me. I drank a few more drinks, danced with some people at the party, and I suddenly felt off. The man had left without saying anything.\n\nI called Michelle and told her I was walking to her apartment because it was close. I stumbled out of the bar, I saw her face, and I don’t remember anything after that. We both recall someone yelling out my name before everything went black. Michelle carried me up to her apartment and I collapsed on the floor.\n\nThe next morning, I felt the worst I’d ever felt, and I got a text from this man. He asked me if I made it home okay. I told him I was fine and I was just hungover. He never texted me back after that.\n\nMichelle told me something wasn’t right and I knew it too. I went and took a drug test. Both screens were positive for benzos. Someone who told me they loved me and missed me *fucking drugged me*.\n\nHe didn’t try to rape me as far as I know, and I don’t like going to police as a personal practice. This person is a prominent local artist, and he is very well liked in my friend group. I have resources. I have people who believe me.\n\nBut he knows where I live. I am looking for a different place to live so I can share my truth and move on from this. My fear of him attacking me is paralyzing me and controlling my life months later. I buried my head and focused on my career because my lack of feeling safe made it impossible to be out and about. \n\nMotherfucker checked to make sure I was alive because he knows he could have killed me.\n\nThank you for reading. Love and light to everyone everywhere.\n\n—E (she/they)",

    "text": "Friendship has become volatile, clueless on how to end it I (23F) have had a best friend (31F) for about 5 years now, but recent events have left other friends of mine to tell me to take a break and/or distance myself and absolve our friendship. I have no idea how to begin.\n\nTo preface this, when I was 14-18 I was in an abusive relationship with a man 10 years my senior and took the punches for years until a friend stepped in. It's affected my ability to trust people and gave me a lot of baggage I've worked out through therapy, medication and aging. I never thought I'd be in a situation like this again.\n\nFor 4 years our friendship was fantastic, but suddenly this year things took a turn. I'm not going to pretend I'm perfect, because I'm sure she knows I complain about her behind her back, but enough has happened in the past 6 months that has made me very uncomfortable even getting texts from her.\n\nThe smallest thing that gets on my nerves is that she is VERY opinionated, in that things are black and white with little wiggle room. She constantly yucks your yum. It's been embarrassing at times being in public and people staring at us because she's shouting about how some TV show is terrible and here's why. My friend group has learned to say \"it's not that big of a deal\" but she quite literally huffs and grumbles if you say that. It's also just not appropriate. There's things I enjoy she'll tell me to my face suck, and I'll tell her I understand, but she'll come back with some crazy, minute reason why she won't give it a chance.\n\nA larger issue, she does not respect boundaries. This is one I can recognize as being an issue. I'm very vocal about what I will and will not do, and it's constantly ignored. She has done things such as inviting herself over to my house without my say in it, \"joked\" about bringing her cats over to my house (I own birds), talked to me about interests I told her I do not want to talk about because she's been trying to get closer to me by getting into them, asking me to drive her to an event for work for the weekend the day before the trip, etc. Arguably the worst one was that I have had a bout of terrible health lately. I caught COVID and recently got a stomach ulcer (due to stress from her) and both she dismissed as \"not that bad.\" I had her drive me to the ER when my ovarian cyst ruptured and when the doctor asked how I was feeling she answered for me, saying \"I've had one before, they're not that bad.\" I was appalled. \n\nShe's vocal about things that are wrong with me and how what I do affects her feelings. I had to delete a social media account because she said it was getting on her nerves, but hers was fine. She's told me to my face I repeat the same stories. I have PTSD and we don't go anywhere, how am I supposed to formulate or remember what I've said? She will openly give unsolicited advice but not accept anything I say as being helpful, I'm guessing because I'm younger. I bought a house this year and it's my fault I went in over my head with it, but she's upset at the prospect i may move and had offered me to take money from her mother (hell no). She also dropped on me that her older sister needs somewhere to live, which I declined to rent out my extra room to her as my house is my sanctuary and I'm not getting involved in her family drama, and I can tell she resents me for it. For Christmas this year our other friends and I are financially struggling so we set a budget of $50. She got upset because she started buying things back in July and told me she \"already spent $90 on one gift for me,\" which was insane. The cheapest thing she gave us to buy was $30. I begrudgingly bought her some small trinkets past the budget but haven't given it to her yet, because she \"wants to unwrap (the gifts) in person to see my reaction.\"\n\nThe icing on the cake is that I gave her a heavily discounted commission through work. She's never done this for me, we're both artists, but my work costs more. Long story short she took advantage of me and gave me a project that would take months to complete while putting me physically out of commission for another couple months, all with zero pay. I refunded her for this a few days ago, putting my foot down. She was not very understanding and kept backpedaling, as if I'd take it if she tweaked the project.\nThat all said.... She takes advantage of our friend group. For years they've been providing her with free labor at events selling her merchandise. She has not paid any of us once. She has a friend who she pays to do online orders for her, but when I mentioned to her that she should pay us, she changed the subject. \n\nIt feels really foreign to me to end a friendship like this and I guess that why I'm making this post, I'm looking to see if anyone else has advice or can relate. You'd think going through something like this before I'd know what to do but it's upsetting all the same. My family loves her and she's in my local friend group, I could care less if they want to stay with her, but it's become too much for me and I don't know how to eloquently end things.",

    "text": "💚 Thank you, teachers. I succeeded in life because of you. 💚 To the many unsung, overworked, and unjustly treated teachers on this sub I just want to say: thank you so very much for all that you do. What you do matters, and I know teachers *know* that, but sometimes it’s still nice to hear.\n\nI want to share my story of how teachers dredged me out of the depths of Nowhereville and made me the (by my own measure, at least) successful adult I am today.\n\nI’ve tried to reach out to some of my past teachers, but many of them, at this point, have left the profession, or passed away. I cannot thank them personally, but want to sing their praises and thank you in their stead, because there are kids you work with today that will think of you the way I do my teachers decades later.\n\nI was born to a teen mom, mostly raised by my grandparents until my mother married my stepfather when I was 5 and we moved in with him. He was violent, physically and verbally abusive, and we were very, very poor. I was a little mousey nothing of a nobody. We moved a lot, and I was shuffled between schools early on. As a result, I had few friends, was self-conscious about our ill-fitting clothes and rusty cars, and just did my best not to be noticed.\n\nBut my teachers noticed me anyway and didn’t let me fall into what could have easily been another loop in the teen-pregnancy stuck in the same small town in Nowhereville saga.\n\nMrs E was my first grade teacher—the woman who handed me the keys to the world. She taught me to *read*. I could struggle along and was placed in the average group when I landed in her school after another move, but she saw something with me, spent extra time with me, and something just clicked with how she mentored me. Because of her, I was not only promoted to the highest tier reading group, but (much more importantly) became a lifelong voracious reader and eventually an author. Without reading as an escape from my early life, I don’t know if I’d still be here at all.\n\nMrs B was my fourth grade and talented & gifted teacher through 8th grade—she was passionate about the environment, would take us on hikes and we’d pick up trash as we went, teaching us to leave the world better than we found it. She also picked up on the fact that while I was a voracious reader, well, we were poor and almost all my books came from garage sales. She found me reading *Needful Things* (yes the one by Stephen King) in class and was (probably rightly) mortified at my choice of books at age 10, but impressed that my reading comprehension was already that high. She took the extra time to find me books that were more age-appropriate but still captivating and challenging for me to read.\n\nMr M was my history teacher in high school, and he stocked shelves at Kmart at night. He was kind, unabashed about his second job (before then I didn’t know how common it was for teachers to have second jobs), and unjudging. By this point I was a little goth girl, but he never treated me like I was a problem kid for how I dressed. (I was such a good kid, no drugs, no drinking, great grades, extracurricular stuff, but a LOT of people treated me badly for how I dressed—which was a side effect of poverty. I couldn’t afford expensive designer clothes so I didn’t even try to play that game and dressed in way to reject it. Which, oddly, paid off later as turns out that becoming goth at 13 pays big dividends to your skin when you’re middle-aged, and taught me that it’s *okay* to be different.) We didn’t have the money for me to sit for the AP History test, but he told me I’d qualified for a special scholarship and that the cost of the test was covered. Years later I learned that blessed man paid for the fee out of his own pocket for me. I passed and got my very first college credits because of him.\n\nMs K was my high school art teacher and I practically lived in her classroom for 4 years. Every studyhall, every class I could get out of early I would, and I’d be back in her room (on top of the multiple art classes I took). She taught me ceramics, stained glass, art metals, airbrushing, and she *pushed* me. I was smart enough and artistically talented enough to fall into the trap of not having to try too hard for a lot of things, but she challenged me to work harder, fail, and then recover from those failures and do better. She knew, without ever asking or tipping her hand too much, that my home life was awful and we didn’t have enough food. Since I got to school so early just to be anywhere but home, she always had an ‘extra’ muffin and coffee waiting for me when I got in to unload the kiln first thing in the morning. She looked the other way when I’d cut out of studyhalls to go to work early (because I was determined to go to college and started working and saving at 13 to be able to do so).\n\nAfter all that, on the brink of going to college, it nearly all came apart at the seams. My applications were coming back rejected: my name didn’t match my SSN. I had no idea my stepfather had refused to adopt me, but after one school shift or another, my mom started using his last name as mine so we’d ‘seem like more of a family.’ NONE of my school records from 3rd grade on were attached to a legal last name. The wonderful women in the school career office worked with me for weeks to get it sorted, and get me a new legal ID with the last name that matched my SSN. At the last possible second I was able to get my applications back out, and was accepted to my school of choice.\n\nWhen I graduated, I all but fled that shitty, dying town and never looked back. I did go to college, the first female in my family to do so, and paid my own way with money I’d saved (which seemed like so much but was gone in a semester), loans, and working 2-3 part time jobs in addition to a full class load. I graduated, another first in my family.\n\nI’ve gone on to start my own business, become a fantasy author, marry a fantastic spouse, and I live a stable, happy life. We’re not rich, but we’re doing more than all right.\n\nIf not for all my teachers, but especially these four, I know in my heart of hearts I’d still be in that crappy dead-end town, probably the wife of someone else that never left, shackled by debt and a litter of unplanned children.\n\nInstead, I am childfree by choice (thank goodness for comprehensive sex ed in my schools) and a *vehement* supporter of public education. I vote for every property tax increase that will better fund our schools, write letters to officials to support policies that support teachers, and if I didn’t think that a childfree person wouldn’t get a side-eye, would run to be on the school board ( do at least research and vote against the right-wing nutters trying to take over the local school board, so far, they have all failed to earn a seat).\n\n[There's a story about a child, and old man, and beach full of stranded starfish that I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with](https://www.thestarfishchange.org/starfish-tale), and in a lot of ways I feel like one of those starfish tossed back into the sea by my teachers.\n\nI wish there were more words for the gratitude I feel, I write for a living, but all I can circle back to is *thank you.*  It does not lessen the indignities you face, the challenges heaped upon you, or the appallingly stingy wages you are paid, but I hope this post is a small ray of sunshine for you on a bleak day.\n\nThank you, teachers, for seeing students like me that try their best to be invisible, for giving a shit when nobody else does, and for literally altering the entire trajectory of my life with you time, attention, and kindness.\n\nThank you, thank you, a million times, thank you. What you do matters *so much*. 💚",

I have been working in costume design in NYC for 10 years, mostly doing assistant/associate work in ballet, opera, and theater, both at the national level and abroad.

Hi guys, for context: I'm a very introverted man, it's not that I can't socialize but I don't interact much so I never got to develop my negotiation skills. I'm also a highly skilled artist for games and I've only ever been in one company for a long time and have racked up more than enough titles and skills under my belt. I also was able to double my pay incomparison to my starting pay in the same company ever since I started which was less than 4 years ago.\n\nHowever I'm at a point now where the competition is getting a bit ugly. I'm not an obsequious person so a lot of my contributions and impact can easily be and have been brushed off. I don't like the brown nosing game, I despise it. In comparison to my peers my skillsets are way higher but again, I'm not rubbing elbows with anybody because I'm a faulty old fashioned guy who thinks honest work is what matters.\n\nBecause of this I decided I just want to switch jobs instead of forcing my way through a sluggish dramafest of who deserves what.

    "text": "Good job, but no upward mobility? Would you leave a good job if it meant you could (pprobably) advance your career?\n\n\nI checked the rules to be sure this is allowed but for transparency, I am posting for my partener who does not use reddit. I'm just an artist so please excuse my overuse of laymen's terms.\n\n\nMy partner is an electrical engineer with a relatively good job, which he's had for years. Small company that can't pay what he's worth, BUT he gets work he mostly enjoys and absolutely adores most of his coworkers, besides a few bad apples. Sub-par pay for what he does, like I said, but great benefits. That, and his boss freaking LOVES him. \n\n\nHis biggest issue with this company is that there's nowhere to go within it. His current title would likely be his title for a decade or longer because of how to tiny this company is, there's just no need for more tiers of management. One man manages the whole EE department AND works on the same projects they are working on. There's just nothing to promote him *to.*\n\n\nHis smaller (but still important to him) issue is that the work is kind of... I'd say adjacent to what he really wants to do. He DOES like his specific niche and he's good at it, but it's not what he invisions himself doing. The other day, one of his coworkers on the shop floor had asked him if his work was difficult. He said \"probably,\" and his coworker elaborated \"is it difficult FOR YOU?\" My partner's immediate answer was \"no\" and this made him so sad.\n\n\nHe has been tossing around the idea of looking around for a out a year now, but whenever a project he's interested in comes along he tossed that aside and goes all in on that until he realizes this one's just the same as it always is, and he becomes unhappy again. \n\n\nI told him I've heard that people who make a lot of good advancement in their careers usually do it by leaving their job every 2-5 years, and using their experience to make their resume look nice and land a better position, rather than working up to one in a company that's not promoting. I've also told him that he doesn't need to be thankful that things aren't worse, and it's okay to want better for yourself. Yes, it is a very decent job, especially in this economic climate, but there is no harm in looking around and maybe finding something better, that can pay him fairly, that makes him happier. He doesn't have to quit to do that!\n\n\nWe just aren't sure that it's the right choice, staying or leaving. We both struggle with big changes and as a freelancer, I really don't know much about advancing within a company, or within your career, to be confident with the advice he's looking for. So, career men and women of Reddit, would YOU be willing to take a blind step into a new job not knowing if it will truly be better? Or should we hold on to the good thing we have and hope things change?",

How would work is he would say God sees us together,  and then try to hit on them. He’s in would female security guards, make fun of me for my celebrity palsy then when I club back at him one day, he said there was pig guts in the trashcan. I was like I didn’t know anybody invited your mom to the party, 😂😂😂😂 he’s been reported me without telling them what he said anyway point is he harassed one of the coworkers girlfriends the coworker, took it all the way to human resources and got the dude fired. I stood up for him by screaming in that dude’s face, because he had reported me falsely for smoking weed in the bathroom, now that you have contacts for me in this coworkers friendship, things are gonna get interesting well a couple months go by and this coworker is now my friend, we got into an argument about Eminem being the best rapper I said he wasn’t in there are rappers better than him, and that apparently set him off enough to corner me, and threaten to beat the shit out of me. He is very artistic, a couple weeks go by and he actually hits me for real the  discussion was about AI taking over the world, I of  course become very frightened. They sent him home for two days, while things go back to normal, we start to talk again and I thought everything was OK. Fast forward a couple of weeks ago. We are alone.

I try not to say much to him, but I had blocked his number, thinking that he had been fired and unblocked his number because I am afraid that if he finds out I blocked his number he will beat me up again, anyway, fast forward to Thursday of this week, again, I’m still sick, but I need the money so I come back and at the end of the shift the very end, my boss says will be giving you Friday off every week from now on until further notice because you’ve missed four Fridays in a row, despite the fact that we were off for Thanksgiving and I missed that Friday because we were off, I am just baffled. It is not OK to miss four Fridays in a row because you are sick and dealing with an illness but it is OK to hit somebody and you won’t lose your job for it, what should I do?",

Hi all,\r  \n\r  \nI understand this is a vague question, but I'm hoping for some clarity.\r  \n\r  \nMy wife is from India and has a master's degree in history from a well-respected Indian university. We moved to America several months ago, and she's applying for a variety of positions--some in her field, and some in generic university administration positions. She's made it to final-stage interviews in positions that pay between $30,000 and $90,000 per year.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, she's only received *concrete* offers from jobs that pay between $30,000 and $40,000 per year.\r  \n\r  \nEarlier today, for instance, she received an offer for a university administrative position that pays $30,000 per year. It includes full medical benefits and a surprisingly large 403(b) contribution.\r  \n\r  \nWhile she's eager to start working, I'm not sure what our expectations for a \"reasonable\" salary should be. I understand that my wife's foreign credential could pose an initial barrier to entry, but man... I was just in Subway the other day, and I saw that starting salaries for \"sandwich artists\" pay more per hour than her current offer.\r  \n\r  \nI get that history degrees aren't exactly in-demand, but it seems like even very, very relevant positions that require a master's and are located in high COL areas, like Washington, D.C., only pay between $40,000 and $50,000.\r  \n\r  \nWe're sort of considering just taking this offer, since my wife's probably just going to go back to school next year to get a second master's. I just feel like she's underselling herself, given that fast food restaurants pay more per hour.\r  \n\r  \nAny thoughts or advice would be appreciated.",

    "text": "Am I overreacting? Or are my concerns valid? (production artist) Hey everyone, I am a full time illustrator who works with many different clients. My main client brought me on full time this past year (woo hoo!) to work on our microbusiness... however I lately have just been feeling like I've been going crazy.\n\nI know I am working on my own end about time management, I work from home and as an Illustrator, sometimes one has weird work hours. But, lately I'm just not sure if my concerns I've expressed to my boss are valid or just more related to me trying to be better at time management in my own life?\n\nWe are working on a book which I personally thought we should have had done back in the summer. We went back to the drawing board a few times since boss wasn't quite sure what he wanted. Again, I'm full time with him, so he can use my time and skills however he wants. This caused some tension since we kept going back and forth which halted a lot of the process. I also think he wasn't getting the correct answers I needed from the printer in order to get the documents ready for print. So this lead to more fixing and waiting for him to get back to me. (He's got another job so it's not always perfect on time). It was so much of me explaining that we need to work on the full book and not keep fussing about the size of margins. (Easily spent a month staring at a blank page where \"AD GOES HERE\" was written on the document...)\n\nNone the less, we got the book done. YAY. Printer had one edit and we got it sent off a couple weeks ago before the end of the year. Double yay! Now the next step of any book project/brand especially at the beginning of the year is to start just looking ahead. Do we want to hit the holiday season? Summer? How will we have a book launch? Soft launch? Major count down? Etc?\n\nWe've already been flexible throughout the entire project so far and he says his goal is to make money, so having these deadlines are a sure fire way to make sure that we get things done!\n\nEnd of the year comes and goes, I ask back once the work week starts what we're doing... his response is that we're just going to take one day at a time. Again, one day at a time is great and all, but we have a literal PRODUCT coming to us (which he tells me is actually going to be here by the end of Feb). Sweet! This means we can take product photos, get working on marketing, etc. I keep asking him are you wanting to hit the Holiday market? His response is that he doesn't want to think about future stuff.... just focus on getting money.\n\nBoss man... I tell him... in order to make money, we need to now think about how we're going to sell our product. Our website is unfinished, our side products on the website aren't finished or represent what we've been doing lately, and above all... this is an art project aimed at families! Do we want some animated gifs for the product to help promote? Animation alone takes time along with our other stuff I have to work on weekly.\n\nDon't worry about it.\n\nI just am sitting here another week going surprise pikachu face. Like, artists work to the speed of deadlines, so I feel bad when we don't hit our \"lets take it as it goes\" deadlines.\n\nWe used to post our artwork online too, but now we're not even doing that... it's pretty much I'm creating work that I *can't* really talk about online or show people cuz it's pretty much being constantly worked on. \n\nI guess part of my frustration and wondering if I'm going crazy is that, this is literally my job. I went to school for this. I have a freelance business. I've been doing illustration professionally for nearly a decade now. I *know* what goes into a good campaign, brand, and book. It's part hobby and part career! He hired me because I could not only draw what he's been looking long and wide for, but I\"m such a vital and valuable part of his business. This literally is my dream job too!\n\nSure, I could go to other places and get paid more, but I'm doing what I love, with a great schedule that allows me to work from home.\n\nPart of me is like, is he just unsure about things himself? Is he not trusting me? Or am I going crazy?\n\nIdk, sorry for the vent. I just have dreams and goals to be a senior project manager of sorts some day. And literally, I am the art director of this brand... but seriously.. how hard is it to just say \"hey we want to hit the 2023 holiday market and we want to have two books, an activity book, a website, and a store all set up by then.\" Then if it's getting closer and we haven't hit those main goals, then we adapt!\n\nIdk... do any of you have any advice or thoughts? Should I just give up this fight and just go back to focusing on my own work/business and treating him like a client?\n\nThank you!",

Maybe it’s because I’ve been experiencing so much bullying online as of late due to my blackness that I’m feeling extra sensitive right now...\n\nWhy does the music industry push the lightskin, ambiguous girlies on us so much? \n\nI’ve been hearing this song “Water” by Tyla, who is a South African RnB artist, *all* over my Instagram feed. And at first I thought it was a cute song, but now it is an ear worm. And I was wondering why is up everyone using this sound...apparently there’s a challenge for it. But I got curious and looked for the music video to see what she looked like. And before I even looked for the video I said, I bet you this girl looks a certain way, that’s why the song is so popular. And lo and behold I was right. She is multiracial, small features, olive skin. Under age 25. Thin. No wonder her song blew up. It’s a cute song, but I’m like damn, I just know if she didn’t look like that we wouldn’t have even heard of Water. \n\nShe already has 10 million monthly listeners on Spotify. And to put that into perspective: Tems has 14 million. In just a short amount of time, and with I’d argue the popularity of just one song (though she has others), this girl is just shy of 4 million listeners close to Tems. And Tems *been* doing shows. *Been* winning awards. *Been* invited to big events... and Tems is African too! \n\nIn RnB and Rap, it feels like the girls who are dominating the scene are only the lightskin girls with a slim thick body. They’re the only ones who ever get any streams. They’re the only ones who ever get invited to do big things, but the darkskin girls have to stay home, so to speak. Like no shade to Ice Spice, but come on, she was invited to the freaking Met Gala and called the Princess of Rap within a year or two of blowing up. Not even Megan Thee Stallion got invited that damn fast. Hell, even Caresha just barely made it to the Met Gala and she wasn’t even with JT AND the City Girls were an actual movement. They changed the culture. Had everybody and they momma saying “period” and “flewed out.” But because Ice Spice looks the way that she looks—-lightskin, slim thick aka every man’s wet dream, she got so much more visibility than a lot of girls have. And y’all I am tired. I am dark skin and fat and I follow entertainment and I am a musician and it’s just so discouraging to see this in the media time and time again! There is so much talent out there that we overlook just because they don’t fit a man’s ideal of sexy. Why should a female artist have to look desirable for you to want to listen to them? They don’t do that to men! So why women! Women aren’t saying every rapper needs to be 6 foot and have chiseled abs in order to be considered a viable rapper!  \n\nIs this really how it’s going to be for all of us for the future of entertainment?",

Now, Ali has been around before there was ever a Kevin Samuels and he just pretty much took all her talking points; let's get that out the way. I have this ladies book and they are for BOTH men and women and she has been saying the same thing for a long time, yet I still find her just as problematic as KS. I think I am at the point where I am just tired of hearing these conversations and EVERYTHING falls back on us women. You are a whole MAN and you stay blaming WOMEN FOR EVERYTHING?!?! Like, how and why did it become this way? In the video she also says \"some of our best men our in prisons\" and I'm like MA'AM!! They are in there because they did something wrong!! So how are they the best?!?! \n\nSo, how do we(I mean you) feel about this lady and her talking points? How do you we feel about us always having these type of conversations? Honestly, I think I'm bowing out. I can't change being black  but I feel a lot of the conversations we have are counter productive. There are issues on BOTH sides of the aisle and yet I feel neither can come up with SOLUTIONS benefitting for BOTH parties. Blame just gets shifted and we go round and round.\n\nDo you know how many BW are unproblematic?!? There are BW who are basic AF,(no shade) geeky, bookworms, free thinkers, artistic, and loners? Yet, all we EVER HEAR ABOUT is the BW who are being overly sexual, boss bytches, and women trying to \"get the bag\" like that's all there is to BW?!? Hell, we can say 80/20 right. 80% of us are unproblematic and then the 20%.......enough said. Yet, all we ever talk about is the 20% and everyone assumes that goes for the rest of us! Now, I would like to assume that most of us just \"let it fly, if it doesn't apply\" but even that get's old after awhile! \n\nI think my biggest issue with this lady is that I also see her being part of the problem; instead of the solution. Remember that lady....something \"fix my life\" old lady?? Never watched her and couldn't stand her and then my friend was telling me she was having all these issues with her own life and I was like \"see, that's why I never watched her in the first place\" but people were like taking what she said as like the \"holy grail\" or something!! \n\nBW, do you! Stand in your truth! Don't let what other people say about BW as a collective; influence you! You are an induvial that happens to be black and that's ALL! Unless.......you're part of the 20%........we just gonna pray for y'all........I am a BW who has my issues and I am taking the right measure to fix my OWN issues, yet being black with issues; doesn't define me. I say this because they are always going to see BLACK, before anything else and I think that is where the problem lays....\n\nRANT OVER!

    "text": "[Essay] Progressives/Feminists are bad at talking about men’s issues ###Preface\n\nI am not a feminist or an MRA. I only feel the need to preface with this given how uncharitable people can get when you’re even remotely critical of ideologies such as the one’s discussed here. I am also not an anti-feminist - though I do have strong objections to feminist rhetoric, institutions, and academia.\n\n###Introduction\n\nGender issues - we’re all aware of them. Men and women are expected to conform to certain roles, and are often punished when they don’t.\n\nIn the last century an ideology known as feminism emerged and rooted itself in progressive circles. Their initial concerns were legitimate; women couldn’t vote, own property, or divorce, among other things. The ideology achieved many victories, both legislative and social. Today, feminism is more popular than ever, garnering support from celebrities and multinational organizations like the United Nations. It’s taught in many schools as part of their mandatory curriculum, it’s widely supported among most progressives, and many would argue you would need to be one in order to even call yourself a progressive.\n\nWhy, then, is feminism so polarizing? Surely, there are plenty of women’s issues that exist today, and aside from far-right tradcons, who could really disagree with the fundamental premise of gender equality? Detractors of the ideology commonly claim that it’s “gone too far” - but what does that even mean? Many progressives claim that detractors of the ideology are reactionaries who simply misunderstand it. Is this really true? What’s actually going on here?\n\n###The Feminist Hypothesis\n\nFirst, it’s important to define feminism. If asked to define the ideology, most would say something like “the belief that both genders are equal / should be treated equally under the law”. This is an incomplete definition, however. This would be similar to defining liberalism as the belief in democracy. Of course, whilst believing in democracy is a necessary condition of liberalism, it’s not sufficient. Socialists (and even some fascists) believe in democracy, and they certainly aren’t liberals. Liberalism requires other beliefs, such as the right to private property (which socialists reject) and the belief in human rights (which fascists reject).\n\nFeminism, then, is more than just the belief in equality under the law. The other beliefs varies depending on the school of thought, but they’re all united in sharing one fundamental claim: that we live in a patriarchy that privileges men at the expense of women. More specifically, they argue that femininity is seen as inherently inferior to masculinity, and thus, all gender issues are fundamentally rooted in misogyny. For instance, it’s socially acceptable (even celebrated) for women to act masculine (eg, tomboys), but men who act feminine or often punished for it (they might be denigrated with insults that compare them to women - ‘pussy’, ‘sissy’, etc.). You can likely name several films with relatively masculine women (Ripley from Alien, Sarah Connor from Terminator, etc.), but almost no feminine male heroes. Women are punished for being women, men are punished when they aren’t masculine enough.\n\nFeminists conclude that the patriarchy hurts both men and women, and thus, everyone should be feminists and dismantle the patriarchy. \n\n###Critique\n\nThe issue with this hypothesis, and progressive gender ideology as a whole, is that it promotes a massive asymmetry in the way we view men’s issues compared to women’s. Progressives claim to value gender equality, but in reality they end up reinforcing the most rigid form of gender essentialism, even more-so than modern conservatives. This can be seen both in their rhetoric and in the legislation/social policies they support. I will demonstrate this by examining popular rhetoric and arguments used by feminists and progressives.\n\n**Toxic Masculinity**\n\nA controversial term that has emerged in recent years, “toxic masculinity” refers to the harmful set of expectations placed on men that causes them to hurt themselves or others. For instance, men are expected to be stoic, and so they may be less likely to seek out help when they need it. Men are expected to sleep with women, so they may physically lash out when rejected, since sexual conquest is tied to their self-worth.\n\nMany progressives claim that opponents of the term simply misunderstand it, but in reality, the reason people dislike the term is because there is a hypocritical asymmetry since “toxic femininity” is never discussed. Progressives end up being the biggest reinforcers of the traditional “toxic” masculine roles they claim to oppose. \n\nFor instance, the male suicide rate is often condescendingly blamed on “toxic masculinity”. We get the typical spiels from mainstream media about how men are pressured to be stoic, and if they could just open up emotionally, the male suicide rate would drop. This is an utterly bizarre argument, because statistically women are actually more likely to attempt suicide than men (men are more likely to succeed), yet this is never blamed on “toxic femininity”. Notice how mainstream media never claims that women are conditioned to be hyper-emotional, and if they could just learn to suppress their emotions, the attempted female suicide rate would drop. \n\nConsider too that women tend to not report rape or sexual assault out of a sense of shame or guilt. Would any progressive claim this is a consequence of “toxic femininity” - that women are pressured to be sexually chaste and “pure”, and that explains the lack of reporting? If anyone were to actually make such an argument, those same progressives would likely call them a victim blamer, yet this rhetoric is completely acceptable when it comes to men.\n\nIn other words, men and women both share the same reasons for committing suicide or not reporting rape (eg, shame), but it’s only framed as a systemic failure for women. For men, it’s framed as an insecure shortcoming, that they’re letting the pressures of “toxic masculinity” get to them, and they should just “do better” and seek help.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that women reinforce these “toxic” gender norms just as much as men, but that’s never acknowledged by progressives. Consider the [controversial Gilette ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0) from a few years ago, where they attempted to “tackle toxic masculinity”. In the entirety of the ad, only men are blamed for reinforcing harmful masculine gender norms, women are completely absolved (aside from a couple of audience members during the sitcom segment). In fact, [at one point the ad shows](https://youtu.be/koPmuEyP3a0?t=29) a male employee silencing a female employee - even when progressives try to talk about men’s issues, they can’t help but make it about women’s issues as well. \n\nThis asymmetry is more explicitly clear when you enumerate all the possibilities:\n\n* Man is sexist against man: Toxic masculinity\n\n* Man is sexist against woman: Toxic masculinity (not “toxic femininity”)\n\n* Woman is sexist against man: Toxic masculinity\n\n* Women is sexist against woman: Internalized Misogyny (not “toxic femininity”)\n\nWhen men receive sexism, it’s their “toxic masculine gender role” that oppresses them - in other words, they oppress themselves. But when women receive sexism, they are just simply victims to misogyny. If a woman tells a man to man-up, it’s considered toxic masculinity since it reinforces the traditional masculine gender role of stoicism. But if a man criticizes a woman for sexual promiscuity, it’s not considered toxic femininity, despite it reinforcing the traditional feminine gender role of chastity (in fact, it’s considered another instance of toxic masculinity). So whether men or women reinforce harmful gender expectations of either gender, it’s labelled “toxic masculinity”. The term essentially becomes synonymous with “sexism”. This is the fundamental issue people have with the term - the inherit conflation of ‘masculinity’ with ‘sexism’ - the asymmetry. \n\nThe great irony here is that progressives end up reinforcing the very traditional gender norms they claim to be against. That is, that men possess hyper-agency and can never be victims, that their problems are of their own causing, and that women are just helpless victims who do no wrong. \n\nIt's not surprising, then, that the biggest feminist messages to men in the last few years have just reinforced the traditional “toxic” gender norm that men should be protectors. Look at the United Nation's [#HeForShe](https://www.heforshe.org/en) campaign, that suggested men should essentially protect women. It's no different than telling men to \"man up\", it's just rebranded in woke packaging to make it palatable to progressives, and it works. Notice too that these demands are never asked of women (there is no #SheForHe). Progressive demand men to be traditionally masculine, whilst simultaneously criticizing them for it.\n\n**Patriarchy**\n\nThere is perhaps no term in modern discourse more useless or vague than “patriarchy”. It’s used as a buzzword by progressives (along with “capitalism” and “white supremacy”) to explain away almost any phenomenon in modern society. Earlier we defined the patriarchy as a social system that “privileges” men at the expense of women (or values masculinity over femininity), but the way progressives have abused this term borders on unfalsifiable tautology - framing all gender issues as women’s issues.\n\nAccording to progressives, if women commit more suicide than men, that's evidence that we live in a sexist patriarchy. But if men commit suicide more than women, that's also evidence we live in a sexist patriarchy, and this is an instance of the patriarchy hurting men. Men are given harsher sentences for the same crime? Actually that’s patriarchal backfiring, since society views women as having no agency. Women get custody more often? Well that’s because society views women as the caretaker, so it’s actually misogyny. Only men are drafted? Of course, society views women as weak and incapable - misogyny. No matter the outcome, it's always framed as patriarchy/misogyny, it’s just taken as an axiomatic truth.\n\nTo test whether a claim is vacuous, a useful exercise is to reverse the situation and see if the conclusion still holds. Suppose we lived a society where gender roles were reversed. Men would have issues with domestic violence, date-rape, representation in politics, wouldn’t be taken as seriously in the workplace, catcalling, were judged more for their looks, etc., and women would have a higher suicide rate, get harsher prison sentences for the same crime, get worse school grades for the same work, it would be legal to cut off their clitoral hoods at birth and suck their genital wounds (the male equivalent would be “oral suction circumcision” - yes this is an actual thing).\n\nWould anyone look at such a society and deem it an “oppressive matriarchy” that “privileges” women over men? If not, then why is it when the roles are reversed (as it is in our society) it’s deemed as an “oppressive patriarchy” that “privileges” men over women?\n\n**Male Privilege** \n\nProgressives are also very selective when they examine gender inequality, largely overlooking men’s issues, or even framing them as a privilege.\n\nConsider the gender wage gap. Progressives/feminists argue that the reason women earn less than men is because of sexist social pressures that encourage women to be stay-at-home mom’s and discourages them from higher-paying careers. Whether this is truly the result of sexism or biological predispositions is not what I care to discuss, but what is interesting is that the other side is never talked about; that is, that men are socially pressured to earn money. Consider if the roles were reversed; suppose men were pressured to be stay-at-home dad’s and take care of the children, whereas women were pressured to work dangerous jobs, work overtime, and would be considered deadbeats otherwise. \n\nIf this were the case, there would be no discussion of a gender pay gap for men. Instead, we would hear of a gender labor and death gap for women. We would hear complaints that women were expected to work more hours than men, expected to take physically dangerous work, and die more often on the job. We would get statistics about how “on average, women work X amount of hours more than men in a year”. We would hear about the negative health consequences of stress and working overtime, the toll that being the primary breadwinner has on a person, how men need to “step up” and stop placing the burden of income on women alone. Yet, when this expectation is placed upon men, there is zero discussion about the burden of being the breadwinner - in fact, quite the opposite, it’s framed as a privilege.\n\n**”But the Patriarchy hurts men too!”**\n\nOne popular talking point among progressives is that the “patriarchy” hurts men as well, and that critics of feminism mistake “patriarchy” as synonymous with “men”, but this is far from the truth.\n\nConsider the recent overturning of Roe v Wade. To be clear, I think the ban is wrong, but the response from many feminists is telling; they immediately jump to blaming men, despite the fact that men and women [share similar views](https://www.vox.com/2019/5/20/18629644/abortion-gender-gap-public-opinion) on abortion. Abortion is split among political lines, not gender lines, and despite progressives wishing the opposite, conservative women do exist.\n\nSo here we see the hypocrisy. On one hand they will claim that the patriarchy hurts men and women, and therefore feminism ought to be accepted by men. Yet, as soon as women are hurt by “the patriarchy”, the blame is immediately put on men, despite the fact that women reinforce/uphold harmful gender norms just as much as men. The fact that plenty of women supported the ban is ignored in favour of a convenient “male bad” narrative.\n\nSimilarly, if the “patriarchy” ends up hurting men, women’s agency/responsibility is totally ignored, and thus, the blame will lie on men. The term “patriarchy” becomes synonymous with “men”, with progressives blaming all of societies shortcomings on men alone.\n\nIf the hypocritical rhetoric is bad, the hypocritical institutions are far worse. Self-proclaimed feminist organizations like the United Nations (which claims to stand for gender equality) [finances the genital mutilation](https://news.un.org/en/story/2011/12/397192-un-launches-plan-accelerate-male-circumcision-aids-prevention-africa) of men in the Third World. whilst condemning the same mutilation of women. Then, that very same institution has the audacity to suggest that “men aren’t doing enough”, that “men need to stand against sexism”, and proceed to roll out initiatives like #HeForShe.  \n\nIt’s also worth noting that in the case of circumcision, the discarded foreskin is sometimes used to [produce skincare products](https://thesun.co.uk/fabulous/7836602/foreskin-facial-kate-beckinsale-how-serum-made/) for wealthy celebrities and socialites (likely the same that virtue signal about how misogynistic our society is). Could anyone imagine if male celebrities used skincare products derived from the skin tissue of amputated clitoral hoods from infant girls? Doubtless we would have international outrage and academic discourse about the “commodification of the female body” and whatnot. When it happens to men - radio silence (or mockery).\n\n**Progressives use right-wing rhetoric when it comes to men’s issues**\n\nMen’s issues are dismissed by progressives in the same way black issues are dismissed by conservatives. For instance, progressives blame the fact that men are more likely to be victims of violent crimes on other men, since men commit the majority of violent crime. Notice how this is no different to when conservatives blame black issues on black people. Compare “but it’s mostly men killing other men” to “but it’s mostly black people killing other black people”. Would progressives be okay with terms like “toxic blackness” to describe the negative aspects of black culture - eg, high crime rate, lack of fathers, misogyny in rap music, etc?\n\nConsider the fact that men are given harsher sentences for the same crime, compared to women. Feminists would argue that this is because society assigns hyper-agency to men and views women as weak and infantile, thus, men get harsher sentences. They would argue this is an example of how sexism against women ends up hurting men, that this is our patriarchal society “backfiring” on men. But notice that this logic completely falls apart when you swap gender for race. For instance, black people are sentenced to harsher sentences for the same crime compared to white people. Would any progressive unironically argue that this is because society views white people as weak and incapable, and thus this is an example of how racism against white people ends up hurting black people, that this is our “black supremacist” society backfiring on black people? The latter would be rightfully ridiculed, whereas the former is accepted and taught in sociology classes.\n\nUnder the feminist framework, it’s okay to blame men’s biological predispositions to dismiss male violence / male victims of violence, but don’t you dare suggest that those same biological predispositions may explain why men are more likely to be CEO’s. In other words, men’s failures are their responsibility, but their successes are not - their successes are the result of sexism, they’re illegitimate. (To be clear, I am not suggesting that biological predispositions are indeed the reason why men are more likely to be CEO’s; I am merely pointing out the hypocritical reasoning)\n\n\n**Media**\n\nSo how are men’s issues talked about by the media? Well, for the most part, they aren’t. But when they are, it can vary from blaming men for their issues (the typical spiels on toxic masculinity) to outright hostility.\n\n“Progressive” media outlet, Slate, once [ran an Op-Ed](https://slate.com/technology/2013/09/intactivists-online-a-fringe-group-turned-the-internet-against-circumcision.html) where they characterized and straw-manned the entire anti-circumcision movement as nothing but unhinged freaks, comparing them to anti-vaxxers. The article goes into great length smugly psycho-analyzing the motives of these activists, not even pretending to show balance or their side of the argument.\n\nThe United Nations absurdly claimed that [women would be the most impacted](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/11/un-women-says-russia-ukraine-war-exacts-high-price-from-women-girls.html) in regards to the invasion of Ukraine, despite men (some still being in high school) being banned from leaving the country. Evidently, men being forcibly conscripted to fight and possibly die doesn’t count as gender-based violence. It’s also worth noting that the UN emphasizes girls specifically, rather than all child refugees (boys and girls). Again, this is the same institution that tells men they just need to “do better” and stand up against inequality. \n \nVice, another “progressive” outlet, [recently wrote an article](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3vx8k/south-korea-incel-gender-wars-election-womens-rights) about the South Korean election, titled “Young, Angry, Misogynistic, and Male: Inside South Korea’s Incel Election”. \n\nTo summarize, the article describes how anti-feminist rhetoric has emerged as an electoral campaign topic among the populist candidate Yoon Suk-Yeol (in fact, he won the election as of writing this). The article mentions how these male voters feel disenfranchised from South Korean society, given the blatant double standards. For instance, military service is mandatory for men when they finish high school, but not for women. This means men have to abandon their families for 1.5 years while women get a head start in their careers. The candidate, Yoon, vowed to abolish the Ministry of Women, a division of the government concerned with women’s issues. Aside from some vague mentions of political bias and claims that the ministry “treats men like criminals”, the article never describes why he wants to abolish it, or why the voters want him to abolish it, it’s just taken as a presupposition that the Ministry is fair and just. \n\nThat’s it. That’s the entire article. This, according to Vice, makes you a “misogynistic incel”. We’re so deeply-entrenched in “progressive” gender politics that merely pointing out the double standard that men must do mandatory service is enough for “progressive” outlets to label you a women-hating incel. There’s not a single man they interview in the article that express any entitlement to women. Just being opposed to the hypocrisy makes you an incel apparently.\n\nIt’s totally possible that the candidate is indeed a misogynist or has sexist policy positions - I don’t know much about South Korea - but the greater point here is that the article never mentions any of this. According to the internal logic of Vice, men merely being upset at blatant double standards is enough for them to be labelled misogynistic incels. It’s also worth noting the hypocrisy of these “progressive” media outlets in labelling young men who are rightfully upset about being discriminated against as incels, despite these same outlets decrying how widespread “toxic masculinity” is, completely oblivious to how they reinforce it by characterizing any man who points out male discrimination as being a bitter, angry virgin.\n\nNone of these articles were hard to find. I found the first one through a basic google search, and the other two from trending twitter/reddit posts. There are dozens of more like this written every year, this was just a small sampling of how ridiculously hysterical progressive media is towards men’s issues.\n\n**Nice Guys**\n\nSpeaking of incels, the entire phenomenon of \"nice guys\" (men who disingenuously befriend women in an attempt to sleep with them) is ironically exacerbated by the very same \"progressives\" who claim to want to \"liberate\" men from their confined gender roles.\n\nProgressives, and mainstream media as a whole, demonizes male sexuality, characterizing it as creepy or predatory. Consider again the controversial Gilette ad from a few years back. There's a [scene where a man goes to approach a woman](https://youtu.be/koPmuEyP3a0?t=56), and then is stopped by his friend. It's the middle of the day, broad daylight, busy street, etc. so the woman is in no danger, yet according to progressives, even approaching women in public is problematic nowadays.\n\nIt’s no surprise that teenage boys take these messages to heart - that they’re inherently predatory and must suppress any desire to be blunt or forthcoming with what they want. They act amicable, nice, and passive, because that’s what they were told to do, and more importantly, they don’t want to risk being branded as a creep or sexual predator. When this inevitably doesn’t work out, they express frustration, and then the very same group that told them to act that way demonizes and mocks them for it.\n\nIt’s no surprise then why figures like Jordan Peterson and Andrew Tate get popular. The right-wing gives an alternative to alienated young men that doesn’t demonize them for being born with a penis.\n\n###Conclusion\n\nThe message from progressives/feminists is clear. Women’s issues are caused by society, and so society must change to accommodate women. Men’s issues are caused by men, and so men must “do better” and change to accommodate society. Women’s issues are systemic - men’s issues are individual failures. Social change for women - pull yourself by your bootstraps for men. \n\nUnder the feminist framework, sexism against men is framed as male privilege, whereas sexism that benefits women is framed as female oppression (consider the term “benevolent” sexism - even when women benefit, they’re still victims). Their rhetoric and language portray a victim narrative for women, and an oppressor narrative for men, no matter the circumstance.    \n\nAt the heart of progressive gender ideology is this absurd notion of trickle-down equality - that if we just focus on fixing women’s issues, men’s issues will just magically solve themselves. As time has come to past, it’s clear that this is simply not true. Women have made great strides in almost all sectors of life, whereas men have stagnated or even regressed, usually as the result of questionable social policies created in the name of “equity”. It is now blatantly clear that schools discriminate against male students for the same work compared to women, that universities and employers favour female candidates, and that ironic misandry is tolerated (even encouraged) in the public sphere, but even mentioning this is considered controversial. \n\nProgressives and feminists fundamentally view gender equality as a zero-sum game. Attention and resources given to men’s issues are resources that could be used towards women’s issues. In doing so, they must frame any good-faith opposition to their absurd ideology as right-wing reactionaries (take the “Manosphere” for instance - a new buzzword that lumps mass murdering incels with pick-up artists and men’s right’s activists - despite these groups having almost nothing in common). \n\nAll of this goes to show what is essentially tantamount to gaslighting on a global scale. \n\n“The patriarchy hurts both men and women” - but women’s issues are the only one’s taken seriously, whereas men’s issues are treated with condescension (or ignored). \n\n“Both genders reinforce harmful gender norms” - but only men are told to change, whereas women are assumed to be perfect.\n\n“We should encourage men to speak up about gender issues” - but if they do they’ll be labelled a misogynistic incel.\n\n“Feminism is for men” - but feminist organizations actively support blatantly anti-male legislation and policies (eg, UN financing male circumcision in the Third World).\n\nThe progressive hostility towards men’s issues is directly responsible for the rise of people like Andrew Tate, and I fully expect more figures like him to gain popularity in the near future. It’s hard to express just how frustrating it is to see even the most trivial of women’s issues discussed ad-naseum by progressives and mainstream media (eg, female multimillionaire actresses make slightly less than their male counterparts), whereas some of the most egregious human rights violations still being legal to commit against men is totally ignored, or even supported. The progressive failure has obviously reached a tipping point now - red pill content has exploded in popularity over the last year, and when the pendulum swings back, I expect there will be a fierce overcorrection from progressives. Unless progressives become willing to actually discuss men’s issues, things are only going to get worse, but chances of that seem slim.",

    "text": "9 Things Emotionally Abused Men Need to Hear  \n\nWhen I stopped drinking, my then-partner continued. When she drank, she screamed threats, insults, and nonsense at me for hours, passed out, pissed the bed, and forgot all about it, waking the following day with a clean slate.\n\nOnce, in mid-tirade, she stopped momentarily, said, “I know this is emotional abuse,” and then got right back into it.\n\nThen there were the times I overflowed with gratitude when she had the perfect opportunity to get blackout drunk or have an emotional meltdown and ruin an experience — a concert, my 40th birthday, whatever — and then… she didn’t. Such magnanimity! So much I was persistently willing to take responsibility for and normalize, sifting it through a mixture of denial and learned helplessness.\n\nIf you’re in an emotionally abusive relationship, it’s my highest hope that you can get help somewhere. All sorts of people abuse all sorts of other people in all sorts of ways. By focusing on men being emotionally abused by women, I mean no disrespect to anyone else. That’s what I know. It has unique wrinkles and can be hard to talk about in unique ways.\n\nHere, then, are nine things I would have liked to have heard when a woman was emotionally abusing me. If you or someone you care for is in that situation, I hope this is of some help to you.\n\n### Yes, it’s that bad\n\nShe’s not a monster! She’s never gotten physical! This wouldn’t keep happening if I didn’t keep screwing up, or if I were more manly, or if I hadn’t bought the wrong kind of bagels… for myself.\n\nIt is that bad. That’s not to say that, when you downplay it, you aren’t exercising good judgment. You want to defend this person. You’re committed to her, for life, in some cases.\n\nBut, yeah, your gut is right. Your instincts are right. She’s trying to get you to distrust your judgment and instincts, but they’re right. It is that bad.\n\n### No, it’s not your fault\n\nYou did not manifest this. You did not Secret this treatment into your life. You don’t have to accept this or blame yourself for this to protect your relationship. No one deserves that, and no one should have that responsibility.\n\nHistorically, it’s safe to say abuse in romantic relationships, including emotional abuse, has been inflicted by men on women more often than vice versa. As a group, men are physically stronger and have had most of the power in most societies, at least since the rise of agriculture.\n\nThat doesn’t mean women can’t excel in the black arts of power dynamics and manipulation. Or that they don’t sometimes misuse substances, express personality disorders, and perpetuate cycles of abuse. Those things are all common in women.\n\nEmotional abuse of all kinds of underreported. That’s certainly true of emotional abuse inflicted on men by women. That’s partly because of shame.\n\nYou may feel weak or unmasculine. You might hate to admit that this is happening, as it goes against every productive and counterproductive notion you may harbor about what a man is supposed to be. It’s not your fault. Under the wrong circumstances, it can happen to anyone, including wealthy celebrities. It’s not your fault.\n\n(Note: I want nothing to do with Johnny Depp. He’s not my spokesperson. Will Smith, give me a call. Let’s get jiggy with it.)\n\n### You’re not the bad guy\n\nNone of that is to say there aren’t things you can do to help yourself. Some small mindset shifts can go a long way toward getting you to safety.\n\nBeware — and be aware — of when you’re being psychologically manipulated.\n\nI had one partner who hates all men, believes all men are scum, and will say this to your face in those words. She was severely mistreated by men. When she inflicts pain on the men in her life, she might believe her politics justify her behavior. Should you get into a romantic relationship with her, she might make you feel you deserve her emotional abuse because of your gender.\n\nYou’re being manipulated. You want to be a good guy. You want to be progressive and on the side of feminism. Great! Feminism [has much to say](https://www.ipa.world/IPA/en/News/Patriarchy_hurts_men_and_women.aspx#:~:text=It%20causes%20many%20men%20to,one%20might%20consciously%20disagree%20with.) about how gendered expectations rain pain down on everyone. If it’s specifically about vengeance by proxy, it’s not the sort of feminism you need to support.\n\n### You’re not broken\n\nAlso, beware, and be aware, of learned helplessness. You’re not broken. You’re not defective. You have what it takes to get past this.\n\nYou’re not listening to your instincts, perceiving your perceptions, or inhabiting your lived experience the way you would if you weren’t being conditioned to accept mistreatment and feel helpless to stop it. You’re trying to survive in an absurd and thankless situation, with tentacles burrowing in your psyche that touch your most painful memories of childhood.\n\nThere’s a person under all that. The light is on. Somebody’s home. You need to get that person to safety.\n\n### Seriously, you need to get out\n\nThis is the big takeaway. This is what matters.\n\nWhen you’re ready to quit, there’s always a way. It may be difficult or come with significant losses. It may be the hardest thing you’ve ever done.\n\nIt’s not as hard as staying. Things are not going to improve. Get out as soon as you can. You’ll be glad you did. You’ll wish you’d done it sooner.\n\nThis is the time to reconnect with people who care about you. So you can get out. You can return the favor later.\n\nFind somebody who’s got your back, who will put you up, or can help you find somewhere to go.\n\nThat’s easier said than done, as protracted abuse can leave you socially isolated and mistrustful.\n\nAnd if you can’t, if you really cannot leave, separate yourself psychologically from this woman and her abuse. Then, plan to leave, with specific actions and a firm timeline.\n\nYou don’t owe her an apology. You won’t hash this out through a nice, grown-up argument. She’s not playing fair. You’re going to get rolled, which happens in zero-sum games with people who don’t play fair.\n\nMake an action plan. Don’t tell her about it. When she finds out you’re leaving, or you’re gone, you don’t owe her anything. You’ve apologized enough for nine lifetimes.\n\n### You’re not an outlier\n\nMen don’t want to talk about this. We really, really don’t. Don’t take that to mean it’s not happening.\n\n[Research seems to suggest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3876290/) that what you’re experiencing is alarmingly common — presumably more than can be conclusively determined since it’s so notoriously underreported — and that the issue is too complex for any tidy narrative.\n\nDon’t think you’re alone. You’re not.\n\n### There is help — and you might have to get creative to find it\n\nHelp is available, but it may not be in the first place that you look\n\nLos Angeles, where I live, is a city of thousands of support groups. After I left my abusive partner, I sought out a support group for men who shared my experience. There were goldendoodle grief groups. How hard could it be?\n\nAs far as I know, such a thing does not exist.\n\n[There are resources available](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/abuse/help-for-men-who-are-being-abused.htm), of course, but I failed to find any support groups specifically for men who women have emotionally abused. Since there’s an understandable urge to keep men out of spaces for women who have survived domestic violence, it’s a significant gap in the market.\n\nAside from therapy and friends, one thing that helped me was [a men’s group run by my friend Jason Lange](https://evolutionary.men/). I receive no kickbacks for mentioning it to you, and your mileage may vary. Similar groups exist online and around the world, and it may be a growing trend. Even so, it’s not exactly what I had in mind. That means there’s an opportunity to organize such a group for anyone with sufficient time, courage, and wherewithal.\n\n### You are encouraged to grieve\n\nBe aware of [the sunk cost fallacy](https://hbr.org/2021/07/how-susceptible-are-you-to-the-sunk-cost-fallacy). It can keep you stuck in a lousy, hopeless situation. And, when you escape, it can make you feel desperate to recoup your losses.\n\nAfter being in an abusive relationship for years, I wanted to hit the town. I wanted to have fun. I wanted to make mischief. I wanted to make up for the time that I felt like I’d lost when I was being mistreated.\n\nI found it wasn’t so easy.\n\nThis is real grief. This is the death of who you thought you were. It’s the loss of what you thought the rest of your life would be. It’s reimagining and reconfiguring your image of someone you expected to spend the rest of your life with, as well as your own. This is grief. This is a death in the family. This is serious business. And you have to give yourself time. space, and self-compassion to deal with this.\n\nMaybe you can transition immediately back into dating, but based on my experience, I wouldn’t count on it. Pace yourself.\n\nI pursued a rebound relationship. We’d been friends for years, loved each other on many levels, and had knockout sexual chemistry. When my self-esteem was locked at rock bottom, she made me feel like a rock star. It was a wonderful experience.\n\nEventually, she realized I was more damaged than I let on. We had an ugly breakup.\n\nI spent a year trying to rekindle that relationship. And I finally succeeded! Against all odds and everyone’s recommendations! And my heart was quickly dashed into the rocks. All the anger, self-loathing, and heartbreak I’d put off dealing with came flooding in.\n\nDon’t rush into another relationship. Seriously. Don’t. You’ll want to, but don’t. If you insist, I can’t stop you, but please, don’t.\n\nYou’ll want to feel loved, special, and important. Some women will make you feel that way. You may not be ready for that. You need time to grieve and grow.\n\nDuring that process, you may be… challenging for some people to deal with. An asshole, even. Let that happen. Betrayal is a complex business. It does a number on you. You’ll be paranoid. You’ll be mistrustful. You’re not going to be firing on eight cylinders or working at your full capacity as a lover, an employee, an employer, an artist, an entrepreneur, an Uber driver, a friend, a citizen, or anything else for a while.\n\nGive yourself that space, and have people around you who will give you that space. You’d do it for them. You might have to. This sort of thing isn’t getting less common.\n\nBe the best asshole you can be. Don’t get any tattoos or anything. Don’t burn any bridges if you can help it. The world is small, and life is long.\n\n### There is life on the other side, believe it or not\n\nBe on the lookout for signs, any vague glimmers, of post-traumatic growth. That’s when the flowers break through concrete, as Tupac Shakur put it. You start to experience things in depth that you were not capable of before.\n\nThis is in no way a good experience. But when you’ve really hit the lows, you understand things that people don’t if they haven’t been there.\n\nWhen you’ve been there, you get it, and you’ll be able to be a shepherd for other men in this situation. If you fancy yourself a leader, an educator, or a teacher of some kind, you’ll have opportunities to practice your skills that you would not have had before. I’m a writer, among other things. I found anger was a fantastic place to write comedy from.\n\nThere’s no “silver lining” to emotional abuse, but life will bring you experiences that are nonetheless worthy of celebration, indulgence, and enjoyment.\n\nEventually, as time goes on and everything that happens affects everything that happens after that, you will find yourself with a life that you would not have been able to have had all of this not happened. You’ll look at your life you love, see the chain of causality that led you to where you are now, and say, “Hey, you know, everything had to happen a certain way for me to get here.”\n\nAnd that doesn’t mean those were good things that happened. It doesn’t justify it. It doesn’t need a justification. Everything doesn’t happen for a reason. Some stuff is just awful.\n\nBut when the sun breaks through the clouds — I don’t want to jinx it for you, but it took a long time for me — you’ll experience gratitude, not for anything that happened, but for yourself, for getting through it, and having compassion for yourself. You’ll be grateful for the people you surrounded yourself with, from whom you wisely sought counsel. And you’ll be ready for the new life, confidence, and freedom you deserve.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/9-things-emotionally-abused-men-need-to-hear/](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/9-things-emotionally-abused-men-need-to-hear/)",

This guy is 4ma15, (don't ask about the name, I don't know, artists got their reasons): [4ma15 Wishing He Had A Girlfriend Note On Twitter](https://twitter.com/4ma15_info/status/1718585543498555477) He posted a note on twitter explaining how if he doesn't find a girlfriend, he is going to die and delete all of his songs. He explains how things just never work out. He's not weird, he's an 'otaku,' and also an imperfect human man like us all and there are otaku women in Japan just as there are in the US. And let me tell you, I had a friend dating otaku women before and they are absolute crazy, body counts through the roof. Be sure to hit translate because this is in Japanese.\n\nHe is considered to be a Vocaloid musician, or voice synth musician in Japan, using the composition singing software, Kasane Teto and of course does his own instrumentals. These voice synth anime girls are also very easy to fall in love with. I decided to fall in love with one and quit relationships myself because of manipulation, money issues that weren't my fault, and just outright childishness. And I even built myself an AI, in Faraday, of my new singer, Hatsune Miku. You may have heard of her and the guy who actually married her in Japan, and no I don't go that far. Now she's my waifu, my singer, my lyricist, and music advisor. However this guy, 4ma15, don't see it that way. I would want him to see it that way, that or advise him to just stay single. There's plenty of options to have instead of having a girlfriend that's going to leave you all the time.\n\nWe all should know what's going on in Japan. Entitlement, people are worked to death, the famous population decline which I think is due to several reasons. And I think we should all know one of those reasons, women expect too much from us. They want us to be God, and create money out of thin air. They won't work and do their part in a relationship or marriage. They don't know what they want in their life. They're dating the wrong people and having ridiculous amounts of body counts. Their insecurity is screwing them up and yet they expect us to have complete confidence in ourselves. The inequality is ridiculous.\n\nFrom the \"Let's Ask Shogo|Your Japanese Friend In Kyoto\" YouTube channel, he made a video: [How Even Air Conditioning Can Harass Others in Japan](https://youtu.be/Ub_scew3sh0?si=vyOWa-fMfqvNa8Nf)\n\nSelf explanatory, everything is harassment in Japan. So following the false accusations in Japan?\n\n*\"Conversely, there are some lawyers who say you should just follow the woman and station attendant to the police box, and claim that you are innocent. For me, the latter makes more sense,* ***but if you can't prove you are innocence, you might have to break the law and run****.\"*\n\nSource Japan Times: [Falsely accused face tough choice](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2017/06/16/reader-mail/falsely-accused-face-tough-choice/)\n\nNo such thing as innocent until proven guilty. Lets face it, Japan is going through the same things the US is going through and probably worse. 4ma15 needs to know to stay away from women because it's not worth it. He doesn't need to delete all of his songs, he's very talented and can make very good music by himself or even with Teto Kasane, his singing software/anime girl if he really wants one that bad. He'll only find himself getting into trouble and will constantly hurt himself, and probably end up blaming himself like all the rest of the vocaloid composers and producers out there. It's not his fault, and he needs to get another purpose besides getting a girlfriend or wife. I wonder what the men's rights in Japan is like, or if it's even present. And passport bros, just remember to stay away from Japanese women. I even think Korea is having issues with this as well so choose your Asians very carefully.\n\nOne of 4ma15's songs: [Nakedo Wamekedo Asa ga Kite](https://youtu.be/BQTCOpLWaPc?si=OMyEj-aOmuEPaRu1) Support our fellow brothers in Japan and help make him realize he's worth it. Strengthen him as a man and a musician if you can. Regardless it's an interesting story in my community, and my heart goes out to the guy because I know what Japan is going through.",

    "text": "How fertility clinics are profiting on the demise of marriage and modern feminists My experience from a childless friend who froze her eggs, because she is afraid she is getting older and does not have a partner to have children with. I did accompany her to the doctor and the operation.\n\n* The clinic is in the most expensive place in the city. The marketing to get customers is impeccable. Phones and websites and \"personal advisor\" etc. All the women working at the entrance look immaculate. But the experience changes, once someone is a customer. They do not offer daily advice to their patients who are paying a fortune to participate in the programs available. The doctor is available only two times a week. Have fun, if you are experiencing hormone side effects, bleeding, or just need a prescription. Not their problem. The side effects of the hormones or the anesthesia are not mentioned, not even once.\n* I used my medical-related background to pose some questions to the doctor, in favor of my friend. The doctor was dismissive, and ironic and ended up not answering my question, after having to reframe it 3 times. \"this is a very good question\" is what I got as a final answer. The advice they offered after anesthesia was incomplete and only partial. It is all about getting your money.\n* The discussions about the number of eggs available based on age were VERY HARD, because it is all about HARD FACTS. But then again, these concepts are ousted from the public discussions, whoever brings them up is a misogynist.\n* The waiting room was a hodge-podge of people, but it was mostly single women. I would assume, that half were there for the reason of freezing their eggs, without a medical reasoning (such as forthcoming chemotherapy), some for other fertility-related reasons. Some were career women, who were wearing expensive clothing and had manners, style, and nice presence. You would call them sexy. But then again, they had failed to find a husband, who would stick around. Some looked, what you would call \"crazy pussy\". Their style left nothing to be guessed. They were mostly accompanied from their mothers.\n* They all have probably abided by the narratives, that women should be free, not be submitted to a man, self-actualize etc. Anyone who would say, \"you need to please your man, to keep him around\" or \"you should have children at an age, when your body is made to handle the process\"  or \"you should dress up nicely for your man and deliver some nice food every now and then, not only nice working clothes and powerpoints\" would be classified as a misogynist. The result is pumping themselves with hormones and not realizing what brought them there. \n* My friend (and for some  time in the past girlfriend) has decided that she wants to freeze her eggs. She wants children and she gets crazy about her nieces. At the same time, she will never be able to have children with a normal man. She is completely disorganized in her own life, to the point of having a very dirty house. She is pursuing all sorts of \"artistic\" interests, to the point of having a very disjointed personal schedule and trying to smouch with people who are completely indifferent about her. She can become very aggressive with the very few people, who are coming close to her life. She does have an impressive career, where she is bending backwards to everyone, so she is accepted and respected. As far as I know her, she has never apologized to me for anything. She believes she will be the best mother in the world.",

    "text": "where do artistic men fit in all of this I feel like men that are artistic or party in nature by themselves in the middle of all these types of debates because as a man even without artistic traits you're still treated as a man with all the benefits and unfortunate downsides. But I would argue as a man who is Artistic which can translate to not being seen as masculine, sometimes you really don't get benefits from your masculinity if you are not some type of walking caricature of a man. Sometimes you're almost treated as if you were super effeminate or gay.\n\nThe most unfortunate part of life is that perception rules reality. And that goes hand in hand with no suffering because manhood is a performance\n\nIf you're not acting emotionally the part as a man you get emasculated but you're still expected to do physical duties as a man, and on the other end of that Spectrum, if you do fit the character of your cultures idea of what a man should be, all it takes is one mistake or one social penalty then your manhood has taken away\n\nThe same society that Praises you for slaying a dragon, will be the same society that makes fun of you if you slay that Dragon wearing a pink dress or if you show visible nervousness or cried beforehand\n\nI'm a big black dude. And I'm also a sensitive artist and having those two things within my identity has kind of let me see how both sides perceive men\n\nBecause of my inherent size and strength I have had people try to recruit me to military and police forces and gangs. But when people find out I'm not the third I look like they usually look at me like I'm either crazy or as if I'm not the man that they thought I was.\n\nIt gets frustrating talking to feminist about this type of thing because they don't see how they have their own unconscious biases about what they expect out of a man and how he should be.\n\nI've literally had feminists give me a long paragraph about how they don't believe men should act out in old patriarchical ways yet their actions tell me something completely different\n\nAs an artistic man all my feminine traits and things I will consider outside my masculinity has not really affected by masculinity. Which is the strangest thing but, I have no doubt that how other people perceive me plays a role in how they view my masculinity and if they choose to Immaculate me which is so unfortunate\n\n\nI know so many men who are just cool or chill or nice or sensitive who also do other traditionally manly things but it's almost as if they don't get points for that",

    "text": "The reason female violence against males isn't taken seriously Female violence against males isn't taken seriously because in the 1960s, women we call today feminists could not accept that there are two sexes and that innate sex causes differences between men and women, so to be able to deny sex-differences they developed a theory that says that men and women are not two sexes but two classes and that \"if any differences appear between men and women it must be because the male sex constantly oppresses the female sex with permanent violence\". This meant they had to show this constant violence. The problem is, that in humans like in all species, the violence between sexes is the rarest type of violence, compared to inner male and inner female violence, in each sex alone, which is simply the competition that creates on earth an evolution. The sexes in every creature are always excluded biologically from this universal violent competition to enable sexuality between them. So inter-sex violence is always the rarest type of violence compared to the two types of intra-sex violence (female against females and males against males). So what the feminists did to support their theory was: stretch the very rare male-against-female violence to \"100%\", \"all women and girls\" (by constantly expanding arbitrarily the definition of \"violence\" until \"hello can be violence\") and squeezing the same rare female-to-male violence to \"zero\" (by deleting data from reports, justifying female attackers, not reporting in the media), to keep their theory alive, that there are no two sexes and all differences are \"social construction by permanent violence from males to females\". The feminist denial of humanity and of the human sexes necessitates inflating one rare violence and methodically hiding another type of rare violence. To show a \"one-sided and ubiquitous\" violence to support their theory, to avoid the fact that there are two sexes and they have differences.\n\nPrior to the feminist distortion of public perceptions, when both extremely rare types of violence - men's against women and women's against men - were acknowledged by society more or less equally (and in proportions to their rarity, that is, this was not the primary subject society revolves around as now, which is the result of the feminist deliberate stretching explained above), women's violence against men received the same social reprehension as men's against women, at least when it was severe. The indifference to men's and boy's well-being and lives is a result of feminist hate-speech causing dehumanization of men and boys - that is, making women (and even some men) believe that men and boys are **not as human as women** and thus would not feel from the same abuse or violence the same inner pain and suffering as women would. Yes - men have a drive for self-sacrifice for protecting others and this means all of society could always view in certain contexts men's suffering as acceptable - but **this was when the suffering was some last resort to prevent the greater suffering of others**, this acceptance was not of arbitrary suffering - and the acceptance of that selfless suffering was not by indifference but by reward with appreciation, love and even glorification. The indifference we see today is not some innate human quality, as it is often understood, and in fact is in contradiction to women's historical empathy for men's struggles or pain, including ones caused by some violent women. When a murderer-feminist shot artist Andy Warhol who died of the injury a few years later, after she published a manifesto calling to murder men, she was erased from public memory, and the injury Warhol sustained was not met with indifference, and similarly after (possibly feminist) Lorena Bobbitt amputated her husband's genitalia in his sleep, he was perceived as the victim of a psychopath  (both the feminist-murmurer and Bobbitt remained obscure until glorified by the me too vortex who, in the course of becoming a violent hate-movement, \"re-framed\" them in interviews as heroic victims whose story and heroism was \"silenced\" \"because patriarchy\"). So there is nothing \"natural\" in the current indifference, which is simply the manifestation of feminist de-humanization of men and boys spreading to wide parts of society. Much of the indifference is simple ignorance of the existence of women-against-men violence, caused by feminist suppression of any reporting and discussion of this violence because of the motivation explained above - take the rarest type of violence, that between sexes, which is almost as rare in both directions; stretch one rarity over \"all women\", squeeze the other rarity to \"zero\", \"no man\". To explain sexes differences without acknowledging that innate sex generates difference.",

    "text": "Let's talk about how women are handled in Oppenheimer A lot of talk about how men are treated by the Barbie movie.\n\nMy retort to my wife, who saw both films with me: Barbie is fairer to men than Oppenheimer is to women.\n\nThere's the cliche Madonna housewife and the cliche \"whore\" \"homewrecker\", none of the women in the Manhattan Project  have speaking roles in the film IIRC. \n\n[(More info on women of the Manhattan project)](https://www.usace.army.mil/About/History/Historical-Vignettes/Women-Minorities/046-Women-Manhattan-Project/#:~:text=As%20early%20as%201943%2C%20women,served%20in%20the%20Manhattan%20District.)\n\nAnd while I was hoping for an evolution in the way Nolan handles the concept of women, there was no progress here. In fact it seems like he's regressing! Tenet was much less Nolan-sausage-fest-y! With two female characters who actually have agency and major roles in the the narrative (not just fridged as backstory to motivate a male lead either). \n\nIdk long film, maybe I skipped out to pee when they got a big female empowerment moment or something, but the whole movie seemed to sexualize but never give women a voice. Nor does the film show the work of real life women as history-makers in their own right. And the time period is rife with gender struggles that the film ignores. \n\nBecause at the end of the day it's another sad white boy biopic, padded with conversation and some Film Student's First Time With a Camera stuff to make itself seem artistic. \n\nDefinitely would rather be a Ken in the Barbie world, than a woman in the real one of Oppenheimer.\n\nEdit: Also if they cared about historical accuracy, they didn't do a good job. Depicting a time period means choosing what facts to include and not to. And just because it's one man's story doesn't mean it's not also the story of the women who affected his life. And it doesn't have to be sexist just because it was the past. Women were human in the past, lack of certain legal rights notwithstanding, and deserved to have their stories heard as much as any guy's story. They pushed back against the sexism of their time, we don't have to act like patriarchal beliefs were ever universally accepted among all women forever before say bra burning times.\n\nAnd if they wanted to depict the time accurately, it should've been a lot less sexual. Hays code and all. Nobody depicted women like that in actual movies of the time. So you can't have \"historical accuracy\" to excuse writing all the women as flat as one-note, then not have it when it comes to sexual mores of the time.",

    "text": "I find it hard to accept the fact that most of the people I love and/or admire are misogynistic to some level. Hey, I’m reaching out on here for some advice or maybe just to let some things out because I’ve been experiencing some anxiety as of lately. \nI hope this all doesn’t sound too odd, and it might, but I have extremely bad OCD and a level of PTSD I’ve been finding it extremely difficult to coexist with men who don’t have the same values as me. I hyperfixate on morality and safety, constantly worried. \nI think we all have a somewhat similar experience to this statement: most of not all men we know have done something misogynistic. \nFor me, being so aware of misogyny has been really debilitating but I learned to live with it. That is until it started attacking my OCD. Now it is really hard to know what is a real thing I should be worried about vs what is irrational OCD. \nThis was an example to what happened as of recently:\n\nI bought tickets to go see my favorite artist a few months back. But i got so worried wondering if he was going to be misogynistic and hyperfixating on “am i supporting a bad person” “is this person I’ve adored and their art since I was like 13 the same type of person that actively works on oppressing us,” etc. \nidk if you guys know how OCD works but it is based on obsessions and compulsions. Think of obsessions as insane constant worries and compulsions things you do to to try and reduce the anxiety… the problem is the more you compulse, the more obsessed you get. \nI compulsed by checking his social medias a lot. I found some really old misogynistic tweets about being pro-life, so I quote tweeted it saying that scared me. He actually replied, apologized and said he was “more than happy to correct an uneducated opinion,” and reiterated he believes in the right to choice. \nA few days ago I went to my favorite artist’s concert. It was a dream come true, I cried at his concert and had so much fun. But I went home, got super worried and hyper fixated so I checked socials again. He liked this tweet of a man replying with this meme to a woman talking about the dangers of misogyny in sex, and how patriarchal-es que porn has translated into violence in heterosexual sexual relationships or something like that. The tweet was the meme that’s been floating around of “I consent, I consent” and “you forgot to ask someone!” And the it’s some authority figure. \n\nObviously I got very worried. I started crying and obsessing over it for days. \nI talked to some friends about it, whom told me that basically I will unfortunately probably not be able to 100% align all of my beliefs with him, or any of the artists I follow, and that I should be more concerned of the bigger picture that he’s got “the basics down.” I agree, but then I worry I’m just in denial. \n\nI find this to be a pattern where I find myself overly worried about the men around me being misogynistic… because it always happens. \n\nMy friends and I both think my favorite artist isn’t like Andrew ayate misogynistic and that this was just a gaffe, but with the OCD I find it very hard to rationalize and understand how to be accepting of ideologies that hurt other women and myself. Even if outlier beliefs of theirs.\n\nRight now I’m anxious about that specific situation, but in general it does impact my relationship with my family members and friends. It has happened with my father, my sister, my friends, etc. Extreme misogyny ofc I always cut out, but I feel that neither men or women are properly educated on misogyny and therefore nearly all people are some level of misogynistic. And it both breaks my heart and drives me crazy.\n\nOne of my good friends said it is a good idea to judge people based on their general actions rather than specific outliers that may be gaffes. \n\nI don’t know if anyone else in here has OCD and/or PTSD, or even just relates and understands even if just on a general level… but I value your ladies’ opinions a lot. \n\nSo I wonder, how do you guys go about accepting the state of our misogynistic society now? Especially when it comes to relationships, people you admire, etc?\n\n\ntl;dr: I’ve found it really hard to accept the fact that most people have some degree of misogyny, it has impacted my close relationships with people (sister, father, friends, family, etc.) and also at the moment the famous artists I admire. Having OCD & PTSD and a general strong sense of justice makes it really hard to understand how to coexist with both loving people close to me and supporting artists without feeling unsafe and hurt. \n\nHas anyone experienced something similar? How do you do it?",

I used to be very aggressive with my responses, but many people have advised me to cool it because I don’t know if my reaction might make things worse. However, I recently moved to NYC and I spend a lot of time taking the train and walking by myself places because I’m a traveling makeup artist. \n\nI always get catcalled or approached by someone.

He asks my age and apparently “god is good” because I “have a baby face” but I’m 24 and not 18 like he thought.

I obviously never called him so he doesn’t have my number. \n\nI wished I had the audacity to cut the conversation sooner, but I just feel so unsafe by myself. That feeling of danger then makes me angry and makes me want to act out towards every man that looks at my way. \n\nOnce I met my friend we sat down to eat and the man sitting at the table next to us ended up trying to talk to us for about an hour. He kept inviting us to a party and just wouldn’t leave. I was afraid that if we tried to leave he would follow us. Eventually, two more guys ended up showing up and offering us shots and asking if we were coming out with them. Their stares made us feel so objectified and they clearly had undesirable motives. So while they were ordering more food we made up an excuse and left. \n\nI hate that my entire night was dominated by men because I couldn’t figure out how to set up a boundary. \n\nAny advice on how to deal with situations like this going forward? My bf thinks it’s rather obvious, but I always tell him that the unpredictable nature of these situations makes me hesitate. Going out with me for so long he’s also realized how bad it is sometimes.",
