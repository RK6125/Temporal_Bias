    "text": "I wonder how much faster appendicitis diagnosed in people who don't have a uterus. I went to the ER when I started having symptoms of appendicitis. I was 36 at the time, in full possession of all my faculties, well-spoken, educated, and not in enough pain to derail my composure. I explained to the ER staff that I believed my appendix to be the problem, they took my vitals, blood, and urine and put me on a stretcher-bed in a shared triage room with a bunch of other patients and their companions. This room was way off the beaten path and no nurses or other staff were nearby. The other patients were mostly sleeping since it was very late at night. \n\nAfter two hours passed, I walked/shuffled over to the nurses station and asked if I would be seen soon. They didn't seem pressed to make it happen, but about 45 minutes later a female PA came in and interviewed me...about my menstrual cycle and only about my menstrual cycle. I advised her that I have had my cycle since I was 9, am no stranger to cramps, or cysts, or other strange uterine happenings...and this was not my uterus or any other part of my reproductive system. I asked that I be scanned for appendicitis. She *patted my hand* and said I would be seen in the order of priority since the ER was so busy and to hang in there. \n\nFour more hours passed. I mostly crawled from the stretcher to the nurses station this time. They miraculously found my MRI orders then. They said it'd be 45 minutes until the MRI, then another hour or so until it'd be read. I had to insist that I get the MRI more quickly and that it felt like my body was in real trouble. They had me in the machine 10 minutes later and then put me in a real ER room. The same PA came into my room a mere 10 minutes after that. \n\nHer exact words were, \"Well, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that you sure do know your body and the bad news is we're keeping you. Your appendix needs to come out right now\".\n\nI replied that neither one of those things qualified to me as 'news' and that I was very disappointed that it took so much self-advocacy to receive a diagnosis. She apologized and I was put on the surgery list.\n\nI was bumped twice on the surgery list. Both times I was bumped for a man, I hope and assume their conditions truly warranted being moved ahead in line, but who knows. \n\nI finally had my surgery, but I spent 7 hours having to convince medical staff to even examine my appendix...all because I have female reproductive organs that they could blame instead. \n\nI wonder how much faster that rotten appendix would've been taken out if I had a penis and testicles instead.",

    "text": "My breast reduction surgeon wants me to ‘consider my future husband’ when it comes to how small I want to go I (21) have wanted to have a reduction ever since I realized I would be much larger than average, probably when I was 15. I’m 5 feet tall but I wear a 36G. They are uncomfortable, annoying, and very disproportionate to the rest of my body. I was finally approved for the procedure through my insurance and was very excited to get this off my chest (pun intended). I was so disappointed when the highly recommended surgeon shot down my desire to be reduced to a B cup because of ‘my future husband’. I was shocked and didn’t know how to reply. I  didn’t want to out myself as a lesbian to this complete stranger, but I also didn’t think I should have to justify what I wanted to do by saying a man wouldn’t be involved. We left the appointment without agreeing on a size and I am supposed to come back after ‘thinking it over’. I have already been waiting and thinking for six months since I spoke to my insurance company. Should I try to change surgeons? I want to get this done as soon as possible, but the whole experience with the doctor made me feel hesitant to go through with him.\n\nUPDATE: I’ve had many helpful comments about how the jump from G to B is a big one and might have complications. I am 100% aware of this- the nurse who spoke to me first made this very clear, and I was fine with that! I just want to be able to do normal activities and I was hopeful that I could get down to a B. The doctor didn’t give me any medical reason not to go through with this size, instead choosing to tell me what my future spouse would/wouldn’t like.",

    "text": "The \"Husband Stitch\" So a few years ago my husband told me that the doctor who delivered his brother asked his dad if he wanted a \"couple of extra stitches thrown in there\" while her episiotomy was being closed. Of course I found this offensive and angering, and a joke in extremely bad taste. \n\nThis morning the topic came around again, and I mused that, back in the '70's, doctors might have actually *done* that shit. My husband scoffed at me and said \"No way,\" and I agreed. I was probably just being bitter bc his dad is a sexist asshole. (Ex: took pictures of other women in bikinis on a family vacation with the family camera, got them developed, and they're still in their photo box.) Out of curiosity, I decided to google \"husband stitch\" to reassure myself that it was an urban legend. \n\n**I was so. Fucking. Naive.**\n\nThe \"husband stitch\" was [totally](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/husband-stitch-is-not-just-myth#The-history-of-episiotomies,-from-popular-to-discouraged) [real.](https://granta.com/the-husband-stitch/) My husband and I just stared at each other open-mouthed for a second because it seemed like such an evil, misogynistic violation that it couldn't be real. But it is. \n\nFor those that don't know, the practice involves putting extra stitches in the vagina to make it \"tighter\" for the man's pleasure because men are still terrified that childbirth makes pussies loose. That's not true, and it also shouldn't be a fucking priority after you just had an infant. The practice can cause a host of complications for women, most frequently **pain during intercourse.** But that's a petty concern when compared to a man's right to fuck. This can affect husbands, too, because it really messes up their sex life. (Hope it was fucking worth it, asshole.)\n\nI took the practice to be separate from an episiotomy, which I thought was a medical procedure, but my husband made a great point: episiotomies used to be routine because they didn't want the vagina torn too much, and he asked me if I thought that was out of concern for the woman. \"No,\" he said, \"the interest in preventing tearing was **also** to keep the husband's vagina nice and tight and pretty looking.\" I had to admit that he was right. (And I was also secretly proud of him. I hit the man jackpot!) \n\nThe \"husband stitch\" is still performed today, and I truly wonder how many women even get asked or told about it.\n\nEven after being on the planet for 43 years, this practice still shocks the **fuck** out of me. One woman described \"laying there like a lump\" while the husband and doctor discussed the extra stitches, ignoring her completely. I always worry about being one of those stereotypical \"angry, man-hating\" feminists, but I'm so fucking tired of men thinking they have any amount of privilege or control over our bodies!!! This stitch shit is fucking crazy! \n\nIt's nothing but a subtle admission that a lot of men see women as non-sentient fuck-holes that only exist to pleasure them. Look at they way they flipped their shit about #MeToo, when it was made loud and clear that they don't just get free access to our bodies whenever it strikes their fancy. And i **know** women have it relatively good in America, but I can't believe that we still have this far to go. And to be brutally honest, I am finding it hard **not** to despise men just a little bit for thinking they're owed a tighter pussy because they were generous enough to let us have their baby. **Fuck that.**\n\nMy husband was appalled, too, but I really needed to rant at some fellow women. Thanks for putting up with me :) Stay safe and healthy out there!\n\nEdit: 20 seconds and the post gets downvoted. I'm gonna throw caution to the wind and assume it's a guy throwing a tantrum because he doesn't like being told that our bodies don't belong to him. How about that person simply respect us out of common fucking courtesy, since it's always the **obviously correct** choice, and just go on from there.\n\nEdit2: **STEPS TO TAKE TO PROTECT OURSELVES**: Fuck genital mutilation, ya'll! From what I have read, there are a couple of simple things we can do to avoid this bullshit:\n\n1. Find an OBGYN that you trust (good advice for all of us!)\n\n2.  Talk to them about how you would like your birth to go and try to establish some kind of plan. Keep it short and simple, say 3 of your most important thoughts. It's always helpful to bring an advocate with you (this is usually the husband if it's an obstetrics appt, but it can be anyone you trust and who knows what you want to achieve.)\n\n3. Ask the OBGYN **what their policy is regarding episiotomies.** Ask them how often they do them and how they decide that it's necessary. *Tell them you would prefer you don't have one if at all possible,* although sometimes they are needed in emergent situations. Use your voice, say that shit - doctors work for *you.*\n\n4. Tell them that you don't want the husband stitch, and if they try to laugh it off, tell them what you know about it and that it's a real thing. Don't let them intimidate you, you have the right to tell them what is and isn't acceptable. If you have an advocate or support, bring them too if it will help.\n\n5. This is unofficial, but I'm a nurse, so: **do your own research before your appointment. ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF**, because a lot of doctors (sorry if I offend, and I'm only speaking from *my* experience) are supercilious man-splainers that are used to having their ass kissed constantly. (And you should see the difference in the way most male doctors talk to female nurses vs. male nurses. But that's another post.) **Don't take that bullshit.** Ask them however many questions you want, make them explain anything you aren't sure you're solid on, ask about meds, ask about anesthesia, bring something to write on. If they order tests, ask them what they're for - doctors will order Bullshit tests to get a few extra bucks from your insurance. (I have seen this happen at nearly every floor I've worked on. It's especially bad if you have Medicare - they charge the fuck out of Medicare.) When it's all over, **ask for an itemized bill.** If something seems bogus, call the office and make them give you an explanation.\n\n6. Again: Use your voice. Advocate for yourself (and the rest of us ladies will benefit, too!) I can't say that enough. Don't let anyone blow you off or condescend to you, and don't leave until you have the information you want. **I love you guys! Stay safe and healthy and vaginally perfect out there!! I know it's painful And upsetting to read about this shit, but THIS IS HOW WE MAKE LIFE BETTER for ALL of us. You're amazing, and i believe in you!**\n\nEdit3: Guys, my inbox is freaking blowing up and i can't answer everybody. **Thank you so much for the awards and the kind words!** I was mortified by this and really needed to talk to some women (I've got some anxiety issues - but who doesn't after 2020), and you guys have helped me so much! Spread the word about this misogynistic fuckery to all the ladies you love of child-bearing years, and keep on being wonderful human beings! <3 <3\n\n**Edit 4: What can we do to raise awareness and hold doctors accountable?** I slept on this, and I have some ideas, but I also need your help. Here are my thoughts: I'm a member of the Satanic Temple, and they do a lot of activism regarding bodily autonomy. This issue seems to be right in their wheelhouse. They have funds and they have lawyers. I think it's worth it for me to email them about this - even if they don't pick it up right away, at least it will put the bug in their ear. I have a friend back in Boston who knows one of the ST founders, and i am going to get him to work this into a convo with Doug sometime. That's one way to raise awareness about this. But what else? How do we find women who have been victims of this? Do we set up a website where they can self report? Does anyone know how to do that, because I'm shit with that kind of thing. Are there any lawyers reading who could give advice? What do you guys think? Can we create a space where we can talk about/collaborate on this - maybe a Slack workspace or something? **What are your thoughts?**",

    "text": "I've had 3 abortions I've had 3 abortions.\n\nMy first abortion was when I was 18. My partner was using a condom that broke, but they never told me it did. I was not emotionally ready for a child. I had the abortion at 6 weeks 6 days\n\nMy 2nd abortion was when I was 19. After my experience at 18, I started taking birth control pills, and used a condom with a new partner. That condom broke. My partner immediately told me, and I breathed a sigh of relief because I knew I was taking pills. 6 weeks later I was 8 weeks between periods. I was not emotionally ready for a child. I had the abortion at 7 weeks 4 days.\n\nMy 3rd abortion was when I was 25. I was living in another country and thought I was absolutely in love with a man I met there. I found out he was cheating, with multiple women, and had lied about his background. At the same time of these other discoveries, I learned that I was pregnant and he moved to another city within days of me showing him the test results and had no way of contacting him. The one friend I had native to the country offered to help me. She took a day off of work (which is unheard of in this country) and took me to a medical facility. Her English fell short and my minimal understanding of the native language was utterly useless. I realized I was on morphine and escorted to a table with a black bagged trash can between the stirrups. The last thing I remember was a nurse kindly wiping my tears away while another told the doctor \"the foreigner is crying\". This was a devastating experience. I physically recovered quickly and my elderly neighbor brought me food for a week even though we couldn't communicate. Clearly my friend had asked her to check on me. I was not emotionally ready for a child nor did I want to have a child with a deceptive person. I had the abortion at 7 weeks and 4 days. (weirdly same as the 2nd)\n\nWhen I was 26, I was back in the States and was living with someone I'd known for years, who knew everything about my life, including the abortions, and loved me whole heartedly because the abortions do not define me or stain my character. We got pregnant. We were shocked, worried that we weren't ready, but knew we wanted to bring a child into the world together, and trusted ourselves to step up. Almost 8 months later, we brought our son home from the hospital.\n\nIf I was forced to suffer the failures of what sex-ed and frigid, uncommunicative parents taught me, I would not have been able to achieve any of my successes and my life (and the lives of any children forced to suffer my limitations) would be totally debilitated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to share my story because for so long I felt like this is a shameful part of my past. But you know what? I'm not ashamed anymore. I am so grateful for the choices I've been able to make. I am not promiscuous, I am not frivolous. I made choices based on whats right for me and now I make choices based on whats right for me and my family.\n\nI can't imagine being deprived of that choice.\n\n\\[this is a throw away account\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: **This community is amazing**. To those sharing your own experiences, thank you SO much for doing so. All of the kind comments and support GREATLY outweigh the negativity. The stigma surrounding abortion is a direct threat to a woman's wellbeing, safety, and their right to control their own life and body. It took a lot for me to write this post. I hope these experiences become easier for others to share, without feeling the need to do so through a throw away account. Be well.",

This happened about two months before covid.\n\nMy wife is a vet student with several years experience working as a vet nurse in the USA. She is the least squeamish person I know. During one of her anatomy practicals she gowned up, smeared vapo rub on her nose, and donned a mask. Some male classmates were making fun of her and others for going to such lengths. \"Be a MAN,\" they said. \"You don't need all that gear.\"\n\nThey were conveniently positioned more than three feet away from any of the dissection tables, laughing and pointing. Meanwhile, my wife and all the other female classmates at her table are up to their elbows in pig innards. Have you ever smelled something that's been embalmed? You have? Now mix in the smell of pig shite and decomposing organic material that failed the embalming process.\n\nSafe to say those lads may have lost the contents of their stomach had they actually gotten close enough to touch anything.\n\nSome of the same classmates gagged when a cow gave birth. Meanwhile, my wife and her good friend both assisted in a c-section on a cow and also helped lamb multiple ewes.

    "text": "Ladies beware the \"frail old man act\" I'm a nurse usually in old folks homes as it's my first love. But I love learning as well so I worked my second job in a nursing role I had not yet learned. \n\nA very long time ago (15~ years) I was working at a county jail. The officers knew I had a rule of not telling me why they were in because I didn't want it to affect my treatment of my patient. \n\nIn our medical wing we had this tiny, foot shuffling, balance wavering old man. The officer was mean to him. Unusually mean. Normally I was allowed in for disabled patients who had a rough time with walking or moving. Not with this man. \n\nAfter the second morning (I did night shift so very heavy morning medication pass all over the jail) I finally said, \"OK fine let's break my damn rule! Why are you so mean to this little old man? He's barely walking! How dangerous can he be?\" after the officer asked me several times if I was sure since he knew I loved my old people he spilled.\n\nThis man walked normal when he thought no one was looking. He was in our facility for review to see if he could be released back into society. He was a very violent and awful child molester.\n\nHe had that cute little old man act down pat. It was perfect because it fooled me completely. I asked the officer how he knew that the guy walked normal. They had obtained permission to move a camera. It pointed straight into the cell window. They needed to be sure if they remanded the guy back to the psych hospital for another year (they did this yearly!).\n\nPlease ladies no matter the age never buy the old guy act.

    "text": "A happy rant about being respected as a rape survivor by hospital personnel. I just wanted to share an experience I never thought I’d have. I’m currently in the hospital after having a stroke. When I was first admitted, I somehow managed to keep my jeans on (usually they’re the first things to go once I’m in a gown). It wasn’t until I got up to my room (instead of in the ER) that I was told to take off my pants to prepare for an MRI. \n\nI’ve never been good about speaking up for myself or my needs. Actually, I can’t remember the last time I told a doctor or nurse exactly what I needed or why. But this time, I took a breath, avoided eye contact, and half whispered, half slurred, “Would it be possible to borrow a pair of scrub pants? I’m a rape survivor. I don’t like not having pants on, especially when people I don’t know are going to touch me.”\n\nGuys. This man nodded solemnly, said he was sorry for what I went through and that it wouldn’t be a problem to find me some pants, and then he left. No questions. No weird stares or awkward silence.\n\nBut there’s more. All I mentioned was wanting pants. I said nothing about being weary of male employees or of my personal space being violated. I didn’t ask for anything to be notated or anything like that. But when my night nurse came in, she asked before she touched me in order to check my IV. She said, “I’ve been made aware of your history, and I’m so sorry for what you went through. I’ll be honest- I don’t know how to help. I know what you’re going through right now is scary enough without your history added to it, and I don’t want to do anything to make you feel uncomfortable. So we can learn together. You tell me what you need, and I’ll make it happen.” I was a little stunned. I hope I didn’t come off as ungrateful, because I’m pretty sure I didn’t say a word. \n\nThen the next morning, a woman knocked on my door and there was a man standing a good distance behind her. She introduced herself as a physical therapist and explained that the gentleman behind her was a therapist as well. Y’all, she asked me if it was okay for him to come into the room. And for the entire evaluation/session, she was the one that supported me as I tried to walk or whatever. He stood back and made suggestions. \n\nAnd then tonight, 5 days later, a male tech came in to check my vitals. Half way through, he looked at my name and went a little wide eyed. He apologized. Apparently he swapped with a female tech so that I’d be more comfortable, but he forgot since this entire hallway was his except for me. \n\nIs this was respect feels like? Anytime I’ve ever asked for a female doctor or nurse when I’ve been assigned a male instead, I get that look. The “why aren’t you over it” look or the “stop being so dramatic” stare. \n\nI can’t sleep at night because A. I already have insomnia and B. I can’t seem to calm down enough to trust going to sleep not knowing who is going to come into my room. So what did they do? My nurse moved her station to do her charting next to my open door. She promised not to let anyone in unless she woke me up first.   I’ve come to trust her the last few days, and she knows that. So she’s purposefully putting herself somewhere that makes life more inconvenient for her to make me feel more safe. \n\nThis all feels like a dream. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t recommend having a stroke. The right side of my body would definitely argue against having another one haha.  But I’m just completely astounded that I’ve been respected as a human being and as a survivor so freaking much throughout this admission. I’d say that I hope we get to a place as a society where this type of treatment is the expected norm, but right now I’m just too amazed to find any negativity in it. Thanks for listening to my rant. \n\nWell. Anyway. Considering it’s 3:44am and I can’t sleep, any one want to share similar stories?\n\n\nEdit: Hey guys! This blew up way more than I expected. Quite a few of you mentioned that I should let the hospital know how great their staff is. I definitely intend to! I actually used to work for the hospital I was admitted to (though it’s been 2 years, was in a different department, and a lot has changed there), so I know who to contact where it’ll be seen right away vs. going the survey route. I also plan to nominate them for the awards mentioned in the comments. Thanks for the idea!\n\nAs far as the name of the hospital goes, please message me for the information. I’m not comfortable posting it here as it could be used to find my location. \n\nAnd lastly, thanks for all the well wishes! I was discharged this evening with some sexy new walking aids, a fancy loop recorder in my chest to monitor and record my heart rhythm, and an appointment on Monday to start outpatient rehabilitation services. Over all, I’m doing okay. It still feels weird to know I had a stroke at 29, but what can I say... I’ve always been an overachiever lol.",

It goes fine, I'll skip the minutia and protocols but want to describe my experience with a special patient.\n\nHe presents himself as a medical professional.  He's a dental hygienist.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  I bet he makes 3x's what I do and that's ok too.  He asks a bunch of questions which is fine but he's objecting to the brand of vaccine because he thinks the other one is better but can't say why other than it was on TV more.  OK.  Lots of stations with people administering doses.  We have pharmacy techs, med students, nursing students and other more experienced professionals should questions arise or a medical emergency result from a vaccination (there were none).  \n\nThis very special patient asked if one of the men from the other booth could supervise the injection.  The man he was referring to was a 1st yr med student who had next to no experience with patient care.  The vaccination clinic may have been the first time touching a patient.  I'm guessing my 20+ years of acute trauma care pales in comparison to someone with a penis.\n\nI told him I could do one better, the med student could give the injection!  Oh he was delighted, as was I.  \n\nMy very special medical professional dental hygienist promptly went to the back of the line and I went on with my day.  A little over three hours later when I left he was still in line and didn't seem happy, but I smiled.  A very tired smile but a smile none the less.",

    "text": "Being a nurse is freaking fantastic - got my ass grabbed twice today. So, being a nurse is a dream for many and definitely a rewarding job on its own - I like it overall but GODDAMN is the sexual harrassment rampant when you're a nurse. Everyday, I get patients touching me and hitting on me or telling me to smile (thank you, masks, for saving me from that) and while it's not really harrassment, it's definitely annoying and fucked up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut today was one of those days. Yeah, those. I got my ass grabbed twice - once by a young, 20-something man and once by another, older one, around his 30s. Both of those times I raised my voice and called the ward director who gave them the biggest verbal ass-whopping I've seen. Of course - \"it was just a joke\" and \"I should learn to take a compliment\" or \"I should stop being so sensitive\" (according to the patients.) Then another two of the patients kept discussing what I have under my shirt and what color my underwear is. What a fantastic fucking day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm at fucking work. From what I'm putting into your drip, I could've easily killed you (of course I wouldn't, just saying that it's possible) and what you're deciding to do is make me mad? You wouldn't do the same to someone with a gun so why now? Just fucking leave women alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Edit for some questions I didn't get to answer because I was sleeping:*\n\nNo, I am not based in the US and for private reasons I don't want to disclose where I live. The laws here are a little different but I could sue those patients. The thing is... If I had as much time to go through with all the lawsuits every time it happened, I wouldn't be a nurse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe do have security in the hospital, but not on the ward I am, mainly due to covid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work on the surgical ward where all the patients are either preparing for the surgery or are recovering from it. Or sometimes they're here to get drips and get their wounds dressed. So we almost never get dementia patients unless they're in for a surgery. As a nurse I get to know my patients' full profiles so I am aware of their conditions and not one of our dementia patients has acted like that towards me. Ever. They're usually very sweet and thankful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo, I am not psychotic for stating a theoritical situation in where I could kill a patient lol. Y'all should stop smoking shit so much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***And lastly, thank you for all the sweet answers and the award!***",

    "text": "I'm so tired of doctors dismissing with anxiety because I'm a \"young\" woman **Backstory for some insight:** A few years ago, I went to the ER 3 times related to my heart. The first 2 times, the doctors said it was in my head and anxiety/panic attack. They said I was a \"young healthy female\" (I'm in my 30s), and 1 doctor said said \"with no family history\" - even though I do have a family history, AND the doctor never asked about family! Both times, the doctors did not even do an x-ray or ultrasound, just bloodwork.\n\nA nurse had pulled me aside, saying \"I have experience with anxiety and you are really coming across as visibly anxious.\"  Of course?? I had to come to the hospital by ambulance, don't know what's going on, of course I'm anxious. At this point in my life, I had never had anything like a panic attack (and I did have anxiety as a teen & resolved, just never panic attacks).\n\nThe 3rd time, the doctor was good and was shocked that 2 doctors before him didn't at least do an x-ray. He said although I'm young, being in the medical field as long as he has, he would hate to rule anything out without investigating further.  He did the basic tests and also an ultrasound. That got me a referral and a specialist, which led to **a diagnosis**, and treatment & monitoring for a heart condition (and unrelated to anxiety). My heart condition was verified by a 2nd opinion, and hasn't brought me to the ER since then.\n\n**Tonight**, I went to the ER for mild chest pain I've been having for 2 days. I tried my inhalers, medication, nothing helped. It is different from my heart condition, which was never painful.  But this is pain and is localized, constant, and causing me discomfort and a little bit of chest tightness. Because of that, and my past experience, I was pretty calm and matter-of-fact, including letting them know it wasn't a severe pain. I also said I wasn't sure if this was actually my heart or lungs, just the area.\n\nUnfortunately, I went through the same experience I had with the first 2 doctors. It was almost like as soon as they heard I am taking a medication for PPD/PPA, they focused more on that and panic attacks. They did a blood test and x-ray, not an ultrasound, and decided it is anxiety.\n\nI asked the doctor why he is categorizing this as anxiety, and he literally responded: \"my experience as an ER doctor.\" So I asked, \"could it be inflammation or something in my lungs?\" He dismissed that (even though he didn't order an ultrasound), and said \"no, I've been doing this for X years, it's likely anxiety\". He also proceeded to tell me he *didn't see the heart condition I've been treated & monitored for years*. I asked  \"can anxiety actually cause pain like this?\" and he said yes. I've never experienced that even when anxious,, so I asked him, \"can that happen for days even if I'm not feeling anxious?\" At this point he seemed annoyed and said \"the mind can get carried away. I'm not a doctor who can diagnose anxiety,  I'm just telling you that we didn't find anything so it's likely anxiety\". Then sent me home with the blood test results and discharged me noting... anxiety.\n\nI am still shocked/frustrated at the treatment. From saying *he* didn't see my heart condition to *if these results are negative, it must be anxiety*, to *I'm not a doctor who can diagnose anxiety* but discharging me with anxiety. That seems to be a common attitude towards women, and when it's a young man, he gets a full workup and follow-ups. The first 2 times before I was diagnosed, I saw the ER doctors tell the male heart patient beside me that they didn't see anything but will run more tests & get him a referral to a cardiologist; but I got told I must be having a bout of anxiety.\n\nI just want to feel heard and taken seriously, *regularly*. Not only after 1 out of every 4 doctors. It took years to get diagnosed with endometriosis, and other times more than 1 hospital/doctor visit before getting a referral to see a specialist. Now, I'm sitting here, still with this pain/discomfort, and wondering what to do next because I already tried to treat myself as if it was anxiety *before* going to the hospital, specifically so they could rule it out. I'm not even hopeful that going to another hospital would yield a different result.\n\nSo that's my vent :( and if anyone has tips on how to handle dismissive doctors like this, I'm all ears. I'm Canadian, but this happens worldwide. Medical care and respect seems to just suck for women.\n\n\n**Edit/update** I got hold of my cardiologist's office, they'll call back in a few hours with a phone assessment then determine from there. Will try to update when I can, as I'm also very sleep deprived at this point.\n\n**Edit 2 (~19hrs later):** thank you to everyone here, and I am so sorry to everyone and/or their family members who have been dismissed in their medical care like this. I truly wish there was a way to stop this from happening.\n\nMy cardiologist's office called back earlier today; they are submitting me for bloodwork to include inflammation markers, which the hospital did not do (but remember, the doctor said it couldn't be inflammation?!). They're having me come in for an echocardiogram on Tuesday, or Monday if they can squeeze me in, and obviously if things worsen or I just don't feel right, I've been directed to go back go the hospital and let them know about tests my cardiologist needs run. If that happens, I hope they do it. And if not, I will try to overcome my shock/frustration and make them note why they would not be performing tests my cardiologist wants run.\n\nAnd what I found both reaffirming and sad is that the cardiologist wasn't even surprised the hospital just brushed it off under anxiety. It really is that common.",

    "text": "Being shamed by people for looking for a safe, healthy, and clean sexual partner. *EDIT* shouldn't have said clean, that's a real fucking rude thing of me to say, because nothing about our bodies makes us dirty💜💜\n\n(💜This is only part rant; I promise there's a little positivity, too.) \n\nI'm a single, divorced older woman with some newfound freedom and a better appreciation for myself as a person than any I've had before now.  This is the first time in my life I've felt confident in myself and what I want; not to mention actively looking for it.  \nI also have a tiny bit free time now that my work schedule has changed and my kids are older and spending regular time with their father. \n\nIt's clear we live in a bit of a hookup culture- and that doesn't even bother me since I'm extremely busy and basically it's all that I have time for right now.  Plus, I'm a very affectionate person, so anyone I hit it off with will be treated really well by me; even if it is just a casual thing.  \n\nPutting myself out there online and in person.....not humiliating or embarrassing at all for me, since I don't act any way except how I would like to be treated. \n\nIt's upfront anywhere I'm online (usually within the first 3 sentences of about me stuff) that if I hit it off with a guy that wants to be my new friend, we will both get STD tests (me reciprocating for them so I don't come off as rude)\nEven when I meet people in person and we've started chatting, as soon as the sparks fly I'm mentioning that if we continue to have enough in common to get closer this is a thing I'll have to have.  \n\nThey ALWAYS agree.  ALWAYS say how amazing and respectful that is, and of course that's the smart thing to do...but then.....the next couple of chats or the next meetup they've \"forgotten\" about it or they say we shouldn't need it.\n\nI've heard:\n\"But, I was in the military and we've had all the shots.  I'm probably cleaner than you.\"\n\n\"I don't even think they really do those kinds of tests anymore unless you say you're pretty sure you've caught something.  Have you caught something?  That's probably why they gave you the test.\"\n\n\"I had mine done like 6 months ago, you trust me by now, right?  It's kinda weird if you don't after a week of chatting, honestly.\"\n\n\"I'll be honest, where do you even get them done?  I'd be too embarrassed to ask my real doctor.  Aren't you embarrassed?\"\n\n\"Baby, I'm clean, I had it done this morning and they said I would only hear back if it was positive.💋 Let's go, stop being paranoid. \"\n\nAnd I've had my own tests done twice for potential friends.  The worst.  THE ABSOLUTE WORST...was the 2nd time when it was my doctor instead of his Nurse Practitioner who  did the first one.  This man has seen me for 20+ years.  He came in and set down with a weary sigh, and asked me what's going on in my life and why am I coming in for this kind of lab work again when he can see I just had it done 3 months ago.  👀   When I explained that I'm just wanting to be sexually active again and have something to show a potential partner, he shook his head and LAUGHED at me!   He accused me of lying and said that I had to tell him if I was afraid I had contracted anything or living a lifestyle that would put him or the nurses in danger by coming in so often (you know, case twice in like 90 days is way too many).  He said this isn't what people do.  He said, \"you know your ex-husband hasn't had to come in here for these kinds of things even once.\"\n\nI just want y'all to know that I took my mask off and looked that man in the face and told him that I want labs done so that I can have sex safely and comfortably with a man or woman that wants to show me the same kind of respect for my health as I do theirs.  I told him it was hateful and hideous to act like it's \"weird\" to want to show a partner and myself that we're both healthy or have a conversation about the methods of how to have safe sex if one of us DOES have an issue and we decide to go forward.  I told him to get ready to do my lab work and have my results printed off for me to pickup when they came back because it would be the last time he saw me or my 2 daughters.  When they get to the age where they need to trust a professional to answer health questions without lectures or judgement about what they do with their bodies its gonna be a completely fucking different doctor than him.\n\nHe did the labs.  I picked them up from the front desk a week later with 3 female nurses smiling at me and giving me thumbs up.😄  I met a man who did the same tests for me and have had 4 Fridays of completely mind-blowing sex.  \n\nPlease protect your health and stand up for yourself to anyone who wants to pressure you or tell you that it's not a big deal.  Your doctor can do them,the Health Department can do them (most cases for free), check you can even ask for them at an Urgent Care type facility.  Most blood, urine, or swabs tests come back in just a few days.   That facial expression I got from him and the expressions I got from the other men and women who couldn't badger me into dropping it were pretty fucking great.   Not as great as my expression in the mirror after that first afternoon of completely happy sex, tho 😍",

    "text": "When your boss has got your back For context, I work as a pharmacy technician at a independent pharmacy and we are currently busy doing our annual flu jab drive in tandem with giving COVID booster jabs (We'll call it F/CJ). Today, a man comes in who we'll call 'Jack' for his F/CJ as our pharmacy assistant just finish sanitizing the seat for him to sit in.\n\nI come over to do the usual pre-jab rundown and prep the F/CJ, Jack then asks \"So, when does the doc come to give me the jab?\" I inform that there is no doctor (we're a pharmacy) and I will be doing his F/CJ. Jack proclaims that it was a doctor the last time, I check his file and while he did go to a medical practice the last time it was actually a nurse who gave him the jab. (This gave me a hunch which we'll get to)\n\nI thought Jack might be worried about me doing it due to my age (I'm only 21) so I tried to reassure him by telling him I'd done well over a hundred jabs and I'm a fully certified phlebotomist accredited by the NHS. This does nothing to calm his nerves so Jack they says \"Is they no-one else who can do it!\" I take a moment to compose myself and then say \"the only other person that do it is the pharmacist\".\n\nHe replies \"Ah, yes! Him, I want him to do it!\" and this confirmed my hunch, he assumed that some \"stupid girl\" couldn't possibly administer his F/CJ correctly and only a man could do it properly. This was further confirmed by the smug smirk he had on his face because he'd \"put the little woman in her place\" but I was going to get the last laugh.\n\nI go to our break room where the pharmacist had finished HER lunch break and told her the situation, she starts smiling and says \"well, let's go disappoint him\". The look on Jack's face was priceless when the pharmacist he insisted on having to administer his F/CJ came out, his smug smirk replaced by a look I can only describe as a naughty school boy who'd got caught red-handed by the headmistress.\n\nBy the time Jack came up to the counter I'd already finished the paperwork so I was going to hand it off to the pharmacist and go on my lunch break but she told to wait for a minute. She gave Jack the patient copy of the paperwork as well as the usual post-jab speech but then said something at the end that I actually didn't expect.\n\nShe says \"Oh, and one more thing Jack. If you EVER disrespect my staff's ability to do their job again, you're going to have to find yourself another pharmacy and explain to your wife why. Do I make myself PERFECTLY clear!\". Jack quickly replies \"Yes ma'am!\", the pharmacist then points at me and says \"now apologise to her\".\n\nJack turns to me and says \"Sorry ma'am, won't happen again\" I was absolutely starving at this point so I just said \"apology accepted\". Jack then quickly leaves the pharmacy to avoid any further scolding, the pharmacist then said \"right ladies, show's over. back to work\" and let me go for my lunch break. It was so nice to know that our boss has got our backs when faced with 'difficult' patients like Jack.",

    "text": "Powerless [Rant] Last week I picked up a really sad case. He's a 31 year old man paraplegic from a gun shot wound he suffered in 2014. He's poor and black. Most of our patients are wealthy and white. He was admitted almost 8 weeks ago with for acute on chronic sacral osteomyelitis and has been on piperacillin-tazobactam and minocycline basically since then. My first day meeting him we were short staffed due to holiday coverage, and I had 23 patients on my census so I did not have the time to explore his chart. I read through the novella-length progress note written by the previous hospitalist and was able to gather the basics. The plan I inherited was to find an orthopedic surgeon at another institution who'd perform hip disarticulation or possibly hemipelvectomy. The big academic shop in town apparently recently lost their surgeon who did those, and the smaller academic shop has a guy who does it but \"only for oncologic indications\" (???) according to the note. The hospitalists before me had tried a few other centers and identified a list of candidate surgeons, most of whom had declined. The last remaining candidate is a few hours away, and documentation indicates that my colleagues have faxed the records for review and consideration for transfer. The note contains a phone number for me to call and follow up. I call and get a nurse who confirms they have the records but informs me the surgeon is out of town for Christmas but he'll be back Monday (yesterday) so please call back then.\n\nI go meet the patient, a very polite and extremely sarcopenic young man. Always \"Yes, sir,\" and \"No, sir.\" I introduce myself and explain that I'll be picking up where the prior hospitalist left off. I explain that I called the transfer center and we're waiting to hear from a surgeon who's out of town, so please just relax over the holiday weekend and I'll let him know as soon as I hear anything. I examine his wounds and see that our wound care team is doing a great job, everything looks clean and freshly bandaged. He has temporal wasting. His calves are as big around as my wrists. I have difficulty auscultating the chest due to the sunken intercostal spaces. I tell him I'm sorry he'll be spending Christmas in the hospital but that I'll be seeing him each day and I'm happy to help him feel more comfortable in any way I can. He tells me his pain is well controlled.\n\nThe next day is Friday, Christmas Eve. I go in to see him with no updates and start making small talk. Football is on TV. He tells me he's a Tom Brady fan, and I joke that I can forgive him one wrong opinion. I look down at him and imagine our positions are reversed. He's one year younger than I am, slowly rotting to death in a hospital bed on Christmas Eve. I haven't seen a single visitor. He tells me he spoke to his 7 year old daughter on the phone. He tells me her name.\n\n\"Well...Is there anything you can think of that would make your day a little better?\"  \n\"I was hoping to get some of that jambalaya from the cafeteria. Or just something good to eat.\"  \n\"What's your favorite restaurant around here?\"  \n\"I like Papa John's.\"\n\nI ask him what he likes from Papa John's, and he rattles off his usual order complete with the dipping sauce he likes. I can tell he doesn't have much joy in life, and a favorite meal is something he can control and look forward to. A small piece of joy in an otherwise miserable existence, living from dressing change to dressing change. The nurse picks the order up from the front door and gets it to him.\n\nThe next day when I see him, he's eating leftovers and watching TV. He thanks me repeatedly, making eye contact each time so I know he means it. I tell him we're just holding the course until we hear from the medical center and thank him for his patience with me. I start him on topical ketoconazole for the dermatophyte infection on his face. After six weeks of broad spectrum IV antibiotics, and due to his chronic inflammation, he is significantly immunocompromised. He hasn't showered at least since he was admitted, just bed baths from the techs.\n\nFinally Monday rolls around and late in the afternoon I get a call back from the medical center. The orthopedic surgeon tells me this is the first he's hearing of this patient and they have no records, oh and by the way he doesn't do that surgery. He usually sends patients to my city for it.\n\nFuck.\n\nHoliday coverage ends and our staffing improves, so now I'm only following 18 patients and I have a few minutes to make sure I understand his hospitalization. I read that he presented with abdominal pain, and CT showed osteomyelitis of both ischial tuberosities, and of his left proximal femur. He had a left hip fluid collection thought to represent septic arthritis from direct invasion of the joint space by his unmanaged decubitus ulcers. Plastic surgery evaluated him when he came in and said he was not a candidate for sacral flap coverage unless he agreed to diverting colostomy. The patient, presumably dissatisfied with his already cachectic and broken body, was not interested in this idea. Eventually with ongoing pressure from several teams, he agreed to go for it. The plastic surgeon had signed off by that point, so the hospitalist re-consulted him for flap now that the colostomy was in place. Inexplicably, the plastic surgeon says he is not a flap candidate and instead recommends hemipelvectomy or pelvectomy by *someone else.*\n\nI'm reading through all of the above history just moments after getting turned down by the orthopedic surgeon who practices few hours away, and in the back of my mind I'm remembering the questions the patient has been asking me -- \"How is this going to heal?\" It dawns on me that perhaps no one has told this young man that we're working to get him transferred to a place where the plan is to cut one or both of his legs off.\n\nToday I went in to his room and told him we had some things to discuss. I ask him what he understands about our goals in transferring him to another hospital. He believes the idea is to \"fix the bone.\"\n\n\"Did anyone tell you that the plan is to find a surgeon who will cut your leg off?\"\n\nHe immediately starts crying. He is blindsided by this. We talk for 45 minutes. I can tell he is getting upset with me, but really he's upset with the situation. We agree on a new goal which is to try to find a surgeon who will consider him for flap coverage. Today I called every academic medical center within 500 miles. Not only do they not have any beds, they won't even offer wait list placement.\n\nSo tomorrow I'm going into work as a hospitalist. Completely useless to this man who needs a surgical procedure. All my consultants signed off weeks ago after collectively deciding it was someone else's job to give the patient his prognosis and options. I consulted palliative care so at least he can have continuity with someone who will advocate for him after I go off service. When I started telling the story to the palliative care physician, I unexpectedly started crying and could barely steady my voice to give the facts.\n\nI'm angry, I'm sad, I'm useless to my patient. I look at him and I see a society that doesn't give a flying fuck about poor people, black people, or gun violence. Compare him to the 5 wealthy white patients I've had with traumatic paraplegia (and quadriplegia) the last few months. They all survived into their seventies or longer. They all have round-the-clock care. They don't have decubitus ulcers. They're not rotting to death alone in a hospital bed on Christmas while some useless fucking hospitalist like me flails about worthlessly and to no effect.\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for your support and suggestions. I alerted administration of the case and also developed a plan with the patient. Much of our efforts right now are confounded by COVID-19. I hope we have a plan to get him his second opinion. It was my last day on service with him. We hugged.",

    "text": "Any tips on changing rude behavior towards certain role groups? This may be mostly venting, but I would certainly appreciate tips.  \n\nIt's a very common thing for patients to be very rude to the techs and nurses and charmingly pleasant with me.  I try to belatedly combat this by always offering to go back and round on the patient as a team so they see us united and have some accountability to what they understand and agreed to.\n\n  I try to head it off by always, always name dropping the triage nurse at the beginning of my interview in a way that credits how I trust them, and name dropping the primary nurse at the end about how they are the meaningful person who will implement the plan.  \n\nWhat else do other people do?  \n\nAlso,  on my most recent shift I had a pair of experiences. I was caring for a minor post op issue for someone operated on elsewhere,  her surgeon was terribly rude to my secretary, yet exceedingly polite, helpful and pleasant to me.  I learned only after the fact.\n\n  Then, I had a fairly typically mildly unpleasant experience talking with an MD of our own who wanted to rant about all sorts of unrelated stuff making it sound like he hates the basic responsibilities of his job, before accepting our patient. I can't help you fix your own intradepartment issues, man.  Later, a nurse came over and umprompted and unaware let me know that he has a great reputation for being nice to the nursing staff.  That thawed my heart.  I would rather the abuse and venting be kept within the role group.",

    "text": "The AMS Consult *No spoilers, but this felt relevant, given today's other posts. Names, details, etc. changed for privacy and because I'm not a total jerk.*\n\n*Apologies, this got a bit long. Please still read it.*\n\n-------\n\nWhen I LARP as a neurohospitalist, things tend to come in waves. Not precisely the same things, mind you. The fine details are endlessly, fractally variable - but the broader brush strokes, much less so. If I see two cardioembolic stroke patients in a day, I can be sure that another five are waiting or actively infarcting in the emergency room. I diagnosed three new cases glioblastoma multiforme (1) in three days. Strangely enough, they all came in between 12-2pm on consecutive days, as if by USPS. A year ago, I diagnosed three new cases of HSV encephalitis in much the same fashion; in proper public health fashion, I confirmed that they all lived distantly from one another, and shared no friends, prostitutes, or toilet seats. \n\n\nNo week is more challenging, however, than the week in which you receive a pallet-full of altered mental status consults. I should take a moment here to point out that that this isn't the kind of challenging you went into medicine for - there's no wiping sweat off your brow, pouring fluids into beakers, or examining blood samples under microscopes till the early morning. You never get to stare up through the ceiling and directly into the eyes of the Almighty, announce that it isn’t this old bitch's time yet, and then - remaining sterile, of course - jam a needle into their living heart with both hands. \n\n\nRather, it's challenging because, in most cases, the obvious things have been done and there isn't much left to offer. There's very rarely an exciting or sexy diagnostic consideration left on the table (2). It only remains to be accepted that, after a certain amount of labs and imaging, obtunded patients will stay obtunded and worried families will stay worried. The patients that generally merit the dreaded “AMS” neuro consult are ill, and often have been for quite some time. Quite a few of these patients have also been alive long to have had lots of other conditions crop up and become chronic - so their medical burden is typically high, even prior to this most recent admission for pooping out a kidney or what have you. To add insult to injury, their labs have only recently become non-catastrophic. \n\n\nNot to be glib, but it's pretty rare that an MRI ordered by neurology will lead to the patient sitting up and starting a nuanced discussion of the Fed's interest rate policy - even if we do it with contrast. \n\n\nIn placing this consult, typically one of two tacit questions are posed to the neurologist:  \"well, the  kidney that's still inside them works, so what the hell?\" or \"We told the patient's family you'd make their brain work again.\"\n\n\nUnfortunately, I never did learn how to make a brain perk up and just start doing better. I try to relay this as kindly and early as I can. I think most of the doctors or families that request my consultation are left with the question \"Well, then what's the point of you?\" It's a good question.\n\n\nI find that the most useful thing I can do is to first make sure that nobody is trying to do a lumbar puncture without any idea of what they're looking for (3), and then take an accurate history. Almost as a rule, somebody else has already taken a stab at it, and reports to me that this frail creature who likely predates the cotton gin is \"usually really sharp.\" This almost always turns out to be the optimistic view of a family whose love allows them to look past things like: falling for repeated Nigerian prince scams; occasionally drifting across the double yellow line, or through a Costco while driving; trouble staying awake for more than 6 hours a day, ever since they saw an interacial couple on television and had their first heart attack.\n\n\nI'm being cynical, of course, and unfair in a few different directions. Not all consults are like that. Not all of these patients are elderly, or chronically confused, or easily explained away by the acute issues that brought them to the hospital in the first place. That's probably the worst part of the altered mental status consult - the knowledge that as soon as you get too jaded or dismissive, the hospital will give you something weird or complex to screw up.\n\n\nWhen the consult popped up on my phone, I could feel my blood pressure spike, just a little. For some reason, pages sent by nurses in our system always appear in caps, which grants a sense of urgency that is often unfair (4). As I read through the chart, things didn't get much better. Sure, the patient was in his 50's, but he was ill! He'd been admitted for covid a few weeks ago, and it didn't appear that a single end organ had escaped unscathed. Lots of his lab values had little red flags next to them, and I was already developing the bitter smugness that makes everyone cherish specialists so much. To top it all off, the notes made mention that the patient's *wife* was the one that thought he was confused! Did the hospitalist themselves even have a question for me?\n\n\nI've been surprised in the past, and so of course I went to see the patient - but don't imagine that I didn't do it without a lot of grumbling and quiet drama. I may have leaned my head back against a wall and sighed a few times. If there had been a rock or empty can in the hallway, I'd have given it a doleful kick (5). I donned my PPE with the pique of a high schooler that shows up for detention, but, like, doesn't even *care* about it because it's just so *arbitrary*. \n\n\nWhen I entered the room, I encountered a man of about middle age, with receding hair that flourished into a mullet, steely blue eyes, and a beard that plunged gracefully down his neck and into his chest hair without the faintest hesitation. He had huge, undefined arms, and the kind of belly that doesn't protrude necessarily, but bulges anyway due to omental abundance and organ huskiness. If we were in a drinking contest, he seemed to be the type that could lift a keg over his head and finish it with a laugh before I was halfway into my first rosé.\n\n\n\"Help you?\" he asked me with a lift of his eyebrows. I don't run into this greeting much in the hospital, and it charms me every time. The scrubs & coat costume I throw on usually signifies that I'm the one providing help, or at least pantomiming it while doing reflexes. So when patients offer, even as a figure of speech, it just feels nice.\n\n\nI introduced myself, gave my usual wave, etc. I asked him some incisive questions about his location, the date, why he was in the hospital. He replied - respectively - with:\n\n\n1) \"A shitbox hospital with half decent food.\"\n\n2) \"You're the fourth guy to ask me that today. It's _______. Feel like I oughta be testing you people.\"\n\n3) \"Fuckin' covid.\"\n\n\nThis wasn't how they speak to one another at Buckingham Palace, but he was hardly wrong. To tell the truth, I was having trouble actually detecting any confusion. I decided to earn my paycheck and ask about some semantics.\n\n\n\"If you would, explain this phrase to me: 'The grass is always greener on the other side.' \"\n\n\nI looked at him expectantly, and he returned the favor for a long moment, before finally asking \"The grass?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, as in a lawn or something.\"\n\n\n\"Kid, I don't give a shit about grass.\"\n\n\n\"Well, sure.\" I said. \"But I'm more trying to see if you can explain the idea.\"\n\n\n\"Well, I'm not a goddamn gardener. How about that idea?\"\n\n\n\"No, no, I get it. You're not growing heirloom tomatoes,\" I agreed. I was holding my hands up, as if in surrender, but I continued to press him, as some deep part of me had apparently decided that this was the hill I would die on. \"But maybe there's something in that yard that you do like.\"\n\n\n\"Like a woman?\" he asked.\n\n\n\"A what?\" Masks can cover many things, and are one of our best chances at curbing the spread of covid19 - but they do nothing for the squeak of a neurologist's voice as they completely lose control of the interview. \n\n\nHe repeated himself, and I stared for a long while, picking my way through an ethical minefield before finally settling on a lame \"Sure, I guess.\"\n\n\nAt this, he fixed me with a piercing look, cocking his head a little as he read deeply - and incorrectly - into my history and character. Then, in a much gentler tone: \"Kid, let me tell you something my daddy told me, ok? Dance with the girl you brung. It's that simple. Don't go looking around.\"\n\n\n\"No, no, not me,\" I prostest. \"I said *grass*, you’re the one that -“ but he cut me off.\n\n\n\"Don't get divorced, kid. You'll regret it if you do,\" he said, with the compassion of a man that had made mistakes, lived through them, and cared enough to pass those lessons along.\n\n\n\"...I won't,\" I promised, in the voice of a hesitant, scrawnier man who hadn't planned to make any mistakes in the first place. At this point, it was clear I had to change things up a little. Mentally setting my jaw and yanking my scrubs up to my nipples, I decided to be direct. \"Look, do you feel like yourself? Or have you been feeling a bit foggy?\"\n\n\n\"Foggy *how*?\" he asked, suspiciously.\n\n\n\"You see, they called me because there was some concern that you were confused,\" I told him. “But you don't seem terribly confused to me, so I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing in here, and how I can be helpful.\"\n\n\nWith that, his eyes narrowed. With a sort of icy calm, he asked me who exactly had said he was confused. I told him that the hospitalist had been “a little concerned,” and there was some mention that his wife “had been concerned as well.” This was, in fact, the most cowardly way I could have put things, and I didn’t do so by accident. Alarm bells were ringing in my head, and if I’d thought speaking in a Little Annie voice would have helped, I’d have done it in a second. Pride goeth and all that.\n\n\nAs it turned out, my fight or flight response had been dead on. When I mentioned his wife, I could feel the temperature in the room drop by at least 10 degrees. He flushed a deep red. The cords on his forearms stood out, and for a moment, it seemed as though the lights dimmed a little. Though he’d hardly moved a muscle, the inappropriate tenderness of a few moments ago was gone. Suddenly, he was fraught with power; a Talladegan Hephaestus who might lay me across his anvil in a rage if I didn’t watch what I said next. Underneath the hum of the jury-rigged HVAC, I swore I could hear the rumble of plates shifting beneath our feet, and the shriek of ball lightning.\n\n\n“*I see*,” he finally said, and his tone was measured. Since I wasn’t entirely sure of what it was he did see, I kept my mouth shut - but I was certain it wasn’t the sort of thing I’d be able to lay to bed with an MRI and some gabapentin.\n\n\n“This again,” he continued, his face beginning to twist with rage. “This shit just *does not end*.” He paused between these last words, giving each their own emphasis, before meeting my gaze with a look that both threatened and begged understanding. “Look, not going to college don't make a man confused.\"\n\n\n“No, obviously not. I mean, Justin Bieber right?”\n\n\n*Immediately*, a wave of regret washed over me. In both my head and my heart, I’d truly meant to say “Bill Gates.” But there appears to be some mechanism, some sort of infernal collapsible circuit just south of Broca’s region, which was built solely with the purpose of making me look like a shit head (6).\n\n\nSensibly enough, he ignored me. “Having a few hobbies don't fuckin' make him confused either.\" His voice was getting louder now. “But any time I don't do something her way don't make me confused!\"\n\n\nIf you’d diagrammed this last sentence, it would have looked like a spiral - but I took it in the spirit in which it was shouted. Cooler heads needed to prevail. \n\n\"I understand that, sir, but I think we need to calm down a little,\" I said. It was probably close to the right thing to say - but consider that I was also wearing foggy goggles, purple latex gloves, and a big blue trash bag that I'd cinched around my hips and shoulders. To my own dull horror, I further realized that, at some point,  I had hunched my shoulders and laced my fingers across my belly (7). Whatever was happening here had years of marital discord behind it. That kind of momentum simply does not get derailed by fancy little gentlemen in DIY Veruca Salt drag.\n\n\n“I know what this is about!” These last words appeared to tear something deep inside of him on their way out; his face wore the faraway tragic expression of a veteran that cannot forget. Then, in a desperate half-whisper: “I left the dog in Charlotte on purpose!”\n\n\n\"Oh, shit,\" said someone that sounded an awful lot like me.\n\n\n“We was in Charlotte in June and we took the goddamn dog with us. Well, when we got ready to come back, I told the dog get in the truck. It never listened, and I just decided, you know, fuck it. That dog never liked me. So I figured I’d just kinda… see what happened.”\n\n\nI stared at him.\n\n\n“So, like, we start driving. Truck’s pretty full, but she didn’t even notice he weren’t there. So I keep driving. I guess after a while it was kind of quiet and suddenly Carol just screams out ‘*Brantley*!’ Nearly drove off the fuckin' road.”\n\n\nI almost staggered at this latest revelation. They’d named the dog “Brantley.” Even dog murder paled in comparison.\n\n\n“She couldn’t believe we’d forgotten him. I mean, *I* could,” he said with a sort of shrug. “But I just kind of played along, you know? Acted surprised and all. I told her it was too far to turn around anyway - it was, like, two hours.” He paused for a second, as if realizing something for the first time. “Two whole hours,” he repeated, more indignantly. “And she says I’m confused?” \n\n\n“Look, I have to stop you here, sir. I’m not sure I can be helpful with a lot of this. I know I can’t, in fact,” I started, trying to build up an exit strategy. But he’d obviously stumbled onto a new line of reasoning here, and he was going to explore it to the fullest.\n\n\n“Maybe she’s the one that’s confused,” he suggested. “Maybe you oughta be having this conversation with *her*.”\n\n\n“No, I should not,” I said, essentially out of tricks.\n\n\nBut, in keeping with our entire conversation to day, he simply ignored me and reached for his phone. I placed my hand over his without thinking and his eyes snapped up to mine. I suddenly felt like a zookeeper that’s forgotten to give the resident hippo a warning pat before it’s nightly suppository. But I held my ground this time, reasoning that no matter the outcome - abrupt violence or continuing this interview with his wife added to the mix - I was going to die in this room. The only way out was through.\n\n\n“Just let me examine you, ok? If everything looks ok, then I’ll leave you alone. If not, then we’ll figure it out together. Just bear with me.”\n\n\nAfter a few moments of reflection, he decided to leave my skeleton inside of my skin, and we got started. It was almost a relief to start getting some objective data, after the swamp of emotional volatility we’d just waded through together. I was certain that after a few cranial nerves, pushes, pulls and taps to muscle bellies, our relationship would reach its natural conclusion. \n\n\nCertainty is generally idiotic, especially when you’re me, and double especially when you’re in the hospital. I showed very little promise as a neuro-ophthalmologist during residency, and so when I watched his eye movements, the words that popped into my head were “janky AF eye twerking;\" the more sober and literate among us would describe these findings as “gaze evoked multidirectional nystagmus, oculomotor apraxia, and likely saccadic intrusions.”\n\n\nHis motor exam revealed similar spontaneous oddities and incoordination. On activation - i.e. when he wasn’t lying still or clutching bed sheets in a sort of righteous fury - his movements were decidedly weird. I either hadn’t noticed before, or I’d written it off as agitation and fidgetiness. But it was in fact a tendency towards choreoathetosis which he was able to transiently suppress. \n\n\nTo get to the punchline, I’ll simply tell you that his sensory exam was fine, and his reflexes were pathologic. His MRI showed malevolent-looking, diffuse T2 FLAIR changes throughout most of the cerebral subcortical regions - including all of the gray matter you don't want to see involved. There were patches of roughly correlating DWI changes, tiny GRE blooms throughout with a particular affinity for the bilateral caudate heads, and no enhancing lesions. \n\n\nHis wife was a story unto herself, and it was a phone interview for the ages. There was a lot of material to get through regarding their marriage, their kids, her mother's loveless marriage, etc. But honestly, at this point, I simply had to know. I would have interviewed Brantley if I’d had to.\n\n\nFeelings and matrimonial history aside, I learned that he worked in a machine shop. I also learned that he did in fact have some hobbies, which included amateur metallurgy and electroplating. He’d started recently, and enjoyed it very much. “Amateur,” in this context meant that he’d assembled a shed behind his house, where he kept: plastic tubs full of chemicals; some car batteries; ladles; a leather apron; some old gold jewelry, in a gunsafe he’d welded to a bunch of weights. Things he had not invested in included: face or eye protection; lids for the tubs; a fan of some kind. \n\n\nI asked about some of the chemicals he used. At various times they'd included nickel, silver, gold, and cyanide. I did confirm this last one. \n\n\n*Mystery solved*, I thought. That’s it. Toxicity from exposure to aerosolized cyanide and God knows what else, yielding neuropsychiatric changes including (but not limited to) atypical eye movements, choreoathetosis, and irrational hatred of what I imagined to be a golden doodle. It made sense. It felt right. There was still plenty of work to be done, and I doubted I could entirely defer a lumbar puncture in good conscience - but it seemed as though I'd finally be able to put a bow on this particular psychodrama, and move on with my life. I started to wonder if this wasn't what Free Willy had felt like, as he leapt over the rock wall, into the sunset, and just over the head of a poorly supervised orphan. \n\n\nAs I started to relax, she dropped the final bomb on me. “Of course, he lost our *first* dog about a year ago.”\n\n\nBelieve it or not, he did have CJD. He had been acting oddly for some time now, and the bizarre, poorly considered metallurgy set up in the back yard was almost certainly more symptom than cause. I followed him, and watched his decline. His initial EEG didn't show me much, but the follow up study in 3 months showed me those classed periodic sharp wave complexes - it was the first time I'd seen them in the wild, and not my attending's file of interesting EEG snippets. I think I only fully relaxed, though, when the 14-3-3 protein came back positive. I spoke to his wife a lot during this period; I don't know how much she liked me, but since she'd only ever known me during the worst time of her life, and I couldn't blame her. \n\n\nAMS consults, as a rule, are an utter goddamn pain. There's no getting around it. And then, maybe 1% of the time, they're the single wildest ride you can take - and they're precisely what you signed on for.\n\n\n--------------\n\n1) A disease whose sole risk factor, based on my own anecdata, appears to be the possession of a beautiful spirit and/or a lovely family.\n\n2) Though when there is, and something interesting shows up in the CSF, I've found within myself a tendency to become a little overconfident. Given enough serotonin, I begin to undo the top 6 buttons of my shirt and slap coffee out of the hands of interns. Surprisingly, I never acted like this back in residency. The mask has been slipping.  \n\n3) this hasn't happened terribly often, but it has happened more often than anyone would like\n\n4) But not always. The single best one I've ever gotten was \"RECTAL NUMBNESS.\" That's it. Aside from the patient's room number, that was the entire page. Also, yes, they did have a cord compression.\n\n5) My shoulders would have been slumped, and it would have been raining, and The Lonely Man would have been playing probably.\n\n6) My theory is that this circuit - if we could only find it - would confirm not only that a higher power exists, but that its possesses an 6 dimensional, extra mean sense of humor.\n\n7) Picture how Patton stood during his famous speech, and then imagine the diametric opposite. Try it right now. I guarantee you that even if they were in another room or state, your significant other just went into a fugue, grabbed their phone, and began to download Tinder.",

    "text": "Are you sure you want us to do everything? Over a year ago, my self-given name of a heart nurse was stripped away by COVID. A few months into the pandemic, I clocked into work one day, pushed the cold, metal plate that opens the door to my unit, and realized that everything has changed. “WARM ZONE” tape covered the door and plastic sheets and masking tape sealed in the openness to the nursing station.\n\nWalking to the desk to find my assignment, a loud buzzing sound muffled the voices of other staff around me. HEPA filters. There is one in every room of the unit. I am handed an N95 mask and told to reuse it until it falls apart. “You are now in a warm zone, so you can’t take it off even when you’re not in a patient’s room.” This thing is so uncomfortable. I texted my husband, “well, we are a COVID unit now,” while planning in my head how I am going to get back into my house tonight without infecting him or my baby girl.\n\nThe coming months in the COVID ICU were harsh. Policy change after policy change came and went trying to keep up with the ever-changing guidelines. While the nursing staff and doctors were expected to maintain excellent standards, everyone else seemed to get special treatment to avoid exposure. Shift after shift, I started to realize that COVID was the worst disease I have ever encountered.\n\nA typical patient that was admitted to our unit with COVID was usually already on their last leg. Intubating was always a last resort. We would keep them on a facemask for weeks at a time. Pre-COVID, patients on facemask ventilation were able to take it off briefly for breaks, food, and pills. I had the same experience with every COVID patient on facemask ventilation.\n\nFor example, my sweet man in room 52.\n\nHe looked so tired and today is day 6 of facemask ventilation. I take off his mask to give him is baby aspirin and notice skin breakdown on his nose and cheeks from wearing the mask longer than it was intended for. It looked painful. Seconds later, his lips turn purple and the monitor alarms “SpO2 62%.” It took hours for his oxygen levels to recover. “Well, I am never doing THAT again,” I say to myself in my head. The next day, I come into his room, and he won’t wake up. I page the ICU MD, “time to intubate,” “ok, get everything ready,” he says. I grab the intubation kit, sedative medications, and call his family. “Are you sure you want us to do this?” I ask his wife. In hindsight, that must have sounded nuts – of course do everything you can to save him! But it seems like such an obvious question to those who have been in my shoes.\n\nShe wants everything done, so I grab the crash cart too – just in case. We intubate him, and like the last 100 COVID patients that we intubate, it goes really poorly. His oxygen drops so low that I am already thanking myself for bringing the crash cart. I grab my team – “we have to prone him or he is going to code and die.” They know exactly what I mean because they too have had the same experience with their COVID patients. “Ugh, his wife wants everything done?” my coworker asks me. “Yes” I reply as I roll my eyes. My resentment toward his wife is clearly misplaced, but he isn’t the only unstable COVID patient on our unit. We have now seen months and months of grieving families. I have told countless husbands, wives, daughters, and sons that they need to come say goodbye to their loved one after weeks of ICU care. “Why is this happening?” is always the question. I wish I knew. I’ve given and received a lot of teary-eyed hugs through isolation gowns and N95 masks.\n\nMy patient we intubated that day was on the ventilator for weeks suffering from skin breakdown and lung fibrosis because of COVID pneumonia. I let his wife facetime him every time I took care of him, and I could never listen to her words of love she had for him because I knew what the outcome was going to be. I was right.\n\nGo down the north hall to the basement, go through 2 sets of doors, make a right and you’ll meet security there. That’s where the morgue is. There were months when I went there every single shift.\n\nThe hardest part was the torture. It seems like a harsh word, but that’s what COVID patients in the ICU experience.  Torture. We all know before they are ever intubated that they are going to die, but we intubate them, put in lines, tubes, flip them on their belly, refuse to allow them to see their family, and code them until they die – alone. That’s why I felt so resentful toward my patient’s wife. She could have had the opportunity to come hold his hand and say goodbye – those were the only times the hospital allowed visitors – end of life. I still am not sure who or what I am angry at – hospital administration, the government, angry families, or Wuhan, China.  \n\nAcross the US, the patient burden skyrocketed while nurses retired early, left the bedside, and took travel assignments to make more money. Our unit felt the brunt of it all. Most of my unit family is gone now – COVID took that away from me too. These are the only people that truly understand what I have been through. If you ever become a patient in a COVID ICU – your nurse is your lifeline. It’s important that your nurse is not chronically overwhelmed by the pressures of the unit.\n\nAt first, I was so angry. Then, I cried a lot and mourned my patients in private. I took a lot of my anger and sadness out on my family. Now, I feel like my heart is as hard as a rock. COVID cases have fallen significantly, but I have changed. I, too, am leaving the bedside.\n\nAmerica, take care of your nurses.",

    "text": "my first palliative case with an awake, oriented and fully cognitive patient. I'm sure lots of people here have had a version of this story happen countless times in their career. But this was my first time, so i thought i'd write it.\n\nAs a little forward, i've seen some 20 cases of palliative patients, they were all either congnitively absent, or so sick they lost contact with the our world.  Some were bound to die soon anyway and we just didn't want to torture them for a couple of weeks longer than they needed to.\n\n2 days ago it was very different. I received an 83 year old man with COPD since 30 years. He already had Lung cancer and Cor Pulmonale with the usual list of diseases for his age. he didn't use his machine at home for the last few days, built up some CO2, was somnolent, so his family sent him to us. His pCO2 was 120 at admission. He had the typical skin of longterm cortison therapy, mixed with the bruises of taking anticoagulants. If you look at his skin wrong it'll bleed. \n\nWe got him on the Bipap machine, underwhich he was doing better, but after 3 days he still couldn't get off of the machine without building up CO2 to 80+ in a short time, and then desatting once he's somnolent again.\n\nAfter those 3 days i wanted to call the family, let them come to talk about the therapy with them. he was already declared DNR/DNI, but we still needed to set a plan. I started by saying that I, as a Doctor and a person, would never want to live in a state where my existence long-term relies on a machine, that i'd never want to be what germans call a \"Pflegefall\" aka \"Nursing-case\" (meaning heavily reliant on care from other people). We already know he's DNR/DNI, but we need further planning in case he never gets off the machine.\n\nThey tell me he also never wanted to be a \"nursing case\", i told them to go talk to him as a family, after some time i'd go there and talk to them. In such cases i always try to tell the family that they are not making the decision (because its too much to ask from them imo), i tell them they are helping US make the decision that would be best for the patient. i feel this takes the edge off.\n\nafter some time, i call on the family, and we go to a seperate room. they tell me they all agreed, they want to turn the Bipap off.\n\ntbh that took me by surprise. I didn't expect that they'd want to do that now. I asked them if they knew what implication that has. they said he'd die. they explained that his visits to the hospital are more frequent, time between hospital visits is shorter, and his in-Patient time is longer. At home he also couldn't be off the machine for a long time. so he flat out refused it for the last few days.\n\nI told them i'll have to discuss this with my consultant, but if everything goes as planned, i'll fullfill his wish, and make sure he is as comfortable as possible. they asked me how it will go once i turn the machine off, which is a question i received often now. I explain that without the machine he'll find it harder to breathe, but we'll manage his distress with morphin, and make sure he is as comfortable as possible. At some point he will sleep, and then just... go. I also explained that it would all happen relatively quickly.\n\nAnd then i sent them on their way, and went to talk with the patient himself. he was still under the BIPAP, he was awake, and oriented. his skin was leaking serous fluid at this point.\n\nHis name is COPD Patient, but we've grown close in the last few days so i like to just call him COPD.\n\n- COPD, did you just talk with your family?\n\n Nods yes\n\n- did you all agree on a decision?\n\n Nods yes\n\n- Do you want this BIPAP machine?\n\n Nods no\n\n- Do you know what would happen if we took you off the machine?\n\n Motions his own beheading with his hand\n\n- and you want us to do this?\n\n Nods yes\n\n- alright. we'll make sure you're as comfortable as possible in the mean time. we'll take care of it.\n\nSo i call my consultant, i explained the situation briefly, and she said \"Do it\". I asked if there is any procedure i should follow? if there is anything else to it but just literally going there and turning the machine off. She said no, Document everything in the chart, then go and turn the machine off. which felt a bit too.. underwhelming? for such a case and such an action on an awake patient.\n\nI've seen many palliatives, but this was the first time in my life that an awake person, with all his mental and cognitive capacity, without being septic or on 3 different pressors with an infaust prognosis, tells me they want to die.\n\nI turned the machine off, give him a morphin perfusor, and slowly escalated it. Without the machine he could be heard again, so he told me, taking breaks between sentences:\n\n\"I've battled this fucking disease.... for 30 years, now... now its enough\"\n\nAt the very end of my shift, while still under morphine, he asked me for an Oxygen mask.\n\nEven though its against procedure i gave him the mask, i didn't find it in me to tell him \"no..too late! you die without oxygen\". so i put him on a little bit of oxygen and then go home.\n\nHe survived the 12 Hours till the start of my next shift, and died 1 hour after its beginning. I hope i never experience it again.",

    "text": "Thank You Letter - from a nurse, to the patient who changed my view on life I seem to find comfort in writing after I have an emotionally charged experience at work, as you can probably gather by reading my previous two posts that I have made on this sub. This happened today, and is still fresh.\n\nAs an operating room nurse, I get to take care of patients who are having surgery. I love what I do for a living and look forward to coming to work every day.\n\nToday was no exception - when I walked into work this morning, I knew that I was going to have a wonderful day ahead of me. The room that I was scheduled to be in had two cases with one of my favorite surgeons in the service that I am part of. I was also working with one of my favorite surgical tech’s, and our anesthesia team members assigned to the room were wonderful as well. \n\nDuring the middle of our first case, we got word that our second case was getting moved to a different room. My coworkers and myself were initially a bit upset and frustrated because that means that we would get a random add-on or leveled case from a different service. Looking back, I wish that I wouldn’t have felt this way because then I wouldn’t have been able to meet you.\n\nIn the afternoon, after our first case finished, my charge nurse found me. She gifted me with a piece of paper that contained information about the surgery you were having done today. Your procedure was fairly short (only thirty minutes in length) and is usually performed in the outpatient surgery center attached to our hospital. However, due to how sick you were, the surgeon decided that it would be better, and safer, to have it performed in one of the main operating rooms in our hospital. \n\nI feel guilty that I didn’t get a chance to look up more about your condition(s) in your chart before I went and met you in pre-op. All I knew was that you had AML (acute myeloid leukemia) and that your organs were in the process of beginning to fail. What I wish that I knew before going to pre-op was that you were the same age as me, in your early 20s. \n\nI walk over to pre-op, and I see one of my favorite pre-op nurses. I glance at the monitor that shows what room each patient is located in, and she laughs at me, stating, “Well, we’ve only got one patient right now, so I hope you’re here to see him!” I see that anesthesia is currently there, so I go to the nurse’s station to talk to the nurse. \n\n“Man, this is a sad case. Poor kid.” \n\n“Kid?” I thought to myself. The nurse pulls up his chart. When I see his age, my heart sinks. \n\nShe tells me some of his history, including that he is septic and was in remission until recently. I glance over to the room that he is currently in, and see his parents sitting there next to him, talking to my anesthesia colleagues. I am quickly reminded of my own parents, who seem to be almost identical in age to his. \n\nI see that anesthesia is finishing up their portion of the pre-op interview, and that the patient has signed his consent form with the help of his mother since he was incredibly weak. I walk over and am admittedly nervous. I’m not usually nervous when I go to talk to my patients, so for me, this feeling was a bit odd. \n\nI go in and speak with you. I see that anesthesia is in a hurry to bring you back to the operating room. However, I go through my normal spiel and take the time to reassure you and your parents that I will take good care of you. During my spiel, I can see that you’re so tired and both mentally and physically drained that you can barely keep your eyes open while talking to me. I heard you discussing comfort care with your parents and the pre-op nurse before I came in to speak with you. You have been through a lot and I cannot begin to imagine the pain that you have felt and must be feeling. \n\nI asked you what type of music you’d like to listen to when we bring you back to the room. You laughed at me (no hard feelings, I promise) and said that you wouldn’t be able to hear the music anyway and that you didn’t care. I asked again, and the anesthesia attending told you that if you didn’t pick then he would be forced to sing you off to sleep; thank you for picking to jam out to Post Malone because I don’t think either of us would have wanted to listen to my colleague sing.\n\nAfter I finished up my interview, my anesthesia colleagues brought you to the room. Upon entering, the anesthesia resident informed me that you had a specific song request by Post Malone, which was “Saint-Tropez” (which I am actually listening to right now, might I add). \n\nAfter we get you off to sleep, we get started on the procedure fairly quickly. I call your family to give them an update, which they are eager to hear. Although I have quite a bit of documentation to complete in a short amount of time due to the short duration of the case, I find that I am unable to look at my computer screen. My eyes and thoughts are fixed on you. \n\nYou and I have both been on this earth for the same amount of time, but have been dealt very different cards. You were diagnosed with AML when you were incredibly young, at an age when all that you should have had to worry about was when you were able to hang out with friends next and how you were going to have fun and enjoy life. You went into remission, and I can’t help but imagine how liberating that moment must have felt. You had finally gotten rid of the sickness that took over your life for a period of time. You were able to be yourself for the first time in years. Unfortunately, that period of remission was short lived. Your sickness came back, and this time, it was planning on taking your organs, your life, and you with it. \n\nI haven’t been able to stop thinking about you or your situation, which is why I am sitting here writing this. I laid in bed in silence for an hour after I got home from work, staring at the ceiling of my room, imagining how lucky I am to be in my home while you are fighting for your life in your hospital room. I cannot begin to explain how sorry I am. I wish that you were able to enjoy life the way that it was intended to be lived. Although you are still here with us right now, from what I read in your chart and heard your surgeons say, it seems like you probably won’t be with us for much longer (I hope that I am wrong).\n\nI promise that I will live my life with intention and purpose and enjoy the little things in life that you won’t be able to enjoy for much longer. I will spend more time with my family and friends, tell those that I love how much they mean to me, pursue my hopes and dreams, breathe more fresh air, go on hikes, plan the vacation that I have been wanting to go on for years, finally take on that hobby that I have been talking about starting for several years now, try the foods that I thought I despised again to see if I like them now (I’m not looking forward to trying onions again), and more. \n\nSome of us are not fortunate enough to live the lives that we want and some of us get ours taken away from us too soon, before we even get the chance to live. Thank you for changing my view on life today. You will live on forever in my mind and heart, and I will have the pleasure to have you in my head whenever I hear Post Malone in the future.\n\nPlease make the most out of your lives for the patients of ours who were not fortunate enough to be able to do so. Thank you for reading the entirety of my post, if you had made it this far. As always, feel free to leave any stories or comments below.\n\nBest regards, RNonsense.",

    "text": "My first chest tube Over 3 years ago, on the 11th day of my residency, I got to place my first chest tube. I was on trauma floors, and had come in for rounds during the weekend. My senior had the weekend off, and I was covering for this weekend (we were a 2 man crew, with an additional ED resident who rotated with us, working 1 day a weekend; they preferred 6+1, we did 12+2). It was around 5pm, and my attending and I had signed out to the night shift, who at this time was only an attending (we now have resident night coverage at this hospital). As sign out finished, they call a trauma alert, and me, being in my enthusiastic pro-active intern, rush down to the trauma bay to receive the trauma. It arrives before we get there, but weirdly, there’s not a lot of people there, just a couple of nurses. The patient is just laying there, unresponsive. A young white male, early to mid 20’s, with brown hair, green eyes I think, with braces on his teeth. I never forgot the braces. A young man in his prime, hoping to improve himself, his appearance, his image. He never thought that this day was his last. He had a bright future ahead of him, full of life. But not today, he was pale, laying on the stretcher, as I arrive to the trauma bay. \n\nNow, at this time, my senior, who was renowned for being ‘lazy’ in the sense that he never liked to do anything that wasn’t operative, had trained me to run the trauma alerts. I was a natural, I remember my first trauma alert, a car accident, that I ran. Going through the ABCDE, primary and secondary survey, barking out things to check, things to do. Sure I missed some things, but they were small and for the most part, I ran it pretty well. He would task me with running alerts, so he didn’t have to, and would only jump in when a procedure was needed. Otherwise, I was tasked with running the alert, sticking with the patient throughout the scans (which the attending was always there, but not the senior), then staff the admission w/ appropriate consultants and write the note and orders. If it was operative, it was his. But only in the sense of the operation. He was a procedure vulture. But I was new, and enthusiastic, happy to be in residency, learning, working, cheery eyed, and happily obliged. It wasn’t until later when I was a senior myself that I really understood the breath of responsibility one could take on this rotation, and realized how short changed I was as an intern. \n\nSo here we are in the trauma bay, earily vacant aside from me and the couple of nurses. No EMS to be seen. They were probably in the lounge 20 feet away (we do have a good lounge, which EMS loots regularly). No one knows what happened, with a nurse stating that he was just dropped off with the EMS saying he was hit by a car. As I start going through the primary survey, the nurse at the head of the stretcher stated she couldn’t get a verbal response, and the one tasked with obtaining access stated she couldn’t feel a pulse. “Shit!” I think, I step over and feel his groin myself. No pulse. Unsure of myself, I feel for the carotids now. Nothing. I rub the fuck out of his chest. Nothing. I look over to the nurse across the patient, who looking at me, asks “Should we call a code?”. I look at her, for the first time (and not the last), unsure of myself, hesitant, ‘deer in headlights”. I stutter, but finally get out “Yes, call it!”. She hits the code button, and the alarm goes off, and quickly a slew of nurses and ED attendings and residents rush in as the nurse who called it begins compressions. The ED quickly gets to the head of the bed, setting themselves up for an intubation. At this moment, my day attending arrives, a big heavy set black man in his mid 50’s, round face with bags under his eyes, with a deep but confident voice and a cheery and friendly demeanor loved by the department. He walked in an quickly took the reins of running the alert from me. He directed the ED attendings to obtain femoral crash lines as he told me and an ED resident to place bilateral chest tubes. I was on the patient’s left side, where trauma usually hangs out, and quickly got the chest tube off the wall. I got a 10 blade and made a 3cm gash lateral the nipple. Using the Kelly clamp that was in the chest tube kit, I spread through the thin subQ as I got to the intercostal space. Banging into the rib, I slid above it, and praying I didn’t jap the heart, popped through the pleura. Nothing. I spread that sucked wide, then put my finger into the hole, feeling the pleura for the first time. It was so smooth, and the sponginess of the overlying lump was rubbing the top of the finger. I couldn’t feel the heart, which was good. Grabbing the chest tube with the Kelly clamp, I slid it into the thoracostomy, aiming up and posterior, just as all the texts and ATLS had taught me. The chest tube went in rather smoothly, and I pushed it in to about 12 on the tube. Nothing came out but some scant froth serosanguinous fluid. Very little. All this while chest compressions were happening, so I didn’t know what to do about stitching it in. As I looked at the tube dangling out of the mans chest, with compressions and line access going on around me, I looked over my attending and asked what to do. “Tape it to his chest sunnychiba!” he yelled, and I obliged. \n\nI looked over to the other side to see the ED resident still fighting to get into the chest, with a colleague assisting him. I then looked over to the groins, and the ED attending and resident, were tag teaming the groins bilaterally, still struggling to gain access. With syringes in their right hands, poking and prodding the groins for blood return, getting some but unable to thread the wires, they continued. They must have struggled for a good 10-15 minutes, going through multiple kits, until my attending stepped up and got access rather quickly. The line was then placed in classic seldinger fashion, and once in place, blood was given. They proceeded to fumble with suturing in the line for a good 2-3 minutes. As this was all going on, the ED team at the head of the bed had quickly and efficiently secured the airway, and the patient was being bagged by the RT. I jumped in soon afterwards, helping with compressions, as the attending continued to run the code. We coded this poor kid for over 45 minutes, and I help perform multiple rounds of CPR, before my attending finally called it. The ED grabbed the ultrasound probe and put it over his chest to see the heart. As everyone lay still, staring at the screen, the patient’s heart had done the same. Just there, not moving, not quivering. As still as the room. Everyone stops what they are doing, taking off their gloves, as I call the time of death out. \n\nI help cover the poor kid, staring up lifelessly, mouth slightly ajar, the braces on his teeth showing. I don’t know why, but I never forgot those braces. It reminded me of an innocence and youth that was snubbed out so brutally. He had some abrasions on him but looked otherwise untouched. My guess is massive brain injury, but I never followed up with the autopsy, and so I guess I’ll never know. Regardless, the attending calls us in on the briefing, lauding us for a good strong work throughout the code, despite the patient’s death. He then asked us what we could’ve done better. I quickly realized we had never placed pads on the patient, and mentioned that. Some other people mentioned other things, but those comments escape me. The attending looked at me after the debriefing and said “Sorry sunnychiba, I would’ve let you do the thoracotomy but nothing came out of those tubes”. I didn’t even give a shit honestly. I felt faded. Like things were starting to blur. That kid’s death bothered me. It really didn’t sit well with me at all.\n\nWith my shift over an hour ago now, I walk over to the computers, feeling depressed that this young man had died. “I should be excited, I placed a chest tube!”. I thought, but I just couldn’t muster it. What was there to be happy about. I just saw a young kid die. I quickly write the procedure note, trauma consult note, and leave the hospital, an hour long drive home awaiting me (this sister hospital is farther away in our county than our home hospital, which I lived close by”. Neither the drive home nor the rest of that night were memorable. \n\nThe next day, I google “__(location)__ car crash death”, and quickly come across an article describing the preceding events. I read it and my heart drops. This poor kid was walking across the street, in the cross walk, minding his own business, when he was struck by a sedan that was being chased by another car. The article then began to describe how the car that struck the kid was being driven by a man who was being chased in the car behind him by his crazy ex-girlfriend, who had followed him, crashing into his car and assaulting him earlier. Even worse, he was a visiting student or worker from overseas. \n\nI felt devastated reading this article. He was at the wrong place, wrong time. What if he left his house earlier, or the driver never left the scene and just called police. He’d have been alive. He probably had family back home, who loved him and missed him dearly, and spoke with him regularly to see how he was progressing in America, how his job or school was, if he made any friends, if he was doing anything this weekend. All those people, who could no longer talk and hear this man again. He was so young. So much ahead of him. Later on in the story, it described the driver who had hit him, the one who was being chased, fleeing the scene of the crash where he then went behind a building and shot himself in the head. He was taken to a nearby hospital, and that’s all I ever heard about that story. It was absolutely sad all around. I searched his name, and came across a gofundme a week later, with a bunch of family and friends from Eastern Europe, commenting and remembering him. I think about his case occasionally. I really wish I never had to place that chest tube.",

    "text": "There is always hope With some of the recent anti-vaxx posts, I felt like this would be a welcome change of pace. \n\nI wanted to share a post from someone in my community that re-energized me for the week. I got permission to share and I have redacted some things to keep it anonymous. \n\n“My babies did a huge thing on Friday ❤️\n\nI believe in science. We believe in science. Science is something that I have always been intrigued by. I have the Masters in Psychology and Minor in Chemistry from [University] to prove it. But this is NOT about me. I said that to say…I believe in science. And the science has been proven over and over again. It is reliable. It is valid. \n\nOn Friday our children were the last 3 children in the country to enroll in the Covid-19 Pfizer clinical trial for children ages 6 mo-11 years old. To say we were humbled and honored to participate in such a pivotal and historical trial is an understatement. We spent all day listening and asking questions about their role and place in this time. The doctors and nurses at the St. Jude’s Research Center were amongst the most caring and knowledgeable group of healthcare professionals I have ever met. WE THANK YOU for your selfless work. We appreciate you!\n\nThe importance:\nAlthough we discussed at length what this meant for the world prior to arriving, the healthcare team reiterated how extremely important and exciting of a time this was for them as well as our children. Evaluating the safety and efficacy of this vaccine will help millions of children and they played the most critical role in making this a reality. \n\nThis vaccine works. \n\nThis vaccine saves lives. \n\nAs African Americans (black people) we are all aware of the distrust as it relates to our voluntary or involuntary…participation or lack there of in clinical trials. I understand your reluctance. I understand your hesitation. But please don’t be the person that waited too late. In order to advance medicine and understand the pharmacokinetics especially as it relates to us we MUST do better and raise our hand to help our fellow man. \n\nThese thousands of children…OUR 3 children…were brave and courageous. We are beyond proud of them! The older two actually had to consent and could back out at any time if they wanted. So for them to continue throughout the entire day with all it entailed…I was beaming with pride! \nBut as the young people say…they understood the assignment. They understand the Christian assignment. It is and has always been about helping and protecting others. Love thy neighbor. \n\nThis post is to encourage someone else to not be afraid to take a stand for what is right. We ALL must do our part. \n\nGet vaccinated\nWear your mask \nProtect those that can’t protect themselves \nDon’t believe the lies \nAsk a healthcare professional \n\nThey took a stand and made history…\n[The names of the children] thank you my babies🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 Thank you Lord for these selfless little humans.”",

    "text": "Primary Care Strategies to Avoid Burnout New family med attending here, almost four months into my first attending gig. \n\nI mean it when I say I truly love my job and I feel personally and professionally fulfilled each and everyday I leave clinic, but man, **the system makes it hard to be a good PCP.** \n\nWhile I started off seeing just a couple patients a half day, this was gradually increased until my 2nd month when the floodgates opened - I'm now seeing about 15-16 patients a day, with the expectation that I'll see 22-25 a day once my patient panel is full. I inherited a lot of old, chronically sick patients from a retiring doc, but my patient panel is only about half of what the hospital wants me at; I can't imagine fielding all of the phone calls, med refills, paperwork, and various other triages with double the number of patients while also seeing more patients in the office. My patients don't like to follow up outside of their annual physical and maybe a 6 month follow up which leads to going through their list of 10 complaints they have saved up all year to discuss in 20 minutes, in addition to their health maintenance. This leads to a lot of note writing, catching up on tasks on my days off...much to my and my family's dismay. I feel like I'm working as much as I did in residency, but at least I can be home writing notes rather than on call at the hospital. Frankly, **this lifestyle does not seem sustainable.** \n\nMy schedule is currently four days a week, so that makes for long work days when I'm in the office; **would changing to a five day a week but shorter days make a difference?** \n\n**Does this get better as time goes on** and I get to know my patients**?** \n\nSome things I've found to be helpful are siphoning off as many phone calls/responses to my nurse as I can (who can be really inefficient) and converting certain conversations to phone visits to carve out time in my day to dedicate to more nuanced discussions with patients (starting statins, discussing abnormal DEXAs, etc.), but **any other tips/strategies on how to avoid burnout while still providing good patient care?**",

    "text": "Psychiatric first aid when you're not a psych The psych ward in my hospital has a sketchy reputation for keeping the patients who are supposed to be in the locked unit inside. It used to be a couple times a year you'd see the psych team slowly chasing an often stark naked patient across the carpark. I work in the lab adjacent to the psych ward and often have a front seat view of this semi regular occurrence and I have to admit have always viewed it with mild amusement probably as it was usually \"Naked Gandalf\" as he's known on a very gleeful jaunt.\n\nIt's got much worse lately though and the ward seems to have patients in much higher levels of distress than previously and the staff there are evidently struggling which I won't go into.\n\nI have been on a few advanced life saving courses and am pretty comfortable on how to deal with the majority of emergency situations in a first aid scenario before an actual medic arrives. None of these courses ever touched on psychiatric crisis and I haven't a clue how to approach these.\n\nToday I had an encounter that I wondered if I could get opinions if there's any way I could improve my response. \n\nAlso- are there any resources for medical staff in a hospital environment who need beyond basic first aid training how to respond in this kind of scenario? I'm frustrated there seems to be no equivalent to the advanced life saving for non physical crisis.\n\n\nApologies for the length of this:\n\n\nToday outside the entrance to the hospital as I drove home I saw a plain clothed man struggling to hold up a woman who looked to be having a seizure. I stopped the car and ran to help.\n\nQuickly a few things became clear- she was extremely distressed, not having a seizure but fighting him and he was covered in mud pretty scuffed up and utterly exhausted from trying to hold her. I asked him what was going on and he eventually managed to get out he was a psych nurse and could I call the psych ward. \n\nI kept a distance but helped push her back onto the pavement because it's an extremely busy road and she was trying to throw herself Infront of traffic. I started trying to say reassuring things whilst he's now grappling with her on the floor and he asked me not to. I asked him if he'd like me to leave and he asked me to please stay. \n\nAt this point concerned bystanders start stopping thinking he's hurting her so I reassured them he was a staff member and the situation was under control (he'd indicated for me to take his ID badge from his pocket to prove this at this point). Finally other random staff members start asking what's happening and trying to get involved as he just looked like a member of the public fighting this young woman so I reassured them too and dissuaded them from getting involved. I asked him if he'd like me to call hospital security but he said no. I can't stress how regularly close she was to getting hit by traffic during all this so I stand part in the road and push her back on the pavement each time she nearly succeeds whilst trying to be minimal contact.\n\nFinally other members of the ward arrived and helped with trying to restrain her- particularly unsuccessfully until someone jabbed her. During this one of them asked me to lock their car and he finally got his breath enough to thank me and tell me he was grateful I didn't leave but didn't get overly involved. They said they had it under control now and I left.\n\nIt keeps dawning on me that I've literally no idea what I'd have done if that nurse hadn't spotted her and what could I have done to try and minimise the chance she'd get hit by a car until trained staff arrived?\n\nIt's worth mentioning he'd been fighting with her a long while before I was passing and literally no one had stopped to ask what was going on or alerted anyone.",

    "text": "Why SANE evaluations instead of physician evaluations for sexual assault? Prior to starting medical school (currently MS1), I worked as a technician in a lower volume (80-100 patients per day) ED attached to a 150ish-bed hospital. On occasion, a patient would present status post sexual assault. We did not have a SANE on staff. When we treated victims of sexual assault, the end result of our algorithm was always a referral to a SANE-manned ED following our EMTALA-mandated MSE. The only thing that changed was the facility to which we referred the patient, based on social and demographic factors.\n\nEvery time I watched one of these patients leave, I felt hollow. I felt like we, as a team had failed our patient. I felt like I, as a victim of sexual assault myself, had personally failed my patient, even though there was nothing anyone could do without possible punitive repercussions. We were required to see the patient for a matter we knew was time-sensitive, but unable to tell them, per our hospital's interpretation of EMTALA, that we did not have the capacity to provide a thoroughly comprehensive evaluation of their condition beyond declaring them medically stable. In the end, we would end up wasting over an hour of these patients' valuable time because the law says so, and because none of us had the required credentials.\n\nSo, who's to blame? Well, there's always Satan - umm... I mean, hospital administration. Easy, enough, right? After all, they didn't hire the SANE nurse! So stingy! Except, for once, that's only part of the problem. My question is this: why do we depend so much on SANE's? Is there a particular reason why an emergency medicine physician cannot be trained and permitted to perform a SANE-equivalent examination when a SANE is unavailable? What rules and regulations are there regarding having a SANE on duty? Am I missing something?\n\nAny insights would be greatly appreciated. If I have things all wrong, please enlighten me.\n\nThank you!\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone who responded. I understand the rationale behind the current system a lot more now, burdesome and inconvenient as it may be. On a side-note, I want to thank all of the forensic nurses out there who tirelessly advocate for victims, sometimes at the expense of their own free time outside of work. It's truly selfless what you do, and I look forward to supporting you in your role and backing you up however I can in a few years, when I'm finally an attending.",

    "text": "Tasmanian Devil delivers a breech baby vaginally, and I lived to tell about it. I have to tell you guys this story, cause I can’t even believe it myself.  It's long as fuck.  Cheers.\n\n\n\nFor you in the OB world: tonight my meth-addled patient involuntarily pushed out a frank breech baby under conscious sedation. If none of that makes sense to you, keep reading, dear Redditor: it will.\n\nIn my 16 years as an L&D nurse, this night takes the cake.\n\n\n\nSo, coming on at 7pm it’s a little busy, but we don’t exactly need roller-skates yet…. I get report from Nurse 6th-Shift that there’s a patient coming up from ED. She presented to the ED with abdominal pain two days ago. They took one look at her mental health history (schizophrenia) and apparently decided that everything that came out of her mouth would be lies. She told them she was 37 weeks pregnant. So they did a chest x-ray, and an ultrasound that showed she was 33 weeks pregnant and then discharges her schizophrenic ass to the street.\n\n2 days later, she shows up back in the ED, and in the interim, she’s managed to find enough methamphetamine to blast her into florid mania. My report from 6th-Shift was “well, in the same 3 minutes she told me she is the Queen of Hawaii, an attorney, and that her parents owned the hospital.” Also, that her baby is alive, and that her mania turns into belligerent violence about every 5-7 minutes.\n\n“I told the ED doc that I can’t tell whether she’s in preterm labor or not because she tried to punch me.  I told them she should probably come up to L&amp;amp;amp;D so we can figure it out.” After 2.5 hours of this patient raising holy hell in the ED, they joyfully but slowly bring her up to us.  Excellent call, Nurse 6th-Shift.\n\nSpoiler alert: the patient delivered 2 hours later.\n\nTo my endless delight, the one thing that the ED doc did correctly in this situation was to order 2 mg PO Ativan, and 5mg IM Haldol. Bless his heart, he couldn’t figure out to send her up to L&amp;amp;amp;D for evaluation of her abdominal pain, but he sure as fuck could snow her for us.\n\nGood man.\n\nShe arrives curled up and filthy on a stretcher.  She is somnolent, but cooperative enough that we’re able to herd her onto the labor bed.  Just after the exasperated ED nurse leaves, the patient suddenly becomes very animated. “I gotta PISS!!!!” Writhing in the bed, clutching her belly: she is the very picture of labor. I put a hand on her rock-hard abdomen and my stomach drops to my knees.  At this point, all I know is: she had an ultrasound 2 days ago that put her at 33 weeks. In the 2 minutes since I met her, I am certain: she is going to deliver a preterm baby very soon.   Our one-bed well-baby nursery is woefully unprepared to care for a 33 weeker.\n\n60 seconds later, her contraction ends and she is snoring again (bless that man).  I swallow my moral outrage at checking an unconscious woman’s cervix, and find her to be 4cm dilated.\n\nAnd, fucking breech.\n\n(For those of you outside the OB world: Breech babies are NOT born vaginally. The risk of head entrapment is terrifying: the head is the biggest part of a baby’s body. This can quickly turn into dead baby hanging out of a vagina and that’s not a good look on anyone. So, any baby who is breech is universally born by c-section.)\n\nWhere were we?  Oh yeah: 33 weeks, breech, and psychotic with contractions.\n\nAs I jump up off the bed to start sounding the alarms, I see I now have a handful of meconium.\n\nNot meconium-stained fluid… Frank meconium. From a frank breech baby who is now pooping into its mother’s vagina.\n\nNow the score is up to: meth-induced preterm labor, breech, and meconium. This is the worst hat trick in the OB world. Fuck my life.\n\nSo, we start making plans to ship her out.  We gotta transport this train wreck to a facility that can care for a preterm baby.\n\nI call the community on-call Dr. LaLa to report our hat trick, and after her telling me 8 different ways that we just need to c-section her and ship the baby, I say “well, why don’t you (STOP FUCKING TALKING AND) head in here, and we’ll have some more information when you get here.\n\nIn the background, volume 10: “I GOTTA PISS!!!!” I run back into the room to keep the patient from tearing her IV out as she barrels for the bathroom like a bull with its balls in a pinch. I also discover that she is dribbling copious amounts of undiluted meconium down her legs, has wiped it on the siderail, and has generally made a baby-poo finger painting out of everyone and everything in the room. Pretty sure I have some in my hair.\n\nBy the time Dr. LaLa waltzes in, it is clear to everyone on the unit that not only is this lady not going to stay pregnant long enough to make it to the helicopter, she isn’t going to stay pregnant long enough to make it into surgery. Also, she is almost completely unresponsive in between contractions and definitely cannot consent to surgery. Once Dr. LaLa catches up to speed on the very real mess that we’re all in, she says “Call Dr. Crusty, whatever happens - he can help.”\n\nOh great.   Good old Dr. Crusty. (we’ll get to how he earned that name later.)\n\nDr. Crusty has two states of being:\n\n1. Look up the word “doddering” in the dictionary. His grinning face is the damn centerfold. It would be cute, if he wasn’t a surgeon. He dodders at everything. Walking, dictation, perineal repair, sharp dissection… I’ve seen him lacerate two babies’ faces in c-sections and yet still he is somehow in practice.  The OR techs give him the biggest needles they can find because he can't see the smaller ones.  He has a legit parkinsonian shuffle.  I could go on for days...\n2. His other mode is: \"8 SEMI-CONFLICTING ORDERS AT ONCE! JESUS CHRIST YOU INCOMPETENT NITWITS MOVE FASTER!\" His trauma response is to become consummate prick with snide, passive-aggressive remarks about our nursing skills that everyone just lets slide because he’s delivered most of this rural area’s babies for the last 40 years.  He reminds us, constantly, how much experience he has, and how good he is at doctoring.  That said, he is actually amazing at some stuff, and will accept chickens and lawnmowing in payment for his services, so I am conflicted about talking shit about him.\n\nBack to the scene:\n\nWe rush back to the operating room, and I scoop her onto the OR table between her wild contractions. Every 4 minutes, she becomes the Tasmanian Devil: writhing, howling, and grunting. I half-sprawl my body across hers to keep this tornado of a person from whirling right off onto the floor. Once one particular 60-second storm subsides - my dearest and actual most favorite anesthesiologist Dr. Diamond Rainbow pushes her mystical white light elixir of the gods into Taz’s IV.\n\nWe all felt a warm balm wash over us as the propofol solved quite a few of our problems.\n\nWith the Whirling Dervish asleep, we could turn our attention to more pressing things, like the half a baby butt peeking through this lady’s labia. (It was a girl, BTW. It was labia in labia. Labiaception for a minute.)\n\nI love Dr. Diamond Rainbow with every fiber of my little nurse heart. She somehow waved her magic wand and settled this patient into a sweet peaceful place: somewhere between methamphetamine, Ativan, Haldol, Propofol, Versed, and Fentanyl…a delightful rainbow of medications…  Taz was able to sleep soundly, but keep her reflexes intact.\n\nMaintaining just enough anesthesia for our Tasmanian Queen of Hawaii to protect her airway... meant she also retained the Ferguson Reflex.\n\nFor those of you who’ve never pushed a baby out: you know that feeling you get when you take a satisfying shit, your face contorts a little and your body goes into an animal hrrrrrrrrnnnggggg… and then you eject a pound and half of yesterday’s tacos? Yeah, that’s actually a reflex.  When you have a 5lb 10oz baby far enough down in your pelvis, your body knows just what to do with it.\n\nYeetus.  That.  Fetus.\n\nSo, the patient slept, and every 3 minutes would push quite effectively. I got to watch Dr. Crusty coach Dr. LaLa through a really lovely breech delivery. Out of hundreds of deliveries I’ve attended in 16 years as an L&D nurse - this is the third breech extraction I have ever witnessed.  Hat trick turned Triple Crown.  I felt like I was witnessing history, with that posterior shoulder delivery.\n\nOh yeah, back to Dr. Crusty.\n\nI’m tucked in against the patient’s hip, feeling her belly for contractions with one hand, and searching with the doppler for heart tones with the other, when Dr. Crusty yells out “Puje!!! Puje!!!” Which is Spanish for “push”. Not only is the patient unconscious, she is Hawaiian, not hispanic. I turn to glare at him over the patient’s draped leg, and see through his goggles that he hasn’t wiped last night’s sleep crust off his face. I catch his squinting, yellow-crusted gaze and mumble “she can’t hear you, Dr. Crusty. And she doesn’t speak Spanish.”\n\nAll’s well that ends well - the baby is fine, actually 37 weeks. The patient slept it all off and then ate everything in the fridge. CPS will be in later today to take her baby (also meth+ on Utox) to foster care, but for now she gets to coo and giggle at her cute little daughter. I took her an 8th cup of coffee before I left, with 6 sugars and 4 creamers, just the way she likes it.\n\n\n\nTL,DR: If a pregnant woman tells you she hurts anywhere between her nipples and her knees… it doesn’t matter how batshit insane she is.  Assume she is in labor, until proven otherwise.\n\n\nEdit: well this blew up.  Thanks for all the encouragement, guys.  I’ll keep writing if you keep laughing.  And, for the love, quit paying for fucking Reddit awards.  God bless /u/spez, but that dude doesn’t need your hard-earned money any more than I do.  Go donate $5 to The Bail Project.  If you PM me about it, I’ll send you a book when I’m done with it.",

    "text": "Dr. Careful-What-You-Post-In-Nursing-Subreddit or: How I slipped up and my post ended up on /r/conspiracy This is the story on how a snapshot of my /r/nursing comment ended up trending on /r/conspiracy, and why it should bother you.\n\nI had to tell my story because I'm a little bit bothered by it myself. Yesterday a popular thread on the nursing subreddit asked people regarding their thoughts on the omicron variant, and when an emotionally burnt-out nurse spoke out on how she found it hard to sympathize with the deaths of anti-vaxxer patients. So I chimed in, with classic morbid nurse humor, mentioning that maybe deaths would slow down climate change. Never did I think that would spiral out of control. The next morning I wake up to roughly 15 notifications and two PM's. They were all rather cruel or disheartening messages. The responses were from multiple different subreddits. One of the PMs was a man threatening to pour 1000L of Round-Up down the drain if I didn't watch what I said, because his whole family is unvaccinated, which actually made me laugh. I couldn't figure out what was going on until I saw one message in which I had been mentioned by user name was on a different thread.\n\nBehold, someone had snapshotted my comment with others and posted it to /r/conspiracy under the guise of us being horrible people that wish death upon people (or maybe that we are killing patients? I'm not sure.)\n(https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/r3pw5o/our_nurses_ladies_and_gentleman/)\n\nI found it disheartening, reading the comments. However, some of them are rather revealing. When a user mentions pizza flair, OP responds \"Not sure what that’s about, but a ton of accounts in the sub have them, including the moderator.\" It crystallized the fact, these people don't know us. These people who are so ready to besmirch us have no idea what our struggles are. But that should not come as a surprise.\n\n**TLDR**: Here is what you should know. \n\n1. There are unprecedented amounts of people coming in from other subreddits, and they want to make nurses look bad.\n2. They will take screenshot your comments and share them with their buddies.\n3. They might brigade against you, and follow you into several other subreddits. If you have some revealing information on where you live, or where you might work in your post history, you might be in danger.\n\nI have already spoken with the /r/nursing mod team, and they have been wonderfully supportive. For that I thank them. But I wonder,  will we eventually need to turn our sub private to feel safe when we post?\n\n^Thank ^you ^if ^you ^caught ^my ^Dr. ^Strangelove ^reference.\n\nEDIT: all you non-health care workers that are outpouring your support. You are all heard. Thank you for sharing your stories on how this sub has helped you. We are happy to be that catalyst for your life. I personally have felt very touched by some of your stories. Please continue to advocate for nurses, as we need it now more than ever.",

    "text": "When I say I don’t want to talk about how my day went ... It’s because I spent my day with a patient who is a DNI (do not intubate) who has been on face mask ventilation for weeks. In the moments between doses of Ativan and dilaudid, he begs “please help me,” “don’t let me die,” and “I can’t breathe” with tears streaming down his face. The mask leaves an extremely gruesome pressure ulcer over the bridge of his nose. The mask isn’t meant to stay that long. The respiratory therapist managed to find a mask that covers the whole face (I call it a scuba mask) but unfortunately it made everything worse. Putting patients in the middle of full code and DNR is the worst way to die. I’m sorry, I’m just going to say it. It’s cruel. I cannot continue to watch a grown man cry and plead for help every day until he dies.. because let’s face it, he’s going to die. \n\nNext door, my other COVID patient has had a massive stroke. She’s in her 20s. I will never forget the sound of her mother wailing on the phone when I told her that the CT results were very bad and warning her about the phone call from the doctor that will soon come. \n\nMy third patient today was a tough one. Thinking back to 3 days ago when I admitted her from the ED, she was on BiPap and actually doing ok. While doing admission paperwork, her HR spiked and I told her to calm down and take some deep breaths. She said “I can’t calm down.. just tell me I’m not going to die.” I held her hand and said nothing. Today, I came in and she was intubated. Later that day, I had to help pick her sister up off the floor when she saw her with a sheet over her face. \n\nI helped another nurse set up a zoom call for her patient so she could watch her daughter’s wedding. Hearing her cry to the sound of wedding music is another sound I will never forget.\n\nSo, no. I don’t want to talk about it tonight.",

    "text": "Patient died. Family is at fault. I'm angry and sad. I'm not a nurse, I'm a nurse aide/ safety sitter. Today I was working as a sitter because bed control needed me to. This is not the first time a patient of mine has died, but it happened today and shouldn't have. This is long. I'm okay, but I'm very angry and very sad.\n\nPatient is early 90's, only has 1 functional lung and COPD, and is NPO NO EXCEPTIONS (there's A LOT of other stuff, but this is the relevant stuff). Wife, daughter, and granddaughter are staying in the room in shifts, clearly a very close family. Doctor has brought up hospice and DNR but family is insistent that \"we do whatever we have to do to keep him alive.\" Man has to be reminded to breathe properly every 10 breaths.\n\nEverything was fine, considering, until 1645 when patient starts to code. During the code, he starts vomiting green liquid that has chunks. Even though we did everything right, he starts choking on the chunks and on the liquid that made it's way into his lungs. The doctor gets forceps and starts getting \"it\" out of his throat. It's green beans. Green fucking beans. The cafeteria had served green beans last night for dinner and today for lunch. Wife had stayed overnight. Daughter had been there all yesterday. Granddaughter had been there all today. All of them had been going to the cafeteria and getting a to go meal at some point during their \"shifts.\" One of them gave him water and green beans. A lot of it.\n\nIdk or care who it was, point is it happened. We had two signs on the door and one on the massive fucking whiteboard in the room: NPO, NO FOOD OR DRINK, NO EXCEPTIONS. We tell family that information at every shift change and everytime the patient asks for food or water. We don't do that shit for kicks. We don't not let someone have food or water 'cause we think it's funny. It's always for a fucking reason. They could get worse or even die. \n\nAfter I clocked out, the patient's wife and granddaughter flagged me down in the parking lot and asked what the response time was for the code. I stuttered out that \"our hospital staff is some of the best around\" and they \"responded immediately and effectively.\" Wife lights a cigarette and thanks me, then drives away with granddaughter. \n\nPatient died, asphyxiating on the vomit that got into his only good lung. There was literally nothing they could have done to save him. Thankfully I was home when I found out.\n\nI don't have words that properly express how furious I am. Furious at the selfishness, the arrogance, the entitlement, the audacity of the patient's family. I can't call it ignorance or stupidity, because the seriousness was made so abundantly clear to them. They chose to do that. This was completely avoidable. I'm sad, I'm fucking heartbroken, because that man didn't deserve to die like that. He didn't deserve to die scared and in pain and surrounded by medical staff instead of family. He didn't deserve to feel the pain during us trying to save his life, which optimistically had (at best) 6 months to a year. I am furious and heartbroken and appalled and incredulous and frustrated. I will probably always be angry and frustrated about this.\n\nIt's not their (patient's family) fault he was old. It's not their fault he was sick. It's not their fault his lungs barely functioned. It is ENTIRELY their fault that he died the way he did. I want to yell it at them till my face turns blue and my voice goes hoarse: THIS WAS YOUR FAULT. I want to yell it at them till they understand that THIS IS YOUR FAULT. I hope the nurses or doctors that informed them of his death made it super fucking clear WHY AND HOW this happened, but I also don't want them to be in more pain then they are already. It's confusing.\n\nI'm home right now. My boyfriend listened to me rant and cry and scream. He's furious and helped me process what happened in a loving and supportive way. Am I always going to be angry about this? I want to always be angry but I also don't. I'm sad and confused. I'll be okay, but I'm still really raw and sore.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your support and kind words. I am already in therapy, but I've taken several people's advice and booked an extra appointment for tomorrow. There was also a little confusion on why the sitter didn't stop the family. Unfortunately, a sitter wasn't authorized untill 1300 of second day on our floor, and that was only because the family wouldn't stop the patient from pulling on his IV's and oxygen. Thank you all so much.",

    "text": "I just kept working #2 ICU nurse on COVID floor. Have to get this out of me. I had this 80yo gentleman yesterday who had turned buckwild crazy during his ~7 days ICU stay. Angry old man? Hypercapneic/Oxygen  deprived? psychotic? Regardless, he would spit his PO meds out, blow bubbles through the straw in the cup, pull on any and everything, refused his PICC line until his daughter convinced him, attempted to kick multiple nurses who moved out of the way just in time, got restrained, so on and so on. He wasn't my patient until 2 days ago, but after all his antics, all the nurses knew about Mr. ------- and pitied the nurse who got him. \n\nHaldol (was seeing things and paranoid) and a precedex drip were started to keep him calm and therefore, keep his oxygen up. Despite all this, he managed to tear his Foley out. I know that happens, but I'd honestly never seen it. Blood EVERYWHERE. Urology consulted. That was the day before my shift. \n\nBy my turn to care for him, he had had 12+ hours of precedex on board and an excellent rass score: arousable but usually sleeping, non violent, steady vital signs, and we were able to keep the bipap on without him madly struggling to take it off. He was still uncooperative and in a anxious state when aroused and moaned \"please don't\" and other sad things. I tried to wean the precedex down slowly but his respiratory rate SHOT up and spo2 plummeted. So he got a rest day on my shift (report said that he hadn't been able to sleep for approx 72 hours d/t SOB and I believe it.) \n\nBy the time I got there yesterday, the night shift reported the implausible: he was oriented, compliant, out of restraints, accepting meds and care, sitting up in bed not tearing his bipap off. He's finally oxygenated! He's recovering! During my assessment, he was quietly pleasant, though still so out of breath he could hardly talk. But he was oriented. Amazing.\n\nThen. \n\nI was scanning my meds in his room when I heard his breathing change from 30's to 55's just like that. I looked over and asked \"are you OK?\" and he shook his head no. More tripoding. More work to inhale. Tried to work with his anxiety but then saw his acute HTN: 250/110. He was going into flash pulm edema. We all know that medication could have helped; treat the BP, dilate the bronchi, get stronger sedation to relax him into breathing more effectively, but after all that, intubation was a probability if not inevitable at that point. So I took that time to have that talk that no nurse wants to have, but it's our duty to have: to educate the patient on his choices--to intubate or not, to live or to die, or more realistically, to die now or die later.\n \nHe chose to call his family one last time. \n\nGod provided time I did not have to be able to sit by his side as his morphine drip infused in. I refuse to let my patients die alone. \n\nFucking. Refuse. \n\nWhen he got to the point where the morphine appeared to have overcome his consciousness, I went to turn around to wipe my tears and snot, but his hand clamped down on mine. Oh! He's still lucid! \"I'm still here!\" I yelled into his ear over the bipap. \"I'm not going anywhere!\" Half an hour later, I went to blow my nose thinking he would  never open his eyes again, but again he clamped down.\n\nThis man wants to live, I thought. He's struggling to stay. It was palpable. After an hour of this, he OPENED HIS EYES. I thought he might be seeing things that aren't there, things that hospice nurses talk about, but then he looked straight into my eyes. He was afraid to stop breathing but too exhausted to keep going. Like a man drowning. \n\nThat's when I told him, felt compelled, knew he needed to hear it, \"it's OK to go. You don't need to stay here. We'll be alright. You can go.\" Tears streamed down my face into my mask. He slowly turned his head away from me, went purple and stopped breathing. \n\nThen I just.kept.working.",

    "text": "Grief is a powerful emotion, but is it an excuse for this family member's behavior? Sorry for the length. \n\nThis is a soft rant. Meaning I'm frustrated with a patient's family but I'm also understanding because they are grieving. \n\nA couple nights ago, we had a patient suddenly go into cardiac arrest. We (the nurses) weren't really surprised because he was very sick and we had been seeing signs he was declining for a couple days. But the family wasn't expecting it at all, despite us trying to prepare them. The patient had an active plan for some imaging and tests, so we were treating him like he was gonna go on living. However, he was no CPR, so when he coded, we couldn't do anything. He was in his early 80s.\n\nHis wife wailed like her son had just died a sudden and horrific death. She cradled his head and shook it gently like she was trying to wake him up. She screamed in agony like I haven't seen before. It was breaking all of our hearts but we gave her space. \n\nI was sitting outside the room when I noticed a family member fast-walking towards the room with, understandably, a distraught but less understandably slightly angry look on his face. He rushed into the room to hold the patient's wife and I closed the door behind them to give them privacy. \n\nSuddenly, he burst out of the room and screamed down the hall, \"What did you give him?!\" and then went back into the room. I'm sure the entire unit heard him he screamed so loud. I walked to the doorway and before I could say anything, he continued. \"You guys killed him!! You gave him too much of this!\" He pointed at the word Remeron we had written on the whiteboard. I quietly asked him to calm down, flustered by the sudden eruption. \"No! You killed him!! He was fine yesterday! We never should have come to the hospital! You guys just kill people!\" He was screaming at the top of his lungs, holding nothing back.\n\nI turned around to see the patient's nurse approaching, looking distraught as she prepared herself for what she knew was coming. She entered the room and sure enough, the man screamed at her, \"What did you give him?!\" She explained that she had actually held all non-essential meds that night because he was too out of it and lethargic to safely take pills and had soft blood pressures. The man didn't believe her. She even offered to show him the patient's MAR to prove he wasn't given anything overnight. \"I don't care what the computer says! You did this! What kind of a nurse are you? You killed him!\" \n\nI had gotten the charge nurse by now and she took the patient's nurse out of the room and advised her not to go in again. Moments later, I found her crying in the hall and gave her a hug. She was crushed to hear the man saying she killed the patient, even though she knew she literally hadn't done anything but actually practiced safe judgment. The charge nurse let her go home early.\n\nI'm just frustrated now because, while I know the reaction was just out of grief, it's really not an excuse to abuse a nurse like that... The patient hadn't been to the doctor in 30 years. He was very sick, and who knows what else was going on that we hadn't discovered by then? I'm just having a hard time being understanding of the patient's family. \n\nDoes anyone have thoughts on this?",

This is a full blown rant, take it or leave it.\n\nI’ve worked CVICU for 6 years, I’ve been used and and abused for a majority of that time, and I’ve literally fucking had it. I had a patient for the last 2 days who’s had numerous stents placed because he just couldn’t give a fuck enough to take his meds or eat a tad bit better or bother working out, no. So he comes to the hospital, gets whatever surgery the doctors might think will keep him alive a bit longer, then takes out his bitter excuse of a life on whoever has to take care of him.\n\nFor the past 2 days, he’s called me a bitch, whore, retard, too stupid to go to medical school, asked to see my qualifications (which he never clarified what the fuck he actually wanted to see, like?), and told me to go back to wiping asses and have the actual doctor come back to take care of him.\n\nEveryone else refuses to take him, all he does is make techs and other nurses cry, so fine. I’ll do it, I don’t give a fuck, but I just had it today. I genuinely had a moment of why am I doing this actually? I have more than enough money in the bank to live comfortably until I find another job, nursing or not, so why am I listening to this stupid fuck of a man call me all these derogatory names while management doesn’t care, the doctors definitely don’t care, no one cares. So guess fucking what! I don’t care either.\n\nI waited out the end of my shift, did everything I had to for the oncoming nurse, then I told this slob to go fuck himself. I truly did. I told him he treated others like shit because he knew he was a piece of shit, and the only thing I wished on him was to go fuck himself. Roughly, thoroughly, and preferably with a fucking rake. I didn’t wait for his stupid ass rebuttal, I just walked to my managers office, and quit. I told her she hadn’t listened to anyone’s concerns about how this man was treating us, so it was no longer my concern how she staffed the unit. \n\nI feel good. I know he was probably in pain and it wasn’t appropriate, but I feel good. I don’t care anymore. I’m tired of being insulted while I’m peeling off shit covered gloves, I’m tired of being called a whore after having just zipped up a body bag, I’m just tired of it. \n\nSo no idea if I’m even going to be a nurse anymore, no idea what I’m going to do in a month, but I don’t care.

He’s had the police called on him multiple times and curses and throws things at everyone. \n\nI don’t want my female coworkers to feel unsafe, but my gender doesn’t make me a punching bag.

    "text": "Help with handling patient's regurgitating Covid misinformation. It finally happened. I worked my last week on my current covid unit, but am going elsewhere. Had a patient, young mid 20s admitted for Severe Covid pneumonia and hypoxia. His family had basically given him a list of things to demand from the MDs and RNs. Sits in the ER for over 24hrs waiting for a bed. By the time he gets to the unit he is requiring 10LNC and desats to mid 80s when talking. His family began bombarding the unit with calls demanding Azithromycin, decadron and to \"not to give him Remdesivir\" and to \"give him prescriptions and oxygen tanks so he could go home\" BEFORE he even left the ED. I try to explain the type of pneumonia he has, which was a waste of breath so I just went and talked to my patient when he arrived. He was an A&O grown ass man WITH ZERO COMORBIDITIES. I asked him \"do you want to leave.? Because I just spoke with so &so\" He repeated everything the family had said. Then I informed him that his condition had been worsening since he arrived and that by no means would an MD discharge him in his condition. I explained AMA and that he could absolutely leave however without the oxygen he would die. He refused Remdesivir because his family told him it would kill him. I told him that he could refuse anything he wanted to, while also explaining their purpose. Meanwhile his family is still calling and harassing the secretary and charge nurse stating that they were coming to get him out of there. He agreed to stay as long as we don't give him the Remdesivir. Only after I told him he would DIE without the oxygen probably before he got home. So basically, he was terrified and his own family were convincing him that we were there to kill him. When in reality, had they convinced him to leave I would have had to sit their and watch him be wheeled out to his death. So I know I was successful in not letting him die, for now. But I feel like these situations are going to become more common and I'm not even sure I handled this one entirely right. I just don't even know what to do anymore. This is getting INSANE. I guess I need advice? Has anyone had this happen to them yet?",

The physios tried to get him to use a hopper to stand transfer to his wheelchair, but he preferred to just swivel into his chair. He ended up giving himself a shearing injury on the heel of his left foot - he self discharged and came back a few months later to have the other leg chopped off as a consequence.\n\nDuring his admission after he’d had the second leg amputated, I was looking after him one morning and went into his room to give him his meds.

I was recently talking to my coworker who’s in nursing school and he told me that the NCLEX is in for a big overhaul with written questions being reintroduced no less. I got curious and decided to take a look see as to why they wanted to change it… [this website](https://www.kaptest.com/study/nclex/next-generation-2023/) gives us a look into why they are introducing such big changes to the exam.\n\nSoooo… in case you didn’t click on the link\n\n|According to the NCSBN, clinical judgment is linked to 46% of all tasks performed by entry-level nurses, but, recent research has identified a lack of clinical judgment ability amongst novice nurses. Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States, and only one-fifth of employers are satisfied with new nurses’ decision-making ability. In a 2011 report, Saintsing et al. reported that nearly 50% of novice nurses are involved in a nursing care error|\n\n\nAre they fucking serious? Maybe they’d have more “satisfaction” with new grads if they gave them adequate staffing ratios and unit training instead of feeding them to the wolves. I love how companies are always blaming us. As if we aren’t sleep deprived, overworked, under appreciated, abused, and underplayed on a daily basis. Screw the healthcare field man. They suck up to us when they really need us, throw us away when we don’t matter, and complain when we aren’t looking. Nurses will never be good enough in the end i suppose 🤷🏻‍♀️. this is appalling but I can’t say I’m surprised.",

    "text": "I Threw Away My Xanax I am a very fortunate human being in that I was born without any mental health issues to speak of, which is to say naturally and without outside cause, I don't suffer from depression or anxiety. It's now been two years since I left teaching. Today I was cleaning out my bathroom closet and found the Xanax I was prescribed back in the days when I would cry multiple times a day, get yelled at by admins, get verbally and physically assaulted by the kids, get called a \"bitch\" several times an hour, start trembling as I got in my car to drive to work every morning, got gaslit by a toxic principal who would literally witness a student insult me and then genuinely say \"he didn't say that\" when I asked for disciplinary actions, hear literal little boys say sexually explicit things about me well aware that I could hear every word, got a black eye from a student, lost a great relationship because I would spend every weekend in a Xanax and wine haze just to suppress my deep emotional pain and trauma, and basically live like a depressed, anxious and ill person who barely washed her dishes and spent all non-working moments on the couch staring at Netflix and not even really watching it and who'd quit all her fitness pursuits and personal hobbies.\n\nAfter the black eye incident I left and never came back. I moved in with my parents. At first I was still taking the Xanax to deal withe the PTSD of it all and the feeling of being an utter failure for living with mommy and daddy as an adult. But then when the pandemic happened and we went into lockdown, I started to know more people who moved back home, so the shame I felt dissipated. \n\nAs the months progressed, I started to feel like my old self again. I dove into self-care and became the queen of home workouts, hobbies, meditation and journaling. I applied to nursing school - stress I can handle, abuse I cannot - and am loving my studies and the friends I've made, which include two former teachers who share my story. I decided to say \"fuck it\" completely to *any* societal stigmas about living at home and have been loving spending time with my folks and my teenage brother, who turns out is an incredibly intelligent and thoughtful young man, and I almost missed his adolescence completely because I never socialized while trapped in an abusive job. I got to get my teaching kicks by helping him during the pandemic and I think having his own personal tutor will do wonders to ensure that he's academically thriving come college. (Also his sweet little romance with his adorable girlfriend is my own personal \"Riverdale.\" Their occasional mini breakups are hilariously melodramatic, as teenage love tends to be.)\n\nToday I found a half-full Xanax bottle, with my name and a 2019 date, and I threw it in the trash. I don't need it medically, and I don't want to take it recreationally.\n\nI don't know who in the thick of it needs to hear this today, but you don't have to live like an abuse victim under the guise of a career. You don't have to put the needs of the three \"good kids\" in your room over your own personal mental health. You don't have to spend every day in a never-ending panic attack. There's another life waiting for you and there's no chain holding you to that desk.",

    "text": "When the ADA Meets an Alleged HIPAA Violation I teach high school Culinary Arts at a rural Title 1 high school. I am 60 years old. This is my 31st year in the classroom and my 14th as a chef instructor. I am also autistic.\n\nI was clinically diagnosed with autism just five years ago. After learning that I was on the high performing spectrum, I had a great many ah-hah moments as I reflected upon the decisions I've made over the past six decades.\n\nAt the time of my diagnosis, I was on a large 3,500 student campus which had only been designed for about 2,500. My smallest class had 45 students. My largest class had 54. Four of my colleagues didn't even have classrooms. They had AV carts which they would wheel from one room to another depending upon which teacher in their department had that period off for planning.\n\nMost Culinary Arts classrooms consist of a class with an adjoining kitchen. In an effort to free up space, my building administration moved my class INTO my kitchen. In addition to 8 kitchen work stations, I now had 14 tables, 60 chairs, 4 file cabinets, a teacher's desk and chair, and everything that had been stored in the classroom's walk-in closet.\n\nThere were tote bins filled with cake pans, pastry bags, and piping tips. There were boxes full of decorative centerpieces and candles for when my class provided catering support. There was a stack of chafing dishes with hotel pans, a utility cart piled high with blenders and food processors, and a huge stack of muffin and cupcake pans.\n\nAll of these items had to go somewhere. I placed them on top of cabinet shelving but made sure to keep them below the one and a half foot clearance level that was required by the fire marshal.\n\nI literally piled plastic tote bins against one wall and crammed what I could into my remaining walk in closet.\n\nMy classroom/kitchen was crowded and cluttered. I was really stressed out.\n\nOnce I learned that I was autistic, I undertook some changes that were intended to reduce my overall level of stress.\n\n1. I transferred from this crowded suburban school of 3,500 students to a small rural school of just 300 students.\n2. I told my new building administration about my autism and they gave me some workplace accommodations that have really helped. I'm excused from attending pep rallies and assemblies. I am excused from chaperoning proms and overnight fieldtrips. Although there is an written expectation that all teachers attend local games, no such expectations have ever applied to me.\n3. Although I am friendly with several colleagues, I keep to myself outside of work. I don't have friends (by choice). I am not in a relationship because I don't date.\n\nMy life is very structured. I have home and I have work. At work, school law, district policy, school rules, the state instructional standards, my budget, the length of our class periods, the county health code, and the availability of tools and equipment provide the parameters within which I may function.\n\nIn order to function, I need structure. Schedules and routine impose order on a chaotic world that I don't always understand. It doesn't help that I am socially awkward. I lack the ability to understand all but the most obvious types of body language and facial expressions, I am unable to read the unspoken subtext that seems to accompany most conversations. Since I have a literal mindset, I interpret all statements literally and have a problem with understanding or even identifying when someone is being sarcastic.\n\nFor example, if someone were to say, \"I could just die for a candy bar,\" I would be confused as to why anyone would willingly give up their life for a sweet treat. People have previously sacrificed their lives in defense of hearth, home, and country. In the Bible, John 15:13 says, \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\" I am not aware of any Biblical quote (or any quote at all) about sacrificing one's life for a piece of candy. Life experience has since taught me that some statements like, \"I could just die for a candy bar\" are not meant to be taken literally. The challenge for me is that I can't always tell when someone is speaking literally or figuratively.\n\nToday I had a meeting with my assistant principal to discuss allegations of a possible HIPAA violation. I was told about this meeting yesterday. Our school nurse wanted to talk to me about an alleged violation of a student's confidential medical information.\n\nI had no idea what she was talking about.\n\nThe AP told me that when Billy (not his real name) was escorted to my class yesterday, I apparently frowned after the nurse's aide told me that this kid still had to eat breakfast. The student was already ten minutes late and with breakfast would now be fifteen to twenty minutes late. Instruction for the day's production of cheung-fun (stuffed rice noodles) had already started and I wasn't going to stop to accommodate one student since we had a great many things to do in the kitchen.\n\nPictured below is our production of this Cantonese dish.\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/MP44xZk](https://imgur.com/gallery/MP44xZk)\n\nI looked at the AP as if he was crazy. How could I have violated this student's private medical information if I hadn't said anything?\n\nI asked the AP if this meeting was going to be a disciplinary hearing.\n\n\"Absolutely not!\" replied the AP.\n\nI asked him if the nurse knew that I was autistic. I pointed out that the nurse's aide had now twice interrupted my class by bringing this student to my room so late that our kitchen production was already underway and production tasks had already been given.\n\n\"This will all be discussed tomorrow,\" explained the AP who then excused himself because he had a meeting that he was already late for.\n\nI didn't sleep well last night. I lay in bed wondering how I could have violated HIPAA if I hadn't said anything.\n\nI arrived at work this morning to find an email from the AP. The AP had asked the nurse to sit out of the meeting. He knew that I was worried and he didn't want to trigger a meltdown. The administrator told me that he'd come by to speak with me towards the end of the day. It would just be the two of us speaking and I shouldn't be worried because I wasn't in trouble.\n\nAt the end of the day, the AP came to my room. He asked me what happened when Billy came to my room. I told him. He asked me if I had said anything. I told him that I had not.\n\nHe asked me if the nurse's aide had said anything.\n\nI told him that she had told me that he had been in the health office and that he now needed to eat breakfast.\n\nHis conclusion was that I had NOT violated HIPAA. If anything, the nurse's aide had done this when she announced that the student had been in the health office. He did tell me that I ought not to have frowned.\n\nI told him that this had been an involuntary reaction. I also emphasized that I hadn't actually said anything and that my back was towards the students in the kitchen when this happened.\n\nThe AP then told me that the nurse had said that I could not punish Billy for having late to my class. He has medical issues that take precedence over instruction and I was prohibited from scolding Billy, deducting points from his grade, or doing anything in retaliation for the fact that he had a chronic medical problem.\n\nI don't know why the nurse thought that I had done anything like this. I've never even met the woman.\n\nI offered to open my gradebook then and there so the AP could see that no points had been deducted from the student's last two cooperative learning grades.\n\nThe AP told me that this wouldn't be necessary and that was that.\n\nI am not entirely sure what happened but am relieved that I wasn't in trouble.",

    "text": "AN OPEN LETTER TO EVERY STUDENT WITH WHOM I HAVE EVER SHARED A CLASSROOM: A few years ago, my brother called to tell me that he was going to marry a beautiful, intelligent, strong black woman. A woman who had served in the United States Army for over twenty years as a nurse. A woman who raised herself through various family traumas and personal defeats only to hold her head high coming out on the other side. A woman who had already faced racism and prejudice from men and the families of men in previous relationships, and yet she chose to take a chance once more on my brother, who no doubt needed to do his best convincing.\n\nAfter they wed, they had a child. One of the most stunningly handsome, intelligent, biracial, black young men the world has ever known, and the fruits of this one union opened me to deficiencies I had ignored in my own life.\n\nJames Baldwin’s essay “The Fire Next Time” had been on my reading list for some time. The catalyst for my purchase and pursuit of reading this text was the birth of my nephew and their first child together. After I finished reading that work, I put the book down. I sat in silence and ran through all of the differences between myself and my new family members. I thought of all the struggles I had seen in my life, I wondered how those struggles would translate to my nephew, and I realized then that they would be very different. I was far too old to be having this realization. It came upon me with a level of gravitas and import that should have been known to me far earlier than the age it did.  The one belief that caught me by surprise at its impact was that one day, when my nephew would be far too young to fully understand it and know the history and hatred behind it, he would hear the one word I cannot bring myself to say, or even type out. He would hear it in a song, from a friend, or even, sadly, in an attack from a stranger. He would hear it for the very first time, and he would go to his mother, and he would ask his mother the meaning behind the word, and she would need to dig deep within herself, reflecting on all her own personal experiences with hatred, racism, and prejudice, and she would be forced to look him in the eye and unpack all of it while maintaining a dignity and poise not known to me.\n\nIn that work, I came to discover what is perhaps my favorite quote: “Life is tragic simply because the earth turns and the sun inexorably rises and sets, and one day, for each of us, the sun will go down for the last, last time. Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, the only fact we have. It seems to me that one ought to rejoice in the fact of death--ought to decide, indeed, to earn one's death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life. One is responsible for life: It is the small beacon in that terrifying darkness from which we come and to which we shall return.”\n\nI always read that James Baldwin quote as one that was meant to be read stoically. The fact that we all die should offer some comfort and a resilience in the pursuits of life that are of personal import and bring us personal joy.\n\nThis is a call to action, I would say. Surely, you and I are meant not to fear death, but embrace and rejoice in it. Rest is coming, but it is not coming now because now is a time of action. I read it the same way as I did when I read Marcus Aurelius’s description of the essence of man: each according to his nature; do the things you were meant to do without avoidance. A life in fear of death is no life at all, but it is a life that we all share and we are related to each other by our natures, our ultimate reasons for being.\n\nAnd perhaps it can still be read that way. The masculine, stoic side of me would like to think so.\n\nHowever, I now fear that I have been reading it wrong. Baldwin’s is not a quote about the one way that we are unified, but it is a quote about the many ways in which we attempt to separate ourselves from one another. It is an inventory of the delineations of humanity that we embrace about ourselves and impose upon each other.\n\nToday I watched as men and women stormed the United States Capitol carrying the flag of the Confederacy. It is the flag of a failed nation, and the flag of traitors and insurrectionists. It is the flag of a people who protested for States’ Rights, but as written, they were the rights of a state to maintain an economic system that exploited and abused African men and women, stolen from their homes, and forced into slavery, the most obscene blemish left upon the Statue of Liberty.\n\nFrom the Constitution of the Confederate States, the Constitution symbolized by that flag that flew today in the United States Capitol, Article IV, Section 3, Subsection 3: In all such territory the institution of negro slavery, as it now exists in the Confederate States, shall be recognized and protected by Congress and by the Territorial government; and the inhabitants of the several Confederate States and Territories shall have the right to take to such Territory any slaves lawfully held by them in any of the States or Territories of the Confederate States.\n\nI write to you students in the hopes that you have a better solution to the divides that we impose upon ourselves through our emphasis on race, creed, religion, political affiliation, personal ethic and philosophy, sexuality, gender, and any and all other willful divisions we employ to maintain the divides between us so that we as individuals can maintain our own personal, subconscious or conscious, feelings of superiority. This is my apology to you because I did not do enough work to actively understand and address these divisions, all of these divisions, in my own time, and though I am still fairly young, my time has almost come to an end. It is yours now and it is a heavy burden, one that none older than you are envious of.\n\nI have no answer. I came to my personal conclusion too late in life. I come to you hoping that you find an answer to these divisions. And if you cannot, which is possible and likely, sadly, in your lifetimes, I come to you hoping that you are at least able to bring us closer to a solution so that the generation and generations that come after you are able to finish the work that I, that we, leave bare and unfulfilled.",

    "text": "Choosing teaching vs. other careers-are all careers as hard? feeling stuck(rant/advice) Hi guys, might be a long one here, sorry in advance.\n\nI live in a small UK village surrounded by small towns, and the most common jobs around here are care assistant, retail or warehouse/manual labor jobs-I'm not trying to knock these jobs, I know people in these jobs work hard for their money, my dad being one of them,  but my dad is a 60 year old man who works as a care assistant for minimum wage and can't get more than 25 hours because not all clients want a male carer. Despite this he is out the house from 7:30am often till 10:30pm because of all the driving and empty spaces between clients. We aren't starving but I know that's mostly because of the benefits he gets-benefits that won't be available to me. I'm worried about living to close to the povertyline, with no ability to save money or provide for him and my brother. I need a career to lift us out of it but am terrified of choosing wrong/regretting my decision and being stuck.\n\nSo I started studying a computing bachelors degree in the UK and kinda already feel stuck because of the path I'm on. I'm very new to IT and tech in general-I'm on the second year of the course and only studied art and design before this- and am now trying to look at what careers I could pursue, and have considered software development, IT support, teaching or retraining in healthcare. \n\nHowever I'm aware in IT and dev there's an expectation to always keep on top of new technology and seek new certifications and I do not have a strong passion for these so think I would find it difficult to keep up, not to mention there are fewer tech jobs near me and I cannot afford to move away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have considered healthcare but am aware unless I get another degree in nursing-which I know is a stressful degree leading to a stressful career and would likely require me to move (which I cant afford to do)-that all I can do is be a care assistant and it will be hard to support my dad and brother on that wage.\n\nSo my last possible option is teaching. I have heard mostly bad things about teaching, including poor work/life balance, increasing expectations and oversight, and poor mental health but I am also aware that in my area there are decent job opportunities, with far better pay than I could hope for elsewhere. I also am aware that I already struggle with mental health from our financial situation and lack of career direction-which would be reduced by a stable career, despite how difficult it may be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n My dad makes £10.4k per year($14.5k) but we live off £23k($32k) because of the benefits and a newly qualified teacher makes £25k($34k) minimum so it would be a large step up.\n\nI guess I wanted to know from others their teaching experience, If your own career(teaching or something else) has comparable expectations and stresses, and whether you feel this is a manageable career?\n\ntldr; I'm poor, don't want to be poor, so am considering teaching but want to know from others their experience in teaching and how manageable the stress is.",

I do not have a checking account, I have a savings account instead (it is the only account I have at this time, so that fact right there will hopefully keep this story simple for you to follow, as complicated as it all is). I withdraw the cash every week, keep a super-low balance, and I live my life via the hard cash.\n\n(If you're wondering why I am a cash-only person, it's because I just don't trust banks. And be assured that because I am a CNA I am automatically NOT a criminal because I can't get state certification, nor can I legally obtain ANY job in healthcare, without yet again passing both CORI and SORI every time I apply for a new job.)\n\nMy bank is a small credit union. My employer's bank where they have the payroll accounts is one of those mega-huge investment banks which are \"too big to fail.\" Meanwhile, the bank lobbies are all closed right now due to the pandemic, so the only option when you physically go to the physical bank is the drive-thru. Any really involved banking issues need to be handled by making an appointment ahead of time to meet with someone in the lobby, and you must go through all the screening ahead of time. So as I tell my tale of multiple trips to the bank, imagine me sitting in my car at the speaker thing and the vacuum-tube-cannister thing.\n\nWhat follows is my story of the bounced payroll check saga. Maybe it's a little wordy (a lawyer could probably pare this down by 70% in length), and for that I apologize.\n\n\\---------------\n\nTimeline of events:\n\n\\----\n\nTHUR DEC 31 -- The office was scheduled to be closed on Friday, Jan 1 for the holiday, so they instead issued Thursday checks this one time during that that one week just because of the holiday. Normal payday is a always a Friday. I didn't bother going in to pick up my check that day. It was a busy day for me, and this is only one of my jobs. I have another job with another agency. so I have two sources of income. So I told myself to wait until next week (first week of January) to go and get my check.\n\n\\----\n\nTUE JAN 5 -- I went to the home office of this agency (the one with the bouncy-fun checks) to pick up my (live!) paycheck which had been sitting there since the previous Thursday. Receptionist said to me as she handed me my check: \"Examine your check before you leave. Some of the girls have reported that their checks were short.\" \\[I know it's not politically correct to say \"the girls\" but that's literally the jargon we use in healthcare when referring to the aides.\\]  The supervisor was standing there nodding her head at me. So I opened the check right there, and I discovered that instead of 28 hours for a two-week period, it was just 10 hours. The supervisor wrote down my name and the number 18 for the number of missing hours. She said they would reimburse. \\[SIDE COMMENT: My previous paycheck from 2 weeks earlier was also 10 hours. I am wondering if perhaps this error was someone in payroll --maybe a total newbie-- just did a copy-paste of my prior pay cycle without realizing the folly of that move. Another theory I have is maybe they switched over at the end of the year to a new payroll system, and they tried to carry over all the old data into the new system, and this mirroring of the previous hours was the result of the bulk data transfer. Maybe it's a combination of both of these two theories of mine (a newbie payroll clerk combined with a new payroll system). I don't know, just spit-balling here.\\]\n\nMy check was only $137.95 (should have been well over $300). \\[THIS IS THE CHECK THAT EVENTUALLY BOUNCED!\\]\n\nI left the office, drove to my bank (credit union), and (I am in the drive-thru, mind you NOT inside the bank itself) I did NOT deposit that check into the savings account. Instead I cashed it for the full value, and drove off with the cash. My bank honors all payroll checks and government checks (not personal checks), and will cash them on the spot for you.\n\nMy closing bank balance at the end of the business day (and I do not dispute this balance at all) was:\n\n$68.36\n\nAnd again, I will remind you, this is a savings account, not a checking account, and it's the only account I own right now.\n\n\\----\n\nFRI JAN 8 -- Unbeknownst to me, a special run of new payroll checks got issued on this day for all of us girls whose paychecks of the week before had gotten shorted. This employer does paycheck cycles of 2 weeks (26 paychecks a year) so this was an off-Friday for paychecks. I just didn't know they would print these checks. So I didn't pick it up. It just sat there at the receptionist's desk in the main office for another full week.\n\nMeanwhile my OTHER job, on this same Friday, did a direct deposit of $126.38 in my credit union savings account. I didn't go and withdraw that money from the direct deposit because I was busy that day and didn't need it. I let it sit in the account over the weekend.\n\nMy closing bank balance at the end of the business day (and I do not dispute this balance at all) was:\n\n$194.74.\n\n\\----\n\nMON JAN 11 -- I drove to the post office so I could retrieve the latest mail from my PO Box. And in there I found a late Christmas card from my favorite Auntie with a personal check in it for $50 (she lives 2 counties away from me, so not only is it a personal check, but a way-the-heck-out-of-town check as well). I also found my COVID stimulus check for $600. I drove to the bank (my credit union) and when I got my vehicle up to the speaker-vacuum-tube-cannister thingy of the drive-thru, I did the following transactions:\n\na) withdrew $180.00 cash from that day's balance of $194.74\n\nb) deposited my Auntie's personal check for $50 (couldn't cash it outright because it is a personal check, it HAD to be deposited)\n\nc) cashed the full $600 stimulus check for full value\n\nI pocketed the entire $780 in cash, and went about my business that day. I knew my Auntie's check would be held for another 3 or 4 days, so I just let that go for the time being.\n\nMy closing bank balance at the end of the business day (and I do not dispute this balance at all) was:\n\n$64.74.\n\nAnd the $50 Christmas check was being held by the bank for a few days, so my \"Available Balance\" was listed as being only:\n\n$14.74\n\n\\----\n\nTUE JAN 12\n\nWhile I was busy with life, my bank (a credit union) got the message from my employer's bank (a really huge investment bank) that the payroll check for $137.95 which I had cashed at my bank exactly one week earlier on Tuesday, January 5, was rejected for insufficient funds in my employer's payroll account over at the mega-huge investment bank. All this happened without my knowing about it.\n\nSo on this day, January 12, after my bank/credit union received the bad payroll check back from the mega-huge investment bank, my bank/credit union turned around and raided my bank account to recoup their losses. They also charged my account $7.81 (really strange number!) for a bounced check fee. (I reviewed my account ToS and the standard charge for a bounced check is $7.81. Maybe it's an old bookkeeper's trick to be able to scan down a very lengthy ledger of numbers and find that one odd-ball number in the mix. Idunno, I'm just spit-balling.)\n\nThis generated a letter from the bank to me, letting me know I had a bounced check fee. The letter went to my PO Box, but I still didn't know any of this yet. (I only go to my PO Box every now and again, not every day.)\n\nMeanwhile, by the close of business that day, my account was now registering a negative balance of:\n\n\\- $81.02.\n\n(I also don't go online and check my bank balance every either. Believe me! If I had seen a negative balance in my account at any time, I would have been all over it!)\n\n\\----\n\nFRI JAN 15\n\nA direct deposit from my OTHER employer (the one whose payroll department has their act together) hit my account. It was for $67.79. This reduced the negative balance of my account down to just:\n\n\\- $13.23\n\nand I still knew nothing about this (yet).\n\n(SPECIAL SIDE NOTE -- there is a minimum balance requirement at my credit union of $5.00. So there were actually 2 different versions of the negative balance: the -$13.23, and then an adjusted negative balance of -$18.23, which of course is a difference of exactly $5.00.)\n\nThis same day, I drove to my employer around 3:30 PM to pick up my latest paycheck. They handed me TWO payroll checks. These were, 1) the special reimbursement check from last week which I never knew existed, and then 2) the normal Friday paycheck for the latest 2-week payroll cycle. The special payroll check was $248.32. And my regular payroll check was $415.08. Grand total of $663.40. (MINOR SIDE NOTE: I didn't notice at the time, but this was actually way too much money because I deliberately specify a very high tax withholding on my checks. Someone, somewhere in the payroll department of my bouncy-fun-paycheck employer reset the withholding to a lower amount, and I don't know why. But I can certainly fix that in the upcoming weeks. And so, because of this reset of my withholding, I am AGAIN suspecting that this is possibly a case of a new payroll software being used by my employer.)\n\nI then drove to my bank to cash these two payroll checks. I arrived around 4 PM. As I sat in my car, in the automobile line for the drive-thru, waiting my turn to get my car up to the speaker-vacuum-tube-cannister thingy for the drive thru, I took out my cell phone to glance at my bank account balance, and figure out how much I needed to withdraw after the latest direct deposit from my other employer.\n\nMy phone's screen told me that my account balance was in the negative by just under $20, or\n\n\\- $18.23.\n\nI didn't panic, I was merely puzzled. So I got up to the speaker and the vacuum tube thingy, and I politely asked the teller what was up with my account balance being in the negative.\n\nShe got a look and said: \"You deposited a check that bounced. It was for $137.95.\"\n\nI realized it was my payroll check from 2 weeks earlier that she was referring to. And after another few moments of polite discussion about it, she said \"My manager just told me we can't cash these other two payroll checks that you just now presented to us from that same employer. So we're going to send them back to you \\[via the vacuum tube thingy\\] right now.\" She apologized, I said it was okay. She suggested I try driving to the mega-big investment bank to see if they would honor the two payroll checks for $663.40.\n\nI thanked them for their explanation. Then I drove a few hundred yards away to park, and I called one of my best friends in the world, a wonderful woman I've known for over 20 years, and whose wedding I was in. She's a human resources officer in New York, so she is very well versed in employee payroll disputes and all the legal ramifications as well as the options for what employees can do when their payroll is messed up. (It's so awesome to have friends who work in these kind of specialty fields, and knowing you can call them and ask for advice and guidance. John and Paul were right: \"I get by with a little help from my friends.\")\n\nShe said go back to my employer right now (it was already 4:15 at that point, and the office was closing at 5 PM) and tell them what was going on. She said I should ask them if they would make good on this money by tomorrow (by Saturday, January 16). And if they hesitated in any way to make me whole again by Monday, then I should go to the Department of Labor. I asked her if I should go to the mega-huge investment bank to try and cash these other two checks that got rejected by my credit union just now. She said if I had time, yes. But in her opinion, going to my employer over the bounced check was the priority at this moment. The bounce itself was a legality that carried more weight than the rejection of the other two checks in this particular instance (a distinction with a difference). If I could financially afford to hold off on those other two checks, go to the employer immediately, worry about the other two checks later.\n\nI went back to my employer. I got there by 4:30. I spoke to the receptionist. She said: \"Wow, a lot of other girls here said their paychecks have been bouncing lately!\"\n\nI smiled and secretly thought to myself (Oh my dear God!)\n\n\"Can I talk to someone in payroll?\" I asked (very politely, not a molecule of anger or sarcasm or emotionalism).\n\nThe receptionist called human resources (which is in Connecticut for some reason!) and then after she explained all of this to the HR rep, she handed me the phone. I chatted with HR for about 10 minutes (I kept it very polite, no anger, no snark). HR said they found out several days earlier about the bounced check (their bank called THEM!), but then they were told by their mega-huge investment bank that my check (and I presume other such bounced checks) were eventually cleared. I said no, my bank said it wasn't cleared.\n\nSo then I asked \"How can I get my money for this check? My bank account currently has zero dollars in it. And the bank also refused to accept these other two payroll checks that I only just now picked up today. So I literally have no money.\"\n\nShe said: \"Maybe we can resolve this on Monday. And maybe we can do a direct deposit for you instead of a check. So I will call you back on Monday. Okay?\"\n\n\"When on Monday?\" I asked.\n\n\"In the morning,\" she said.\n\n\"When in the morning?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'll mark my calendar right now,\" she said \"I will call you back at 11:30 on Monday morning.\"\n\n\"I look forward to your call,\" I said. \"Have a good weekend.\"\n\nWe each hung up. I called my friend back. She said \"I forgot to mention: Monday is MLK day. They might not be open.\"\n\n(Awww! Man!)\n\n(And I totally do not like the idea of a direct deposit because of how much I hate direct deposit.)\n\n\\----\n\nSAT JAN 16\n\nSo .... first thing in the morning, I got up super early, gathered as many documents as possible, reviewed them, tried to piece together a timeline, and then I cam here to this message forum and posted this post.\n\nThen I made the following trips (I had to be early because ALL of these destinations were going to close by noon time because that's how Saturdays go. And so I had to squeeze everything into a 3-hour window of time). My mission was to go to three separate banks plus my PO Box. All in one outing. FOUR destinations on a rainy Saturday morning.\n\nFIRST I drove to my credit union, got in line at the drive-thru, and when I got to the speaker, I said, \"I need to make my account whole for now.\" So I deposited $24.00 in cash. This raised up my negative balance from the -$18.23 to a positive number of $10.77 (and $5.00 is the minimum balance, so I really only have access to an \"Available Balance\" of $5.77).\n\nHowever, this deposit (because I waited until Saturday to do it, rather than doing it in the drive-thru yesterday, which I would've if I'd been thinking) won't kick in until Tuesday, January 19, the first business day after the MLK holiday on Monday, January 18. So technically, my account is still in the red.\n\nI also asked them if I could have a printout with formal ledger items on it itemizing the details of each transaction. . They said I should have a letter sitting in my PO Box with the bounced check notice. I said I needed an explanation in writing detailing the $137.95, because that check is nowhere to be found in my account history due to the fact that the check never actually hit my account. I merely cashed it at the window. They accommodated me with printouts of several screen shots of THEIR database which only THEY get to see (very helpful!) showing me the dates and the check number for the bad check, and the dollar amounts of the check and the fee.\n\nSECOND, I drove to ANOTHER credit union about 6 blocks away. I got my car up to the speaker of the drive-thru and asked if I could open an account. The reason I wanted to do this is because if my employer --the one with the bouncy-fun payroll checks-- is going to continue to present difficulties for me with the cashing of paychecks, I want a separate bank account for now, so that my OTHER payroll deposits from my OTHER employer don't get confiscated anymore. This other credit union politely said that the opening of an account on a Saturday during the pandemic is not possible. They said all regular transactions are currently being done only via the internet and the drive-thru, and that the opening of a new account, as well as all other specialty banking services, requires an in-the-lobby meeting with a bank specialist by appointment only, and their bank specialists are not available at all on Saturdays. They said I should come back on the next business day, which will be Tuesday (since Monday is MLK Day, and they will not be open at all). So I made an appointment with them for an in-the-lobby meeting as I was talking with them at the speaker. I will be there first thing Tuesday morning.\n\nTHIRD, I drove to my PO Box. I retrieved from it the letter from my credit union which was auto-generated back on Tuesday, January 12, stating that my account had been subjected to a Return Check Fee of $7.81. They itemized the check (the bad payroll check) and the dollar amount it was for, as well as the check number (a 6-digit number from my employer's business/payroll account). The letter also declared that my account was now in a negative balance.\n\nFOURTH and LAST, I drove to the mega-huge investment bank where my employer has their payroll account. I presented the two payroll checks totaling $663.40, which my credit union said they were not allowed to honor this past Friday. The tellers at the mega-huge bank didn't bat an eye. They cashed them both! Hooray! I now have cash!\n\nThe only drawback here is that they had to charge me two $6.00 fees since I do not have an account with them. So I am now out $12.00 more. (I am going to request that my employer reimburse me that $12.00 in addition to the $7.81.) So instead of $663.40, they gave me $651.40. (I failed to get documentation of this $12 fee. I will need to negotiate this with my employer when they undertake reimbursing me.)\n\nSorry for the long drawn out story. I can come back and keep you all posted on the upcoming developments.\n\n\\-- IB\n\n::EDIT #4 SUNDAY Jan 17, 10:45 AM Eastern Time::\n\nI forgot one detail: it seems that my credit union has placed a 14-day hold on my payroll check --or else it has placed a 14-day hold on the funds for my payroll check. I have come to understand that the bounced payroll check was indeed honored, but my credit union is choosing to withhold the funds from me. (I am a cash-only person, so I'm not an ideal customer. I can only presume that they would treat me better if I maintained a high balance at all times.) Those funds will not be released into my account until January 26, which is exactly 14 calendar days after the January 12 date when they charged me the Returned Check Fee.\n\n&#x200B;",

Another husband left the wife and got with someone new, an engagement fell through, and with the successful doctor she ends up having a tumor and she suffers mentally so she decides to leave her relationship. This trend is disturbing to me. Of course we’ve seen this in other shows and movies. The black woman is always alone and has been done wrong. No happiness for the black women in these shows. It portrays a very negative image of black women, that we are somehow incapable of finding healthy love. This makes it difficult sometimes to enjoy a show.

See below for all the studies. What do you expect when feminsim teaches extreme misnadry, male privelge theory etc.... that feminise teachers will be like this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrevious submission got deleted by mod eventually so reposting here... still check it out as many excellent comments from men and women about their experience of this bias... many pointed out very obvious misandric comments from their teachers, some teachers even commented about their biases:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers\\_mark\\_girls\\_higher\\_for\\_identical\\_work\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers_mark_girls_higher_for_identical_work_to/)\n\nThis is an unpopular fact as it widely held in society that women and girls are discriminated against in education and in work, indeed in everything in life.\n\nNote; below is general statement, countless awesome teachers but....\n\n**Education is an example of institutional sexism. Now this data should to even feminist not be surprising... after all they call male majority and even female majority places as rife with sexism and \"male norms\" i.e. women have to act like men... is it any surprise then in teaching where 98% of early educators are female, 90% primary school teachers are female and these teachers have often studied gender studies type radical subjects at uni, and all HR and admin is female, that there is \"female norms\" being applied in education..... that the default child is a girl according to teachers? As the following data shows e.g. female teachers punishing boys for entirely normal behaviour that they dont understand; marking girls higher for IDENTICAL work, and giving higher predicted grades (despite boys objectively getting higher real life assesments) as they prefer girl students as model students and can relate to girl students better.... it is no wonder that schools are reducing play times, even removing physical education completely and replacing it with in class movement.... i.e. an entirely anti boy environment.... if 40% of boys are being drugged with aderal in some schools, do you think 40% of boys are unwell or maybe its the teachers who are shit and the system they made?**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOver then entire OECD countries globally, a large scale study showed that girls were given higher marks for IDENTICAL work to boys. OECD also showed that a boy receives 1/3 higher grade if the teacher does not know he is a boy. Interestingly this gender gap goes away when it is a male teacher doing the marking.\n\n[https://www.tes.com/news/teacher-stereotyping-means-higher-marks-girls-says-oecd](https://www.tes.com/news/teacher-stereotyping-means-higher-marks-girls-says-oecd)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/eliminating-feminist-teacher-bias-erases-boys-falling-grades-study-finds](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/eliminating-feminist-teacher-bias-erases-boys-falling-grades-study-finds)\n\nCornwell found that boys in all racial categories are not being *“commensurately graded by their teachers”* in any subject *“as their test scores would predict.”*\n\nThe answer lies in the way teachers, who are statistically mostly women, evaluate students without reference to objective test scores. Boys are regularly graded well below their actual academic performance.\n\nBoys are falling significantly behind in grades, *“despite performing as least as well as girls on math tests, and significantly better on science tests.”*\n\nAfter fifth grade, he found, student assessment becomes a matter of *“a teacher’s subjective assessment of the student’s performance”*, and is further removed from the guidance of objective test results. Teachers, he says, tend to assess students on non-cognitive, *“socio-emotional skills.”*This has had a significant impact on boys’ later achievement because, while objective test scores are important, it is teacher-assigned grades that determine a child’s future with class placement, high school graduation and college admissibility.\n\nEliminating the factor of *“non-cognitive skills…almost eliminates the estimated gender gap in reading grades”*, Cornwell found. He said he found it *“surprising”* that although boys out-perform girls on math and science test scores, girls out-perform boys on teacher-assigned grades.\n\nThe report also found that:\n\n* At primary level 85% of teachers are female. This has remained roughly the same since 2003.\n* At secondary level the percentage of male teachers has fallen steadily at first and later precipitously from 40% in 2003 to 31.7% in 2012.\n\n**It has been shown that boys and girls do better in reading when they have a same sex teacher. Just one year with a male teacher reduced the reading gap by 1/3 for 13 year old boys.

The results were not only remarkable but very disturbing, exposing what might well be an institutional suppression of the performance of male students.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qloY4OJxBoQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qloY4OJxBoQ)\n\nRelated, despite a widely held view to the contrary, in a large scale national study, women are favoured 2:1 over IDENTICAL or even slightly more qualified men in STEM applicationss but gender BLIND helps men significantly, and the latter is now becoming less commonly applied as a result.\n\n[https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360)\n\nThis could go to explain why many prominent claims of discrimination have failed as there is a perceived bias but on investigation, this is proved false e.g. US womens football team equal pay claim led to the judge saying the women were paid more than men, or women suing Google only for Googles results to show they were paying mens less.\n\nFunding:\n\nFemales given $6 billion per year more in grants by government for education despite being the overwhelming majoirty in university\n\n[https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=13620&fbclid=IwAR1zxexkrfKy5VeGcW0IC-hUy6mgUMQS4F8di\\_Eyk3ZDt2jhMVgtTcX6WcA](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=13620&fbclid=IwAR1zxexkrfKy5VeGcW0IC-hUy6mgUMQS4F8di_Eyk3ZDt2jhMVgtTcX6WcA)\n\nThere are also 11 female only scholarships per 1 male one, with some universities have 100 female only scholarships and none for men, again despite men being a minority in university, and in alsmost all courses (even in STEM technically men are a minority, its only a few specfic subjects e.g. physics, computer science that men are a majority while women are a majority in Medicine, Biology, Nursing, Psychology, Veteniary Medicine etc)\n\n**At home (similar ins school):**\n\nBoys are more likely to receive corporal punishment from their parents then girls ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952896/)).

Some studies indicate the difference is less pronounced at the home and may be non-significant in the first years of infancy ([source](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/113/Supplement_5/1952.full.pdf)), but the difference is still present in the same direction as it is in schools for most of adolescence.\n\n**Can something be done?

What was applied is explaied in detail. **Boys performance rocketed, gender gap went and girls performance went up nearly as much too.**Current system is bad for everyone but it just s happens it massively favours girls. I think it will get worse bad sterotypes about boys and now literally every other story about manspreading, mansplaining, toxic masculinty, menaretrash (real hashtag on twitter) all will not help. There is no political will... in the UK the head of uni admissions even said she thinks its a scandal no one is doing anything about plumetting uni levels for boys and if any other group it would be an outrage.... Uni of Arizona has 160 female only scholarships and 2 male ones despite women outnumbering men in almost every single degree... in the very few that they dont in STEM (not even all stem, for example more female medics, biology, vets) they are actively recruiting girls but doing nothing for boys\n\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/05/real-reasons-girls-outperforming-boys-school/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/05/real-reasons-girls-outperforming-boys-school/)\n\nTelegraph article on number of men in teaching, and techers openly admitting to sexism in favour of girls:\n\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html)\n\nI do know from my own direct experience that many young women of the 1960s and 1970s went into teaching inspired by a feminist mission to raise the self-esteem and the social position of girls. I could name at least half a dozen women teachers I knew personally in the later decades of the last century who were proud to say that they favoured girls in class to make up for the oppression of women in the past. The moral dubiety – and outright sexist prejudice - of inflicting second-class treatment on little boys who could bear no personal responsibility for those alleged (and profoundly questionable) historical crimes never seemed to trouble those apostles of equality. Men are hardly likely to become primary school teachers because they feel they owe a duty to their sex\n\nBy the same token, I can name a similar number of feminist commentators in the media/political establishment who celebrated the rise of educational attainments for girls in school as evidence that females are, by birth and nature, superior to males. As girls overtook boys in grades and exam results at all levels throughout the education system, those sisters were cock-a-hoop at their gender’s triumph – never acknowledging that the advantage of one sex must have been bought at the expense of the other. Not one Secretary of State for Education in the last 40 years has expressed concern that the [gender divide in academic achievement ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/11364130/Girls-do-better-than-boys-at-school-despite-inequality.html)reflected a worrying ethos in schools that imposed disadvantage and inequality on boys. They wouldn’t dare.\n\nAlong with the politicians, men, as a whole, simply gave in to this feminist-driven growth of inequality with the bovine supinity which has characterised their outlook for the last half century. Have you ever met a man who was fretting anxiously that his own son/s were being unfairly treated at school?",

    "text": "The US-funded (in)voluntary male medical circumcision program and its 20 million victims to date. VMMC stands for Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision.\n\nIt is a totally legitimate and totally medical procedure that is obviously done under informed consent. \n\nAccording to research by researchers and governments who legitimately refer to themselves as the \"VMMC community\" in papers, more than 6 million of such totally consensual procedures had been carried out by 2013 with more than 20 millon planned by 2016 and more than 80% of the ones completed by 2013 having been payed for by:\n\n>the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief [PEPFAR]\n\n>The VMMC program is an ambitious public health intervention. While it is estimated that close to 6 million circumcisions had been completed by the end of 2013, against a goal of 20.2 million by 2016, this progress should be viewed within the context of the recent and rapidly developing understanding of the importance of VMMC as an HIV prevention intervention (Figure 1). (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the reason for what researches refer to as \"the VMMC program\" is the belief that circumcision could prevent 60% of female on male HIV contractions without having to provide education on safer sex practices or female and male condoms. Of course, such a program is claimed to be implemented to help the people, but the justification for choosing a method that, as I will show later on, inevitably lead to gruesome human rights violations was to save money. The estimated savings were more than 16 billion in treatment costs with the VMMC program wheighing in at only 2 billion without \"demand creation\" - obviously, the \"created demand\" will be totally voluntary, organic and gras fed:\n\n>Furthermore, the choice to be circumcised involves deep-seated values, beliefs, and motivational factors that vary with ethnic, religious, and cultural identities, and must be addressed effectively to generate demand for circumcision. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/) \n\nOf course, the surgeries are not the only, nor the most effective way to prevent HIV. But with almost 14 Billion in total savings, it is the way to make the most money as VMMC is a one-time procedure that provides \"continuous benefits\" without having to continuously invest into further adherence:\n\n>Modeling studies done in 2009–2011 showed that in these 14 priority countries, achieving 80% circumcision prevalence among males aged 15–49 within five years (“catch-up”), and maintaining this coverage rate in subsequent years (“sustainability”), could avert 3.4 million new HIV infections within 15 years and generate treatment and care savings of US$16.5 billion [7],[8]. **VMMC is a highly cost-effective HIV prevention strategy for both generalized and high-prevalence HIV epidemics [7]. It differs from most other prevention methods (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis, sexual behavior change, or condom use) in that it only requires a one-time action in order to provide continuous benefits.**[...]\n\n>A major limitation of the cost studies in this collection is that they do not include the costs of demand creation nor analyze how increased spending on demand creation might affect the actual demand for services.[...]\n\n>The program faces increasing competition for declining funding for HIV prevention and treatment. The funding need for VMMC remains significant, and continued evidence-based advocacy is necessary to secure funds for accelerated scale-up from a broad base of donors. One way to do this is to evaluate the population-level impact of those VMMC programs that have already been scaled up. Another is to continue to draw comparisons between VMMC and other HIV prevention programs, highlighting specifically that if VMMC coverage reaches the JSAF goal of 80%, it will prove the **most cost-effective and cost-saving HIV prevention intervention** in Eastern and Southern Africa. In addition, it **does not require sustained adherence**, and there is evidence that referrals made from the VMMC program increase HIV-positive males' access to treatment [32].[...] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\nTotally unfortunately though, they are struggling to reach their goals:\n\n>Despite the rapid implementation and scale-up of VMMC programs and the doubling of the cumulative total VMMC procedures in the past year (from 3.2 million by the end of 2012 to an estimated 5.8–6 million by the end of 2013), progress at the country level has varied widely (Figure 3) and the year-on-year rate of growth in the number of VMMCs performed is declining (Figures 2 and ​and 4). This is due to a combination of factors: the JSAF goal of reaching 80% of uncircumcised men by 2016 did not fully take into account country-specific constraints that have tempered the pace of scale-up, **lack of sufficient demand**, and insufficient funding from a broad base of international donors (the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief [PEPFAR] has funded more than 80% of circumcisions to date). Modeling suggests that even if the current growth rate is maintained and adequate funds are forthcoming, the number of VMMCs completed by 2016 would fall about 3 million short of the JSAF goal of 20.2 million (Figure 4). (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\nSo what do you do? What is this \"demand creation\"?\n\nLet's see:\n\n>Demand creation: Messaging must be tailored to different age groups and to the cultural norms of different communities. Men aged 25 and above are less motivated to undergo VMMC. Studies suggest that we need to go beyond simple HIV messaging and present VMMC in terms of hygiene, appearance, attractiveness to partners, peer group norms, and modernity. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\nIn other terms, stigmatize being uncurcumcized as ugly, dirty and unattractive, incite bullying, make them self-conscious and ultimately psychologically break them into totally voluntarily undergoing the ~~assault~~ surgery.\n\nI mean, they totally look at the human and their needs as ~~victims of coercion~~ \"users\":\n\n>While a large portion of this collection focuses on surgical efficiency or quality [9]–[12], the bigger challenge is overall programmatic efficiency. The challenge of scale-up can be approached as a management challenge that requires addressing each element of the delivery value chain (the specific activities that deliver the end product to the user), using time and resources appropriately, and matching supply with demand for VMMC services while working to increase both.[...]\n\n>The cost of circumcision devices and other supply chain costs must be brought down considerably if devices are to reduce overall program costs. This will require advocacy as well as negotiation with manufacturers and suppliers in tandem with demand-creation activities. We recommend further study to ascertain whether devices make circumcision more attractive to men and to understand whether devices could assist with balancing supply and demand to help achieve needed programmatic efficiencies. It is also important to tailor demand-creation activities for devices in order to reach those who may already be aware of circumcision's benefits but who have avoided conventional surgical methods.[...]\n\n>To date little research has looked at the male population as a market of consumers of an intervention with multiple benefits. A market research approach, along with insights from diverse fields such as behavioral economics and anthropology, can provide new tools to inform the development of new approaches. More funding should be allocated to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the many approaches to creating and mobilizing demand. Those that show positive results should be taken to scale. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\nBy now, by the way, we are in the next stage and already target boys down to the age of 10 (and below, as I will show later on): \n\n>It is important to begin strategizing for the sustainability phase that should follow the present “catch-up” activities. It will take time to determine the best approach to sustaining high MC prevalence in each country, develop global and national frameworks, secure resources, and implement long-term programs. Since the cohorts prioritized in the sustainability phase will likely be some combination of uncircumcised boys (aged 10−14 years) and infants (aged 0−60 days), it will also be important to explore how best to reach young adolescents and parents of infants, taking into account impact, cost, the feasibility of scale-up, cultural acceptability, and other factors. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\nSo let's look at some actual approaches for ~~coercing~~ promoting ~~mutilation~~ demand.\n\n>Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) programs in Africa have significantly altered social norms related to male circumcision among previously non-circumcising groups and groups that have practiced traditional (non-medical) circumcision. One consequence of this change is the stigmatization of males who, for whatever reason, remain uncircumcised. This paper discusses the ethics of stigma with regard to uncircumcised adolescent males in global VMMC programs, particularly in certain recruitment, demand creation and social norm interventions. Grounded in our own experiences gained while conducting HIV-related ethics research with adolescents in Kenya, we argue that use of explicit or implicit stigma to increase the number of VMMC volunteers is unethical from a public health ethics perspective, particularly in campaigns that leverage social norms of masculinity. (https://academic.oup.com/phe/article-abstract/14/1/79/6134846)\n\n>The objective of this study was to explore norms of masculinity and the decision-making process among Luo young men to provide a better understanding of how circumcision and masculinity relate to cultural norms within this community. The methodology consisted of eight FGDs with male peer groups and 24 in-depth interviews to elicit young men's perceptions of masculinity and voluntary medical male circumcision. Findings from thematic analysis reveal that young men described several key characteristics of masculinity including responsibility, bravery and sexual attractiveness. For some young men, voluntary medical male circumcision has embedded itself into cultural norms of masculinity by being a step in the transition from boyhood to manhood and by being a marker of some of these masculine characteristics. In the case of voluntary medical male circumcision, there may be opportunities to integrate other programming that helps men transition into healthy adulthood.(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345920045_Integration_of_voluntary_male_medical_circumcision_for_HIV_prevention_into_norms_of_masculinity_findings_from_Kisumu_Kenya)\n\n>There is a need to identify key barriers and facilitators to VMMC uptake in priority countries to improve uptake. In this paper, we report findings from a systematic review of the barriers and facilitators of VMMC uptake, comparing them across countries in order to provide programmers critical information to design effective VMMC uptake interventions. Our review followed PRISMA protocol. Twenty three articles from 10 of the 14 priority countries were included. The top three barriers cited were: MC negatively perceived as being practiced by other or foreign cultures and religions, fear of pain caused by the procedure, and perceptions of VMMC as not helpful/needed. The top four facilitators cited in most countries were: Belief that VMMC reduces health risks and improves hygiene, family and peer support of MC, and enhanced sexual performance and satisfaction.(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324780087_Systematic_review_of_barriers_and_facilitators_to_voluntary_medical_male_circumcision_in_priority_countries_and_programmatic_implications_for_service_uptake)\n\nNote that \"peer support\" and \"peer educators\" are very euphemistic terms, given what they actually describe:\n\n>Many circumcised respondents, especially the younger men, relayed stories of peer-influence in their decision to get circumcised:\n>\"*There was a friend of mine who had decided to go for circumcision and told me, ‘Let’s go and circumcise. How can we continue like this and let other people ridicule us?’ The fear of ridicule from age-mates [already circumcised] influenced our decision.*\" (Circumcised man, age 35)\n>Similarly, some uncircumcised men in the more peri-urban areas, said they would be more likely to “go for the cut” if their peers had been circumcised. [...] Social network influences on VMMC uptake are relatively unexplored [28], although the use of peer educators is widespread in VMMC programming. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011674/)\n\nStudies with these populations have exposed numerous problems, for example the fact that the ~~victims~~ \"clients\" have to be turned in by certain groups of \"mobilizers\" and \"peer educators\" for them to collect money that was put on their heads:\n\n>For mobilizers especially, monthly remuneration (and their future employment) depends on referring enough clients to the clinic each week; failing means earning less, regardless of the amount of time and effort invested in mobilization. From our interviews we learned that while most mobilization supervisors receive a base salary from their IPs regardless of the targets, other lower-level, subcontracted “associate” mobilizers or “peer educators” only receive payment by providing clients and meeting targets. [...]. (This and following quotes without links are from here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337027391_Voluntary_medical_male_circumcision_for_HIV_prevention_among_adolescents_in_Kenya_Unintended_consequences_of_pursuing_service-delivery_targets)\n\nOne mobilization supervisor said:\n\n>And you know, when there are zero clients cut, all the pressure comes to the mobilization supervisor because the surgeons will be saying, ‘We are ready to cut, where are the clients?’ So the buck stops on me as the mobilizer; so it is not a very easy task.\n\nAnother:\n\n>Likewise, a 30-year-old, female mobilization supervisor offered, “We bank on schools so much. And now, when they are taking their exams, you can’t pick a child from school [. . ..] . . .when schools are so engaged, then definitely I will not meet that target” [Mobilizer 4].\n\nThe pressure to meet targets leads to numerous ways of coercing, pushing or otherwise making people undergo the procedure:\n\n>Data collected during interviews and observations suggest that the drive to meet targets may lead some VMMC mobilizers to use misleading or otherwise questionable mobilization practices to increase the number of adolescents they can refer for circumcision. As Mobilizer 1 explained: \"*Another thing is the peer mobilizers, yeah, someone wants to meet his or her targets and that is the time that they engage in what I called the uncouth methods, whereby the end justifies the means; whichever means that can make those clients come out. So you end up having the clients coming, but they are not coming for the VMMC the way we want it. They have been pushed; they have been coerced. . .yeah. This one is happening because of these targets. So that is the downside of the targets.*\" These practices are sometimes blatant: during one door-to-door village mobilization, the mobilizer kept referring to himself as “doctor” although he had no medical training. Another mobilizer, a 38-year-old male who referred to himself as a “VMMC champion” explained how he pays boys to help him mobilize their friends: \"*For us we are calling it ‘broking [brokering] system’. So after the exercise, you tell him to go. . . and convince a friend and bring a friend. . . [. . .]. For me I am using my own system being that we are not even allowed to give children money. But for me, because I have a target, and if I get my target, I am expecting 10800 KES [108 USD]. So I do divide this 10800 KES; maybe if he brings me two boys, I can give him up to 50 KES. I can even give out 100 KES [1 USD]. The moment I give that money, 50 bob, to that boy, he is going to bring me more four boys. So the more he bring boys for instance if they are four, I give 100–150 KES. At the end of the day, I will hit my target*\" [Mobilizer 5].\n\nThey also perform skits in which they try to stigmatize foreskin:\n\n>Other times, these practices are subtle and easy to overlook. During a promotional skit in which mobilizers played the roles of a husband, wife, and brother all discussing VMMC, the message to the audience was one of strong female preference for circumcised men. The wife told her husband, “Go and cut your firimbi [whistle] . . . go and remove that sleeve of a sweater. That whistle is not going inside me. . .don’t blow the whistle inside me. I have refused. . .. I am not giving you [sex].” Later, when the husband’s brother arrived, he explained that his wife is refusing to have sex. In response, his brother said, “I was passing here to tell you to go for circumcision. Look at me, I have gone, and I am fine. I am now a clean person.” Explaining the benefits, his brother offered that MC reduces HIV risk by 60% and enhances cleanliness (“you avoid smelling”) and prevents cervical cancer.\n\nThat being said, I want to explicitly distance myself from the author's statements claiming this to be \"subtle\" and even framing it as merely \"unbalanced humor\" later on:\n\n>While we recognize that the promotional skits used during VMMC “roadshows” use humor and dramatize promotional messages to accentuate the positive, greater efforts should be made to ensure that this messaging is balanced so that benefits and risks are neither over- or understated. For similar reasons, the practice of public health workers persuading boys to become circumcised by claiming that their future female partners will definitely prefer them that way (and reject them if they are not) [45] should be questioned if not discouraged.\n\nI strongly disagree. As long as uncircumcised men are in any way stigmatized, the resulting willingness to undergo such a prcedure may not actually be based on personal preferences rather than an attempt to avoid social sanctions. In fact, the abovementioned alterations of social norms may act as a coercive force even if these practices were completely abandoned, let alone only \"balanced\". It doesn't surprise me though, given that according to netflix, telling men with small dicks to go kill themselves already is \"balanced humor\". Outsourcing the coercion to peers does not change the inherent conflicts associated with not wanting to get circumcised whilst not wanting to get bullied or even attacked for being incorrectly held responsible for all HIV infections that will inevitably occur until education and supply of proper prevention methods is ensured.  You can stop claiming to be a doctor, you can stop using material incentives to persuade those who are easy to manipulate - but you can't just revert the social changes and misinformation (as shown later: only uncircumcised men contract HIV; the only prevention method is circumcision) which induce the creation of pressure by people whom you have no control over. The damage is done and may be irreversible. \n\nAnother way of coercion is paying them with food and clothing:\n\n>According to interviewees, food, money, water, sanitation, clothing, and other basic needs are issues of concern for many adolescents’ households. During health talks, some mobilizers emphasized the incentives that boys will receive (e.g., sodas and/or new underwear) following circumcision—items that may be significant inducements among impoverished children. During a village mobilization effort, one mother explained her reluctance to let her son be circumcised: “. . .*this one is small. Even his heart was there because those who have come from circumcision are ‘seducing’ their friends to go also. They are telling them, ‘go and it is not painful.’* [OP: Remember boys are paid to seduce their friends.]  *They are also giving people sodas. So that soda is what brings them nearer. I told this boy not to sneak, but to wait and I will take him there*. . ..” Offering a similar analysis, Provider 3 told us: \"*Sometimes they also entice them for us; in the facility we give them a bottle of soda, Fanta to be specific because one, some of the boys come probably from poor families, they haven’t had a meal in the morning or breakfast and sometimes stay in the clinic for more than two hours, three hours and thus to maintain their sugars. [But] that one [soda] becomes a bait, especially for the young ones ‘We will give you a soda; we pick you with a vehicle’ . . .which is actually wrong because, it is like enticing a client which you are not supposed to, but that is how they [mobilizers] ply their trade.*\" However, according to our interviewees and as we observed first hand, clinics sometimes lack sodas and/or underwear to give to clients.\n\nA common theme here is the incitation of social stigma and peer pressure:\n\n>All six of the teachers we interviewed recognized social pressure as a primary motivator for MC among adolescents. During observations of mobilization activities, we saw firsthand how mobilizers sometimes make use of or encourage peer pressure to promote circumcision, including through the use of abusive and/or stigmatizing language. During a health talk in front of a large group of boys at a primary school, one male mobilizer referred to foreskins as the “sleeve of a sweater” and “cold matumbo” [boiled goat intestines]; at the end of the talk, he implored those who still had their “whistles” to have them removed. He also told them: “Those who are still having the foreskin, you are the ones who are going to spread the diseases. In the future, you are the ones who are going to spread the HIV virus.” Later that same day, the mobilizer asked a large group of older students,“How many of you wish to get the HIV virus? If you don’t want to get the HIV virus, the only option is to remove the foreskin.” Revealing his awareness of this type of language and messaging within VMMC mobilization, Provider 3 explained: \"*This is demeaning and they try to create some peer pressure. Like when you go to those mass cuts in high schools, probably they registered like 100 clients, you would likely get another probably 30 or so who, because of the peer pressure, just jump into it. But if it was like walking from home to hospital and demanding for the service, they are not likely to have gone. But now that it is here, and so and so has gone and is my friend, I have to be in it.*\"\n\nUnfortunately, the quality of the provided \"surgery\" is lacking as well:\n\n>Under pressure to meet targets, some Clinical Officers and other VMMC medical staff find ways to speed up the clinical process. For example, as we were told during interviews and observed firsthand at multiple VMMC facilities, providers may opt not to take patient medical histories or conduct preoperative examinations (e.g., blood pressure, weight, preexisting conditions, etc.) and/or 30-minute post-operative check-ins, and yet fill in the requisite forms as if these activities had been completed. Other avenues for time-saving include rushing circumcisions, inadequate stitching, splitting surgical utensil and bandage packs between patients, not following recommended protocols or procedures (e.g., the dorsal slit method for circumcision), and stacking patients one after another with little pause in between, which raises additional sanitary and privacy concerns. According to an experienced VMMC surgeon: \"*We cut a lot of corners and I will give you an example: [. . .] so because of speed, you find that while one client is dressing [after circumcision], the other one is [already] undressing. Ideally, it is supposed [to be] that you finish with this client, you give [them] instructions on how to take medication and all that, but because of the high volume, you find that some of us we are not the ones giving out the medication. We assign somebody randomly, you know, who will be giving out the medication and the refreshment and so [the] information [they provide to the client] may not be correct. [. . ..] Sometimes even the vitals of post-operation 30 minutes after [circumcision] are not done. It is skipped, or somebody else does [it]—probably a receptionist who is nonmedical, just to fulfill the requirements of the form. [This] is wrong because you are supposed to do the circumcision and the client rests for 30 minutes in a bed or a couch, then after that, you do the vitals then you discharge. Oh, even the wound care instructions, [that] information may not sink in for the client because it is presented so fast and there may not be [time] for questions. Yeah, there are so many corners we cut. [. . ..] . . .at a clinic last year, I saw them hold that yellow form [medical files] and going through [and just] check, check, check. . . adding blood pressure, adding all these things, just filling them in [without actually measuring blood pressure, etc.]*\". [Provider 3]. One assistant surgeon, a 25-year-old female nurse, claimed her record time for completing a circumcision was six minutes. She too associated VMMC targets with client overload, and with rushing surgeries and an increase in adverse events. She explained: \"*Sometimes you compete cutting clients and the clients are too much. The average time for a client’s [circumcision] is between 12 to 20 minutes. So when the clients are too much, and you want to meet your targets, you will perform the surgery a bit fast. So upon that you will have [an] adverse event and maybe a child will come back with a bleeder [an oozing artery or other blood vessel] you did not close [suture] well*\" [Provider 4].\n\nAnd finally, the guidelines to not accept boys under the age of 10 are regularily ignored:\n\n>Current VMMC for HIV prevention guidelines and national protocols approved for use in Kenya require that adolescent clients must be at least ten years of age.[16] Despite this directive, interviews and observations confirmed that VMMC staff sometimes mobilize and circumcise boys who are under ten years of age in order to boost their numbers to meet targets. When asked about potential links between targets, mobilizer strategies, and underage circumcision, Provider 3 offered: \"*Yes, they bend the rules. . . because you know sometimes our current age according to WHO is 10 years and above. But when they [mobilizers] go to the field and get a nine-year-old for example, they coach this client and the parent, because we insist on seeing the con-sent. We always insist they put the ID and telephone number of the parent [on the consent form]. When they come to the facility, we [call to] confirm the age and whether the parent has consented for the child to be circumcised. And you know, they will tell you ‘yes I am 10 years old’, but when you look at the guy, he is probably 8 or. . .*\" . We observed evidence for the mobilization of underage boys at ten of the 14 VMMC facilities we visited for observation, including boys (and their mobilizers) who readily admitted that they were underage.\n\nThese findings are in line with other research, showing that consent is undervalued and that uncircumcised men report higher rates of depression and a lower quality of life - which you are free to attribute to anything but the incitation of stigma, if you like:\n\n>We identify gaps in the consent process and poor psychosocial outcomes among a key target group: male adolescents. We assessed compliance with consent and assent requirements for VMMC in western Kenya among males aged 15–19 (N = 1939). We also examined differences in quality of life, depression, and anticipated HIV stigma between uncircumcised and circumcised adolescents. A substantial proportion reported receiving VMMC services as minors without parent/guardian consent. In addition, uncircumcised males were significantly more likely than their circumcised peers to have poor quality of life and symptoms of depression. (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334897740_Consent_Challenges_and_Psychosocial_Distress_in_the_Scale-up_of_Voluntary_Medical_Male_Circumcision_Among_Adolescents_in_Western_Kenya)\n\nOthers have questioned the way the 60% figure is used as well as understood by patients (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261870976_The_ethics_of_claiming_a_60_reduction_in_HIV_acquisition_from_voluntary_medical_male_circumcision).\n\nBy december 2019, about 19 million boys and men had been victimized:\n\n>To date, the U.S. President’s Emergency\nPlan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has supported nearly 19 million VMMCs to protect men and boys\nin east and southern Africa. (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338220761_Guide_on_High-Impact_Practices_to_Create_Demand_for_Voluntary_Medical_Male_Circumcision_Services)\n\nWith other sources claiming it to have been 23 million in 2018 already (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344199074_A_New_Tuskegee_Unethical_Human_Experimentation_and_Western_Neocolonialism_in_the_Mass_Circumcision_of_African_Men).\n\nGuides have stressed the importance of encouraging \"peer-to-peer demand creation\" (which is of course not bullying, nor mobilizers hiring hitboys to \"bring them boys\" for cash, as we know...), setting targets to boost performance (well...), recruiting exclusively satisfied patients to \"dispell myths\" (which unsatisfied patients can't, apparently) and to promote and integrate the program into highly misandristic traditions of mutilation as an initiation to becoming a  \"man\" (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338220761_Guide_on_High-Impact_Practices_to_Create_Demand_for_Voluntary_Medical_Male_Circumcision_Services) - beliefs akin to those that have resulted in some of the most barbaric traditions around public displayals of forced sexual torture (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324477813_Forced_male_circumcision_and_the_politics_of_foreskin_in_Kenya).\n\nIn the end, it is undeniable that the \"voluntary\" in VMMC was a naive ideal at best, and a lie at worst. Other ways to address the issue were present: Education on safer sex practices and rarely known devices that are accessible to couples in which the man has penile (surgery) scars, lower erectile performance or other variations in shape and anatomy of their primary genitalia - such as female condoms, as well as the distribution of such devices are just one example. After all, if these misguided attempts wouldn't have changed societal norms and stigma to a state that makes it practically impossible to differentiate between choice and coercion, nobody would stop anyone from providing accurate information on and a safe execution of voluntary circumcisions.",

    "text": "\"Why were women treated so horribly throughout history?\" Found [here](https://www.quora.com/Why-were-women-treated-so-horribly-throughout-history)\n\n\n\"Ever hear the Story of Paul Revere? Utter bullshit - the only reason anyone even remembers his name today is because it was easy to rhyme. Revere was one of several riders and he was captured nearly as soon as 'the ride began', among a great many other discrepancies.\n\nEver hear how Thomas Edison invented the light bulb? Also bullshit - the electric light bulb had been around longer than Edison had been. All he really came up with was the screw base and a slightly improved vacuum technique. Oh, and furniture made from concrete\n\n.\n\nNearly all the crap you hear about women being treated like shit throughout history is pure Feminist propaganda. Unlike most Feminists, I'm not only old enough to have personally lived through some of the 'Dark Ages', but also knew my great-grandparents quite well - what I haven't experienced first-hand, I've experienced far closer to the source than most others.\n\nBottom line to the entire equation is that society is built to serve biology, and only women are capable of giving birth.\n\nPicture a neolithic hunter/gatherer society, where your principle source of protein are animals large enough to kill you faster than you can blink. Who, logically, would you send to try to take down something like a mammoth?\n\nWould you send the children to go fight one of these things? Of course not. Women are quite capable, yes, but there are babies to care for and what do babies eat? They don't - they nurse. Mother dies, kids die. And what of pregnant women? Could you see a woman steelworker on the job within a week of her due date?!? Odds are that she's barely able to walk. (Assuming a single birth - what if it's twins or triplets?)\n\nNo, you're going to send the men. Once the pregnancy is underway, the man can die and nothing changes - everything depends on the woman's survival.\n\nThroughout history and across cultures, [last stands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_stand) were fairly common - the women would lead the children and elderly away from danger while the men prepared to meet their own deaths in the slim hope that their sacrifices would buy sufficient time for the women to get everyone else to safety.\n\nAnd let's not forget the [Birkenhead Drill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_children_first)\n\n- during the 1912 sinking of the Titanic, men were shamed, assaulted, and even killed for daring to board the lifeboats while women and children remained in danger. Some exception was made for men who accompanied their wives and children, though many of these men gave up their seats to other women and kissed their wives goodbye knowing they were soon to die.\n\nNot only are there deeply embedded social strictures against fighting someone significantly weaker than yourself (which mostly applies to men and mainly benefits women) but men have near always been taught from youth to never hit a woman - \"even if she has it coming\".\n\nThink not? Look no farther than [Carrie Amelia Moore Nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Nation). \n\nHad any man come into a saloon wielding an axe, he'd have been shot dead before he took three steps. Carrie Nation, on the other hand threw stools into bars, shattered casks with her hatchet, and smashed men's faces in with her Bible, singing hallelujahs as she went. She was arrested on a few occasions, but no man ever dared raise a hand against her.\n\nDo you honestly see much \"women being treated horribly\" going on here?\n\nLet's say you're a computer tech - you've been building and troubleshooting computers since you were a kid and you're familiar with every operating system from CP/M to Windows 10 and most every flavor of Linux. Maybe you've even actually designed a microprocessor.\n\nDad thinks \"RAM Disk\" is how you install software on a computer and Mom thinks the 'Scuzzy' port is part of the computer that really needs cleaning. But their computer is on the fritz and they have important work to do with it.\n\nIDEALLY, if you had scads of time and the patience of ten Job-s, you'd walk them through everything step-by-step, explaining everything as you go, teaching them how to track down what went wrong, how to fix it, and how to keep it from happening again. Much more probable, you'd push them aside and do it yourself - getting the job done better, faster, and with far less frustration than delegating the task to them.\n\nSuch was the case through most of human society. Men were expendable, so they're the ones who took the risks in exploring, early commerce, and so forth. When civic affairs came up, they were the ones who had seen the enemy with their own eyes, knew the lay of the land, and had been taught from youth how to capitalize on what advantages they could. They were the ones to brave weather and bandits along wandering trade routes in order to bring back exotic oils for their wives and novelties for their children.\n\nUntil the industrial age, nearly all employment was onerous back-breaking work beyond the scope of what women were capable of. Furthermore, living standards had evolved to the point where a housewife spent 6-12 hours per day simply maintaining the home. If you've ever had to wash a load of laundry by hand, you'd understand why most historians regard the automatic clothes washer to be the most liberating advance in the history of women. Add better home heating (eliminating the need to spend an hour per day cleaning soot from the walls), grocery infrastructure (no need to maintain your own cow for milk or chickens for eggs), and countless other innovations - all invented by men, I might add - women were empowered with 4-8 hours per day to pursue their own interests.\n\nLooking back through a historical lens, it's worth noting that women's suffrage came about in each society almost the exact same time that society reached this same technological standard. It's also worth noting that only a small minority of women actually wanted voting rights - most actively objected to voting rights because they feared it would mean giving up some portion of their special protections and privileges. (See Carrie Nation, above.)\n\nAlso worth noting is that the voting age was later lowered from 21 to 18 in response to protests arising from the Vietnam War - young 18-20yo men were being sent overseas to die by a government in which they had no voice. Laws might not always keep up with changing times, but it's not through lack of effort.\n\nThroughout much of the 19th and 20th centuries, women had special access to resources men didn't. An old widow woman could walk into the grocers to pick up a carton of eggs, loaf of bread, and quart of milk and walk out without paying. When women enjoyed public entertainments, some man or other was expected to pay her way or she was admitted without charge.\n\nPart of why women used to be paid less than men was due to the above - they had fewer expenses and actually needed far less money than men (who were expected to pay on behalf of women). The other part is that employees used to bid for how low of wages they would work and, in the process of underbidding men, took over quite a number of once-male-dominated professions.\n\nThroughout most of history, however, birth control was virtually non-existent - having sex meant a high probability of pregnancy and (unlike today) no one in their right minds would even consider the possibility of willingly terminating a pregnancy. It was simply 'the wages of sin', though societal norms also forced the child's father to provide for the woman's every need. (In fact, it became standard practice for women to seduce men and become pregnant to force a man to marry and provide for her.)\n\nOne can never properly evaluate history through a modern lens. To quote Mark Twain:\n\n    The past is a whole other country - they do things quite differently there.\n\nWhile some aspects may seem far less appealing by today's standards, human society has nearly always valued women over men. Rights, responsibilities, and privileges were seldom the same, but they were usually pretty close to equal.\"",

    "text": "Why as a man, am I never asked permission if a woman (usually a nurse) can observe an intimate procedure that involves me undressing? I have had the unfortunate experience of having had several medical procedures done to me before my 30's. \n\n1. Colonoscopy (required me to be undressed from the waist down)\n2. Cystoscopy (undressed from the waist down and fully exposed genitals)\n3. Circumcision for medical reasons (undressed from the waist down and fully exposed genitals)\n\nAll three of these procedures were performed by male doctors, but for all three procedures there were female nurses present. I was ***never once*** asked if I was okay with having them present, I was never given an option for a male nurse, I never consented to having them watch. \n\nNow, full disclosure, I actually didn't care that these female nurses were involved in these procedures and would have consented but how could they have known that without asking me? Why is consent for intimate procedures involving members of the opposite sex usually just assumed for males? \n\nFor the cystoscopy, I was told to fully undress from the waist down and hop on the table. I was ***never given any privacy*** to do this and while undressing there was a female nurse just standing off in the corner. She was present during the entire procedure but never one actually assisted in the procedure, she was just there..... Never ONCE was I asked if this was okay. \n\nFor the circumcision, again, the female nurse was there and for about 90% of the procedure she just stood there and watched. It was a bit awkward having her just stare at my member for like 30-60 minutes while doing nothing. I understand that she was probably there just in case something went wrong to help the doctor, but again, consent was just assumed. \n\nHow should I address this going forward? Like I said, I actually am okay with the female nurses, I know they are professionals, but I would really appreciate being asked if I consent to having opposite sex nurses involved in the procedure because I am quite certain that women are often offered this. In fact, I think most male doctors specifically bring female nurses with them for these procedures for women specifically as same sex chaperones  \n\nWe keep moving in this weird double standard direction where if a transwoman enters a female bathroom its a travesty but transmen entering a male bathroom is something we just have to live with. Men's right to privacy and medical autonomy with regards to intimate procedures are never taken seriously but heaven forbid a male nurse doesn't ask a woman a million times if he can do a procedure lest he be sued into oblivion and never work again.",

    "text": "I'm frustrated with how men & the men's right movement are protrayed and initiatives for \"equality\" systematically ignoring men's issues (discussion) Hey so this sort of a vent post but I'm not familiar with other subs that could allow for discussion about it though this kind of post is somewhat common here so feel free to ignore. (will gladly remove if not appropriate)\n\nThis is a new account as I used my 5yo main account to visit and semi-regularly engage here but some other subs ban you if you post here. It's already telling that I need another account to engage in here, I don't imagine big active subs pre-emptively banning an user because they participate in a women's rights sub, or people trying to invalidate what an user has to say because they stalked their account history and found out they participated in a women's rights sub. Anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm making this post because I'm honestly really tired with how men, and to another extent men's rights activism, are portrayed in our society. It has already been bugging me for a while which is one of the reasons I visited this sub in the first place, but it seems everytime the topic of gender equality is on the table it is automatically assumed that women are the losers/oppressed and men are the winners/oppressors.\n\nI basically never watch TV because most of the stuff is garbage but today I went to a friend's place and he had his on. On the news I saw that today president Macron was inaugurating a forum named \"Génération Egalité\" (literally \"Generation \\[of\\] Equality\"), and I didn't know about it so I listened. The news briefly explained that it was about egality between men and women and how Macron talked about women's rights, feminism, etc. Okay fair enough, women have their own sets of issues. But then not a single thing was said for men's rights and men's issues. (which wasn't a surprise honestly) Not a word about workplaces deaths, or a quota being pushed for women-dominated workplaces like nurse, or help for men's health, or idk literally any of the issue we're trying to get the public aware of. They don't even throw us a bone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just rolled my eyes because I expected it. But then later on there was this dumb ad which had a woman giving a speech about parity in the workplace and who lets out a huge sigh, camera turns and we see that all the participants are all men, with a saying like \"this is gonna be a bad day so you deserve a good night\" blablabla. Like, oh no the *poor defenseless woman in the workplace in front of all the BIG BAD men.* (have the people from marketing even *heard* about how women behave in the work place when they're in large groups? shitty behavior doesn't have a gender)\n\nI'm really aware of the MRM and inequalities towards men since years, and I know how we're being treated, I'm used to it. But for some reason this stupid ad was the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak, and the reason I'm typing all this - after the news coverage of \"Génération Egalité\" and the forum being all about how women are oppressed and men privileged, *this* ad appears. Of course it's a coincidence but like wow they really take every occasion to take a jab at men uh ? You also had this old Axe ad about \"toxic masculinity\", all the ads where the man is sooo clueless about how household stuff works but *thanks god* his wife is there to show him (but you can't have an ad about a woman not knowing how to run a lawnmower for instance cuz that would be *sexist);* all the shows with the dad being irresponsible and/or an idiot, etc\\*.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrankly I'm just tired of men being either ignored, antagonized or laughed at by our society at large.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat would I have liked to hear when my president talked about gender issues ? Idk, *anything* remotely helping men would have do.\n\nI don't have any safe space for my gender only (besides the restroom, though I've been to places which had gender-neutral restrooms while still having a women-only space). I don't have a phone number I can call if I'm being abused by a woman. Laws are written such as I can't call it \"rape\" if a woman rapes me. Bad behaviors are being pointlessly gendered and put on us as a group but if a woman is being an asshole we just call her that, an asshole, instead of debating our opinion about a whole gender and calling it toxic feminity. There's no \"parity\" for men, and no action to get men in women-dominated fields, but there are plenty of \"affirmative action\" being pushed for women to get into programs. \"Parity\" can get women a reserved seat but only for high-power/high-paying jobs while dangerous, low paying jobs are mainly filled by men. Men are systematically fucked in the court. If my country goes to war, I'm expected to die for it as a man. If I go on [change.org](https://change.org) to make a petition, I can select \"women's issues\" but not \"men's issues\" - why not simply call it gender issue? We don't have any movement to represent us in positions of power. FGM is recognized as mutilation, and rightfully so, but as I'm writing this there are still baby boys being \"circumcized\". Etc etc, I could go on about the many many double standards and inequalities we all know about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not privileged, I'm a poor-ass dude trying to make his way out of poverty and just live a normal life. I never got any benefit or anything handed to me for having a penis (which, by the way, was mutilated at birth without my consent by health professionals). In fact, some people assume the worst about me simply because I'm a man. It's a dumb story now, but I still have a clear memory of when I was a kid in school and a girl I didn't even *know or talk to* went to a teacher to say I hit her; I had to publicly make an excuse despite bawling my eyes out that I didn't know her and didn't hit her - it was her word against mine and I was told to stop lying, and to stop crying. As I said it's been years and it's a dumb story now but I find it's a funny anecdote to point a behavior that is still present in our adult society.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like you can't even bring any of this up without *some form* of backlash. I'm a gay man, who leans **very** left on most issues - with some views I'm sure clashes with a lot of people's here (which doesn't matter, as we're not here to talk about which political party we like but what can be done for men in our societies). Some of my closest friends are women, and I was raised by a single mother who was victim of domestic violence when my father was alive - *of COURSE I'm sensible to and support women's issues*. Yet if I try to bring up men's rights in the most respectful way possible, I'm still called names, called \"far right\"/\"mysoginist\"/\"women hater\", etc... - why can't men's rights just be human's rights, why can't I support both women and men's rights ? Why am I being blamed for things a minority of men do ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople try to make fun of MRAs by saying \"wHaT aBoUt MeN?\" -- *yes,* WHAT ABOUT MEN ? I feel like society is failing us, that I'm being treated as a second-zone citizen and that my gender is being constantly antagonized without anyone batting an eye.",

    "text": "This is an anonymous letter from a circumcised man to his 18-year-old self, about the trauma and issues that circumcision has caused in his personal life. Placing the whole letter text in here but the link, if you want to read it on our website, is [https://15square.org.uk/letter-from-a-circumcised-man-to-his-18-year-old-self/](https://15square.org.uk/letter-from-a-circumcised-man-to-his-18-year-old-self/)\n\nIt was commissioned by 15 Square and written by the content creators at [**Best Fertility Now**](https://bestfertility-now.com/), to highlight the ongoing effect of medical circumcision on newborns.\n\n**The letter is based on the real-life experiences sent into 15 Square, and contains mature and triggering content, including medical trauma, depression and adult themes.**\n\n📷\n\nDear 18 year old me. Future you is wiser, but you have better hair. Older you is tougher and less angry, but underneath it all, I’m afraid we’re both still traumatised.\n\nWe’re still here though, so those times you felt suicidal about your circumcision and the problems it’s caused you – looks like you made it through after all. Not everyone does, unfortunately. Nobody deserves to feel like that though, whether they get over [**feeling suicidal**](https://www.jamesplace.org.uk/) or not.\n\nIf I could only step back in time to tell you one thing about the problems that our circumcision will cause us in the future, I would say this:\n\nYou have a lifetime of people pushing you away and telling you to get over yourself. Women will leave you because of the psychological and sexual issues it will cause you.  \nDoctors will sneer at you when you tell them that something’s not right.  \nLoved ones will tell you that it’s no big deal and it’s all in your head.  \nWhat’s really happening is that you need help and support, but for a while nobody will believe you. Try not to get too angry and upset about that, because it will eat you alive if you let it.\n\nI’d also say your pain is real and valid, but you will worry that you’re whining, making a fuss over nothing, and that you’re not man enough to deal with having a part of your manhood stolen from you with violence.  \nOur mam will say “You’re not angry that you’re circumcised are you?” as if someone put your newspaper in the bin or used the last of the milk.\n\nThat’s going to take you a good few years to get your head around. My advice to you is don’t even go down the road of self-doubt.\n\nThe short answer to your confusion is yes – your circumcision did take far more from you than [**square inches of skin**](https://15square.org.uk/circumcised-men/losses-from-circumcision/).  \n**No, you are not pathetic for reacting normally to that.**  \nAlso, I want you to know that [**other men feel exactly the same way you do**](https://15square.org.uk/real-people-real-stories/). You are not a freak.\n\nI would also say that it’s going to get worse. It’s not like this for every man who’s circumcised, but [**it is for us**](https://15square.org.uk/anonymous-archive-voices-against-circumcision/).\n\nBy “it” I mean the lack of sensitivity in your penis.  \nYou are starting to wonder if what you are feeling is normal for a lad your age.  \nNo, it is not. It’s just not going to feel as good for you, because the doctor did a bit of damage. By the time you are my age, you will feel even less. One girlfriend will say “It’s a good thing though because you can keep going for ages!” and you will laugh and say yes because you’re in love with her, but really you will be dying inside.  \nThe same girl will also leave you because she wants a boyfriend who’s not suffering from depression, which is likely caused by the issues stemming from your circumcision.\n\nFrom the perspective of Older You, she isn’t the real love of your life, but she definitely was that particular year. So it won’t stop you from being heartbroken and feeling even more down on yourself.\n\nI would then tell you that Old You is still, sadly, angry with our parents for letting the medical profession railroad them into having their [**baby circumcised**](https://15square.org.uk/will-a-circumcision-procedure-hurt-my-baby/).  \nOur parents have both passed on, but I can’t let the last specks of anger go. I want to remember them with love, as I did love them and I know they loved me – but this is such a barrier to my peace of mind.\n\nI’m confident that circumcision wouldn’t have crossed their minds without a doctor suggesting it, pushing for it and implying that it was a normal, healthy and sane thing to do. That helps a little bit with forgiveness, but at the same time, they could have just said no.\n\nMy rage at the doctors and nurses was indescribable, when I realised the clinical detachment it takes to mutilate a screaming baby for no reason, I promise that you will feel anger like never before.  \n**This is a normal and healthy reaction** I think while cutting the foreskin from a hysterical newborn, seems objectively less healthy and normal and human to me.  \nBut for a long time, society will tell you that you are the one that has things the wrong way around. It is maddening, but try not to let it get to you too much.\n\nWhen you get married and hold your son for the first time, vowing to protect him with your very last breath, that anger will bubble over and haunt you for months. Every time you look at your helpless newborn, **you will remember that your own parents allowed you to be taken to a room alone, where your arms and legs were strapped down, and you were butchered without anaesthetic.**  \nWe’re supposed to forget the pain you see, being so young. But I am certain that traces of that experience remain for me because although I don’t remember it happening, I was terrified of it happening to my son.\n\nMam’s dismissal of the whole issue has haunted me a lot. I used to put my head on her shoulder and tell her everything when I was little. But as I got older and this began to trouble me, she didn’t want to know. She’d say “That’s what everyone did. It was normal. It was hygienic. Your brother never had a problem with it.”\n\nAs much as I love and miss our mam, that put a distance between us.  \nThere were things I could have told her after that – stuff about girls, stress and other things in my life, but I stopped bothering. If she could have just once acknowledged how I felt, I might have trusted her again.  \nMy advice to you, my younger self, is not to expect the older generation to be sorry. It’s wonderful when they are, but don’t bother pushing for it. You’ll be disappointed.\n\nTalk to Mam about other stuff, she still loves you. She still wants to hear about your broken heart and your gig tickets, and you’ll miss her and regret that distance when she’s not here any more.\n\nI also want to tell you that circumcision has affected a whole generation of men, not just you. One day you will be able to talk openly with these men, but there are many more who struggle to say anything at all about it.  \nOne thing you can be proud of when you are older is that you did build up the courage to talk about it, you did finally [**seek help**](https://15square.org.uk/membership-account/membership-options/), and you have listened to other men and validated their experience.\n\nThis took a long time and a lot of anxiety to get around to, but it was well worth doing. I want to tell you that nobody wants to belong to the circumcised and traumatised club, but it’s full of good men.  \nMen who just want to be husbands, business owners, fathers, teachers, friends and colleagues, but are forever haunted by the violent violation that occurred before they could even speak. **These men are scarred and bruised, and that’s invisible to 99% of people.**\n\nFinally, I would tell you that older me is proud of you. For coping, even though you will feel like you weren’t doing so well sometimes.  \nProud of you for hanging on, even though you sometimes didn’t feel like being alive for much longer.  \nProud of you for finally finding people that understand, even though everyone in your life for many years told you that you were being pathetic and silly.  \nProud of you for listening to others about their problems, whether they were caused by circumcision or not, because you know exactly how it feels to be emotionally abandoned by those who claim to care for you.  \nJust because they don’t want to know. Because **“It’s just a bit of skin”** or “you were a baby and you don’t remember”.\n\nAnd finally, I’m proud of you for going on to have relationships, kids, sex and a life. What happened to you and to all of us is devastating, and it’s difficult at 18 and it’s difficult at 28, and at every age after that too, but we kept going.  \nFinally, I want you to know that all of that anger and despair has gone on to make a difference and that older you is campaigning and supporting changes that make people think twice about circumcising babies.  \nAlthough something was taken from us, we still have the strength to give back. In the end, we won. It’s been a rough battle though.\n\nTake care, my 18 year old circumcised self, and I’ll see you in a few years.",

    "text": "Question her story and she's mad at me Question her story she got mad at me\n\nThe story is a doozy me (34 m) was talking to my sister (24 f) she made a post on the internet about rapes victim since she work as a nurse I was asking her about her job but she said no she is a victim herself and she said I know her attacker. \n\nShe said it's our uncle that raise  her since she was 8 years old. With three other girls in the house of his daughters roughly the same age as her .\n\nI told her you can't drop something like that and this is a serious crime you're accusing him then I start asking question when it happened how it happened she got it mad at me for not believing her. And I asked for police report or something in that nature or anybody that can cooperate the story \n\nDescription of my uncle he's a no nonsense attitude person he will ground you in a heartbeat if you disrespect him he's old school the man supposed to take care of his family no matter and also believing gender role he is not perfect but he seemed like a pretty good guy\n\nThe reason why I would question my sister cuz she have a history of lie or been the truth once internet she told the whole family that I was abusing my brother ( I wasn't) because how I treated him I'm not going to the story but he's being lazy and it's not for me to work it while he stay in the house my uncle and my aunt they will marry for 23. years question me ask me is it true or not I have to explain why so the story and they let it go\n\nThe second time is when her and my uncle had a fight and she called me saying that he hit her for no reason my uncle live 3 hours away from where I live she gave me her side of the story but knowing that's always to side of every story and he gave me the benefit of doubt and my sister said I was abusive I I took the day off and went to talk to him he gave me his side of the story and I can go in the detail but she left a couple of stuff out.And for the record I questioned everybody in the house in the story match with my uncle said   to my aunt to my cousins.\n\nIt seem like I'm biased right now but like I said this is a serious allegation\n\nSo I said my cousin who is (30 f) my plan to drive up and ask my Uncle in my aunthis side of the story and my cousin told my sister but my plan and my sister went off on me cursing me out for a good 30 second telling me that I am dead to her eyes you should always believe victim and she doesn't need a police report and she disowned me me being a smart-ass respond half sibling so the work is halfway done.\n\nSo I blocked her since I'm dead to her then I called my cousin cuz she's only one that new my plan and she did not answer and she gave me the runaround so I blocked her to \n\nMy plan didn't change I was going to drive the 3 hours to ask my uncle his side of the story and my uncle second child (25f)called me telling me that do not do this it's going to destroy the family and think of your aunt who have a high blood pressure and it could get worse\nSo I called her tell her that why are you guys stopping from asking question she gave me the runaround telling me think about the family think of your aunt who have a high blood pressure when that didn't work she called me selfish and call me that I should believe her cuz she's my sister for 30 minutes and I didn't budge and she got mad and hung up on me\nSo guys you guys are all caught up now the question is am I the asshole or should I just let it goTime for update\n\nSo you guys know the story so I don't need to go in the detail I went there to talk to my aunt and my uncle that'd be the best time to talk to them since all the girls going to have a hot girl summer and another country under the uncle dime the only person was there was the eldest cousin (30f) in the younger cousin(20m)\n\n when I went there my sister and  cousin miss her flight so my uncle is trying really hard to make a accommodation for her because she didn't have the right paperwork to fly due to \nCoronavirus\n\nI left the house at 3:00 in the morning I got there at 6:00 in the morning I got there they were up getting accommodation done for my sister and cousin since I had a pretty long drive I did not bring up the conversation and went straight to the spare room they had for me\n\nI woke up around 1:00 in the afternoon my uncle is at work already so it's just me and my aunt talking while she was making me lunch she told me I know the reason why you came here she said I am shocked at my sister will say something like that to the uncle my reply was who tells you and how long you knew\n\nShe told me that the older cousin told her both of them and she knew 3 weeks they told her that I was coming to ask question so they gave her a heads up remind you do the same people that said let it go don't bring up to the parent I don't even think my sister knows they told her\n\nMy aunt told me that you know your sister she had mental issue and I told my aunt that I still got look into it as the big brother so ask a couple of questions the question was breaking my aunt heart I felt like a terrogator\n\nAfter she answer all my question I told her that I have to ask the husband too now she said I know and she told me that you need to forgive your sister and I said no that you really have to forgive her this is what Christian people should do I remind her I said I'm not Christian I don't even forgive I had to remind my aunt if I was another person if I didn't take the chance to ask question I would have shot him and called it a day \n\nMy aunt replied by saying I'm happy that you have enough sense not to do that at least ask question I just said just look in your heart to forgive her in your cousin did me as a joke said sure give me 10 years to forget the problem\n\nSo that conversation was done with my aunt I unblocked my (30f)cousin who told my sister my plan my cousin gave me some BS excuse about I did not give her enough time to explain herself she would tell me her job was stressful and took no accountability she worked for a school district and I put it out that if a kid say something like this you look into it you don't look away from it you ask question cuz I used to be a manager that what we do\n\nI was disappointed the answer my  older cousins made me feel like I'm the bad guy for even asking questions so I blocked my cousin what a four-page essay saying she a shit person I can't trust you anymore you were the oldest in this house we could have worked together to figure this out instead you stabbed me in the back from my sister  have a history of  lying\nAnd I still gave her the benefit of doubt \n\nThe younger cousin (m20) saw me talking to my aunt and ask questions what was I talking about I gave him a rundown what my sister said about his dad and he was in this for belief saying that he would never do something like that and I told him I still have to look into it\n\nI told him why I blocked his older sister and why I stopped talking to my sister he replied that he should never had tell the older sister of your plan\nHe told me that you should have told me about it and I probably would have helped you look into it I replied hindsight is 20/20 now\n\nSo later that day I waited for my uncle to come back from work so we can get to talking he knew the reason why I came over there his wife told him told him that morning when I came in the house he was telling me that what the wife said bother him for the work day and I told him that I still got to ask question it doesn't matter how you feel\n\nI started asking questions I said let me see your phone I want to see the text message between you and my sister he showed me his phone with no problem\n I will interrogated him my sister called his cell phone on FaceTime I told him that I don't want her to know I'm here\nSo he declined the FaceTime from her and pick ed up on  speaker only and my sister was saying that I appreciate you helping me thank you for looking out for me and stuff like that in the back of my head like this is not how a victim supposed to act I start asking question at 9:00 at night to 12:00 a.m. he was really heartbroken that she would say something like that he raised her as daughter since she was eight treat her like his own daughter even all the allegations he still want to help her \n\nI reply you're crazy and stupid you need to cut people out your life this was a serious charge\nSince he told me since he's a Christian man I must forgive her you know your sister have problems and you have to look into your heart forgiveness I said not this again then \n\nI asked a question why would my sister say something like that to you he told me that he cut her off during college he was giving her $800 a month he said she got the money and spent it within the week so she asked for more money he replies and I gave you money and she caught an attitude with him I remember the situation because my aunt called me to tell me to talk to her about her spending habit and my sister told me who told you about my spending habit and I replied it doesn't matter I told her I don't care if you go broke but leave my aunt and uncle out of it and that's the last time I heard from it \nMy uncle is not hurting for money he will spoil his kids on the vacation trip he gave his two daughter $500 plus my sister $300 I spending money plus pay for the trip plane ticket for $1,500 he said that since the girls graduate college and got a master he was obligated to take care of them he asked me what I've done the same I said no I'm a cheap bastard he probably get a $50 gift card me making a joke to lighten the tension\n\nI told him what you going to do with my sister now I do not want to come back again to hear something else he told me that she still my daughter I raise her I said she's 24 years old and she's saying crazy thing about you I said you need to cut ties with her and stop giving her money. And block her he told me that he would like his wife make the decision for him but he did tell me in his heart he forgive her I said that's great till the wrong person here what she's saying or the police look into it and you're up a lawyer fee but you got the money though\n\nFor his credit he understand where I'm coming from my sister live a hour and 30 minutes away from him and my sister moved in with her boyfriend I really feel bad for this guy my sister boyfriend I do not think you know how crazy my sister is that is his problem now\n\nI was there for a couple more days my aunt and uncle telling me that they have trouble sleeping because what my sister said about him they are blaming they self they did everything right to raise that girl and she said something like that they are really hurt I made a joke if you want to get over it they're the liquor store around the corner it cracked attention\nBut they have to work through it they self that I can't help them with that the day I was going to leave my uncle and Aunt corner me and my cousin cuz we haven't said a word since\n I was there and we both are giving each other silent treatment my cousin screamed out I blocked her is nothing to talk about that's the only thing she said to me since I was there I replied that you stabbed me in the back she went off to work I went off to my the car to drive back home my uncle and Aunt are pretty sad between us we were pretty close but I replied saying we made our choice we got to live with it\n\nAs the older brother I did not like asking these uncomfortable question I knew it needed to be done my sister and my cousin got in my way to find out the truth the truth is there was nothing there and they knew that that's what they try to stop me did I do the right thing how I handle it",

    "text": "Article encouraging people to randomly approach strangers is tone deaf. I get approached a lot in public by men who often behave in threatening ways.  Sometimes they want money, sometimes it's just attention, but it is always a burden.  I'm also a rape survivor and the inevitability of these unwanted interactions always weighs heavily on me afterwards.\n\nI want to talk about this article (linked below) that encourages people to approach and talk to strangers more.  As soon as I read the article heading I knew it had to be written by a man.  Then, reading further along, it became clear that it wasn't purely an opinion piece - much of the article was focused on an interview with a nurse and a university study of people who volunteered to interact with strangers and then report back with their own opinions of the experience.\n\nI found it interesting that while two separate studies were mentioned, both hinged their findings on the assessments of those who initiated the exchanges.  And even encouraged readers to initiate these exchanges with people who are at work.  Though there were claims that these exchanges were all positive for both parties, in no case were the people who were approached at random interviewed for their actual thoughts on the matter.\n\nAt best, this article seems like it should have been titled \"Extroverted people enjoy their interactions with random strangers\" but for anyone who is already struggling with random strangers approaching them in threatening ways, it just seems like it's grossly reckless in normalizing adjacent behavior and encourages an entitlement to the time, attention, and space of others.  Not something we need more of.\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/08/why-we-should-talk-strangers-more/619642/?utm_source=pocket-newtab",
