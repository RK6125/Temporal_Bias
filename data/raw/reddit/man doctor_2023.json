    "text": "Need Advice About Moody Boss I work for one of the biggest cargo/transportation companies in the country and travel quite a bit within North America. I am only an analyst (F) and my boss is my manager (M). We’ve done a few trips together and I’ve noticed a few strange things that I was hoping to get advice on. \n\nSome background:\n\nTrips that we could fly for, he chooses to rent a car and makes me go with him alone. He always wants to leave extremely early the day before and stay a day later even though our engagement with the client takes 4 hours maximum. I have to eat all my meals with him and he spends lots of time complaining about his wife and home life and wishing he married someone like me that takes care of their man at home. He knows this because I’ve told him that I like to cook and clean when I’m at home because my husband works even more than I do. I also catch him starting at me and my body alot. It makes me very uncomfortable.\n\nWhen we are at the office he stares at my body while talking to me instead of my face. He also doesn’t let me speak up during meetings even though I do 90% of all the analysis and work for our department. \n\nI recently found out that my husband and I are pregnant. I’ve been battling terrible morning sickness and hyperemesis gravidarum that makes me unable to be in a car, keep down food, water, talk or sometimes even walk. I’ve been getting medical care as well as medication that has not helped much. \n\nI had to cancel our latest trip that included 3 different 5-hour flights. Multiple drives and lunches and lots of walking around maintenance facilities. I waited until a few days before the trip to see if my condition would improve and it didn’t. I told him I had to cancel the trip on my side and stay home due to the HG and doctors orders. Mind you he scheduled this trip to arrive 30 hours before our meeting for some strange reason and to stay almost 24 hours past our last meeting. A Sunday morning to Friday night trip for two meetings that last 4 hours each. Just to spend more time away from home. It really bothers me because I hate being away from home but will travel when necessary. My husband is overseas a lot every month so every moment at home is precious for us. My boss  sent me a thumbs up via text when I told him I couldn’t go and didn’t speak to me again. \n\nHe hasn’t spoken to me professionally in over a week. \nHasn’t included me in some important meetings and doesn’t collaborate on work properly since last week. I don’t understand this non-professional behavior. It’s almost like some sort of tantrum? He’s almost 40. I just truly don’t get it or if I should just go about my job and ignore him? I really need advice. He’s making me feel like I’ve done something wrong. Thank you for reading.",

    "text": "Need help deciding between jobs I was offered a job today and I am conflicted about accepting. First, it pays the exact same as my current job but does offer benefits so that is not a concern.\n\nMy current job is 4 days a week, 7-4:30 in a medical setting. I have worked at this particular office 3 months but I have 5 years experience in the industry. I am good at the job and did not need much training because I was already familiar with the position. I have had problems with one coworker from day one. Attempts to discuss with the doctor (owner) and the office manager are met with \"oh Karen is just Karen.\" I have recently caught her gossiping about me to other coworkers. I brought this up as well and was told she is just jealous because I am more knowledgeable. I have noticed that other coworkers are now avoiding asking me for things and will instead wait for Karen to be finished. That being said, I don't want to leave this job because I get 3 weeks paid vacation when the office is closed, a week personal days, and every bank holiday off. I also only work Monday through Thursday and am off at 4.\n\nThe job offer is for an airport adjacent company owned by a man who also owns the company my husband works for, though they are two distinct companies. Hours are Monday through Friday, 7-3:30. It's an industry I've never worked in, though it is general administration work so I'm not concerned about learning it, and it is in a loud warehouse. Honestly I only applied because the listing made it seem like my husband and I could carpool but that is not the case because our schedules would be too different. \n\nI'm leaning towards keeping my current job but I want an outside perspective because I can get stuck in what's \"comfortable\" rather than what's good for me. Thoughts?",

    "text": "I feel guilty about potentially leaving my job and I don’t know what to do Background: I started my current about 15 months ago, after I struggled to find a job once I finished my classes for my Psych Masters degree- but was still working on ny thesis. The job offers no benefits, pay isn’t great, hours are weird, and I really only ended up there because of familial association. It was also known that I would unlikely work there longterm, all I was asked was to give my boss as much advanced notice as possible.\n\nDespite all of this, I do find that my boss genuinely cares about me as a person, and I have grown quite close to another staff member here. For example, I wasn’t feeling well today and my boss went out and bought me a few beverages so I would stay hydrated, and for my birthday recently the other staff member made me a cake. I’ve also been able to learn some skills I didn’t have before, and I’m basically my boss’s right hand man.\n\nNow, I feel like I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. I didn’t realize it, but my LinkedIn, which I seldom use, had my resume visible to recruiters. I end up getting a message from a head hunting agency in the area, and low and behold it sounds like I’m going to have a job offer soon- a job offer that would at least be double, if not closer to triple my current pay, have benefits, AND they would be willing to pay for whatever schooling I may need.\n\nI know should this job offer come through (and I’m inclined to believe it’s happening), I would end up leaving right in the middle of the most hectic time of year. Additionally, when I thought about mentioning that someone was trying to recruit me- someone quit! On top of it all- she’s been going out of her way lately to give me food, little gifts, helping with sharing my survey for my thesis, etc. I’m starting to feel sick with guilt now.\n\nOn top of it all, I have some health issues I’m trying to deal with right now. I’m not dying, but I do have two appointments with doctors in what I would assume will be the first month I would work at the new job and I can’t change the time/date.\n\nI don’t know what to do, and would love some advice.",

    "text": "Passed over for promotion from part-time to full-time (higher education) Just like the title says. I have worked full-time as an adjunct (all the work with none of the pay!) at a local community college for the last almost four years. I have said yes to everything—I’ve taught dual credit classes, prison courses, countless hybrid and online courses. It has been rewarding and I’ve gained valuable skills…but it very quickly became a very monotonous, tedious gig. But I kept telling myself that it will lead to something, that I’m early career (graduated with doctorate in 2020), that I’m putting in my dues. I’ve done my own research—unsupported—on the side and have managed to publish four papers on my own (history and architectural history). I’ve redesigned the main course I’ve been assigned to teach, granting other instructors access to my materials. I’ve put my head down and worked to build up my resume. In the meantime, I have applied to other places through the years. I’ve always gotten rejected (not even an interview) but, still, I would just tell myself I need more experience and take on more. I taught five classes this fall, for example (and I don’t get T.A.s so I had to grade all assignments for 100+ students myself). \n\nSeptember 2023, I got a call from my head of department saying an opening for a full-time instructor in my field has been made available and he encouraged me to apply. He reminds me that it will be an open internal hire but that I’m still his favorite candidate for 👆🏼reasons. I apply the day the job ad goes up. I have my first interview a few weeks later and the follow up the following week. I then wait for a month. In the meantime, boss-man routinely emails me with updates implying there’s a positive outcome once he hears from HR. Quite recently, I get the call: he asks if I’m available to talk; says he finally got the “green light” from HR then follows up saying “I’m sorry to have to give you bad news”; and then spends 10-20 minutes trying to brainstorm with me about how he can keep me around and happy despite this (meanwhile, I’m just trying to restrain my emotions and keep everything professional). He also speculated that HR didn’t want to give bad news mid semester. meanwhile, he dropped this turd on me when I still had to finish grading the five classes I was assigned and submit final grades for the semester after we hung up. Just the cherry on top of the shit sundae. \n\nNeedless to say, I’m gutted. What a slap in the face. I feel used and betrayed. And I don’t know what to do. What do I have to do to get my foot in the door? What do I have to do to prove I’m a capable historian, teacher, administrator (this college splits semesters in half…so I get a new schedule every 6-7 weeks—sometimes even teaching 3 week courses—and I’ve mixed things up twice in four years of this bullshit system. Given that I also routinely manage 80-150 students all by myself, I’d say I’m a good administrator)? I haven’t been to a conference in years but a) I am always so busy teaching and b) I don’t get paid enough to be able to afford going to these destination networking events. \n\nIn short, does anyone have any advice? Words of encouragement? Right now the only thing that cuts through the numbness is consuming iterations of melted cheese and I can’t keep doing that.",

    "text": "Help me consider careers that match my skills and interests that do not require further education \n43F who is autistic with ADHD, Alberta Canada. I tried to give comprehensive background but summarized most info in category TLDRs.\n\nIntro: \nI aced University but I generally suck at real life. I am lost trying to think of a job that will allow me to live without eventual burnout from masking as an autistic.  I need something that gives me flexibility for my waxing and waning energy and requires very little hustling in person or on the phone. Email is fine because communicate much more effectively in writing than verbally. I would consider related self employment ideas too.\n\nIdeal job characteristics: \nFocus on creativity,  problem solving in Science & Arts. Importance placed on ideation and planning for implementation, and then delegate to others to actually finish. Maybe project based? No cold calling or selling and prefer remote or hybrid work. Ideas which help others is very appealing.  \n\nStruggles with typical employment: TLDR: mostly Communication / Sensory\n\n- Just getting employment. I am terrible at interviews. \n- work at 200% 3 days a week and 10% the last 2 days when I am recovering. \n- Asking too many questions and wanting to know more about stuff outside of my job description. \n- Meetings leave me confused and unclear about priorities and what was brainstorming vs actionable ideas.\n- Treating everyone as my peer to have intelligent conversations and brainstorming with regardless if speaking with a 7 year old or my CEO. \n- Subjective language and unclear expectations/ directions\n- Feeling like an outsider- the loneliness of not really wanting to do outside of work social activities but also feeling hurt when everyone is closer or they stop bothering to invite you. \n- Oversharing\n- Environment: I need a quiet minimally stimulating area with few human interactions. \n- I tend to have SO MUCH STUFF because I hate not having what I need in the moment. This means I am messy in the wrong environment. \n\nWhat I enjoy: TLDR: mostly creating and finding solutions. \n\n- Thinking about the “big ideas and issues” such as  climate crisis, consciousness, cognitive development, sources and solutions for inequality, longtermism, ethics, modelling human development of cognition to facilitate research. \n- Learning!!!! I am a slow processor at times especially if requires visualization to understand the lecture but once it clicks I am on my way. \n- Visually designing something\n- Creating systems/ organizing ideas for others \n- Editing photos (but just the editing part- I know little about the actual in-person taking photos) \n- Communicating about science \n- Graphic Design in Canva / Easy (little coding) web design in drag/drop programs like wix\n- Writing\n- designing and building things BUT I never like building or creating the same major idea twice. \n- Hobbies : Video Microscopy, drawing, water colour portraits,\n- \nWhat I am good at: \nTLDR: skills: Researching, Ideation, problem-solving, areas: Psychology, Cognitive Science, Medicine , Education, visual Arts. \n\n- Researching, tracking down info- I swear my persistence means I can find anything. I am so happy and hyperfocused when working on a problem/ question. \n- Learning new skills \n- Prompt generation, I just seem to be able to keep shaping a prompt until I get what I need. I do think that Prompt engineering as a career will soon be obsolete as technology makes the middle man no longer needed.  \n- Mentoring, I am very good at researching and offering resources and solutions. As an older student (43) I had many younger classmates come for advice which always surprises me. \n- Finding the best deals on things (I guess this fits into researching) \n- Aesthetics and styling. I have always had a good sense of what is visually pleasing. \n- Finding creative ways to educate that uses project and experiential learning to help people remember and apply their knowledge\n- Writing: I love to write both academically and to write personal but informative papers to help break down the gate keeping of knowledge. We all deserve the opportunity to have complex ideas broken down into meaningful communication. \n- Providing strategies for interacting with ND kiddos\n- Weird and  not a job possibility but medical/ psych diagnosing. Don’t worry I do not go around giving people diagnoses I just have the background and I see patterns in symptoms . I don’t always have the greatest memory but I remember everything medical. 🤷‍♀️\n- Developing Teaching materials and lessons. (I wish I could just do this and not do the teaching 😉) \n\n\nEducation:\nTLDR: certificate: family engagement in medical research diplomas: Nursing, audio engineering Degrees: BSc, BEd\n\n\n-Audio Engineering post-production diploma (obsolete now, but the foundations like layering and signal flow  have helped me a lot with editing music, video, photos, and graphic design) \n\n-Practical Nursing Diploma (license now lapsed) taught me how much I love science and medicine. Worked as a pediatric nurse but hated that curiosity and thirst for knowledge  was frowned upon (aka: “why does the rationale for the order matter? Just do it.”)\n\n- BSc Life Science with a focus on Physiology, Pharmacology, Biology, Neuroscience. This was supposed to be my pre-med once I realized I wanted to be a pathologist not nurse but my family responsibilities made it obvious towards the end that med school + residency was not a possibility \n\nBEd focus Science. My BSc was useless as I had planned it as a stepping stone to med school. My Uni offered a 2 year after degree bachelor of Education program. I thought I could work as a science teacher but despite graduating with a 4.0 I realized the level of masking required to teach K-12 would break me down in less than a year. Love teaching small groups and adults. Also was hired as a research assistant and received funding to do my own educational research which I LOVE. \n\nIf I could I would love to be in grad school doing research into developing a methodology to analyze and model curriculum to develop longtermism thinking in k-12 school but that is not a possibility because my husband isn’t keen after 6 years studying to have 5+ more for my doctorate and I need to make some kind of financial contribution to our family.",

I've been using Revit and CAD since high school, being trained by my high school teacher who is also an architect. I've had multiple internships with college that were always short term because they were contractural or school conflict. \n\nAfter I graduated, I struggled to find a job for a year and a half. Then I worked with an engineering firm where the employer was alway stresses out for 8 months. Was recruited into a fire alarm company, but was released in a month because I had surgery. Found an architecture firm, but it was basically a mill and I was removed because I went to a doctor's appointment on my first month. Then found a one-man contracting firm where I and another person was basically doing my architect's homework while he was busy off doing meetings. \n\nThen I found my current job because I thought I was going to significantly earn more.\n\nIn the past six months I learned that besides the long drive and taxed out paychecks, my managers do not always charge for their times, because they don't to go over the budgets on projects, even though the clients are being cheap and asking for too many revisions.  \n\nThis isn't some tiny firm, it's supposedly an award winning firm with 5 locations across the US. So I'm really shocked by this. \n\nThe problem I have with this is that it also affects me, because it might force me to do overtime on a project but I won't have permission to charge for it. \n\nI asked my managers, since I'm fast and efficient on other projects, if I can help them take off the workload on these projects since they're almost always doing overtime. But they cannot because they don't have enough time to explain the context or tasks or scope of work, and I don't know how to get this information any other way. \n\nI feel bad about my managers' situations, but it also makes me feel bad about my profession as a whole. I feel like they're undervaluing themselves to keep cheap clients, and that I might have to follow in their footsteps. I had a talk to my manager about it and they told me they feel like this is just the way the profession is, with any other firm. And while I don't completely believe them, I think the idea that this is a common problem, makes me want to quit pursuing the profession, since I'm struggling to support myself financially on this job alone and need so many side gigs. \n\nI want to job hop, but I don't want to burn bridges or yet again add another red flag on my resume. But I think this is a problem that's bigger than me to solve on my own. I just value work-life balance, my health and self-love.",

    "text": "Just a Reminder to Be Careful Around Military Men....Abuse, violence, & disregard for other's lives are celebrated not discouraged. You will not be the exception. Just took a peek at the USMC sub (yes I know...won't do that again. JFC) to see the responses about the [Marine veteran who murdered a homeless passenger](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/nyc-subway-rider-accused-jordan-neelys-chokehold-death-marine-veteran-rcna83068).  Mind you the homeless man wasn't threatening anyone, just yelling at  himself about being tired of being hungry and poor. That's not a crime.  The vet put this man in a choke hold for over 15 minutes. He died. And  most of the comments are cheering this on and celebrating. I just called  one of them out and here's the reply I got:\n\n**Get the fuck out of here. You’re not in the military, and you wouldn’t even last a second, despite the supposedly low standards.**\n\n**You  are utterly unremarkable. You are below average in looks, height,  strength, and you are a overwhelmingly boring person. When you die, no  one will remember who you are or care. Cheers**\n\nBe  careful out there...men who serve the country aren't entitled to  threaten, intimidate, or abuse you. Ever. I dated a Navy vet for a period of time...alcoholism, verbal abuse, and cheating were the \"reward\" I got for trying to stay for support and encourage him to get help.  If they can't separate what  they were doing while serving from how they treat women in everyday life  then you deserve to find a safe and stable relationship elsewhere. As  you damn well won't be getting it from one of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdated to give recent news links.\n\nEDIT: If you're a Stephen Crowder fan/military vet who's triggered by this post. Get help. Women aren't your little punching bags to take out your anger on. Go on and downvote me. I said what I said. Most women agree with me whether you like that or not. It says a lot about you that you lash out at us instead of working to be a better human being.\n\n**EDIT 2:** To all of the people who refused to actually read what I wrote: I'm not saying it's 100% of the military. But, there IS a problem with military culture and DV, substance abuse, and SA. Congress literally had to create [a bill to address this because it's so bad](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1495). I won't be replying to anymore defenders of that who are actively minimizing how widespread this issue is.\n\n**EDIT 3:** [The Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12051387/Marine-vet-Jordan-Neely-chokehold-named-Daniel-Penny.html) (yes I know....) just released another article. THREE MEN WERE RESTRAINING HIM! There was no need to put him in a choke hold. For 15 minutes (per the article). I understand restraining him. But choking him for 15 minutes when there's two other adult men helping to pin him down is murder. I posted this not even to spotlight mental health issues with homeless people in America, I posted this because so many people overlooked disturbing details of what the Marine did simply because he served. So many women are abused and suffer in silence because of this hero worship and too many people overlook what active duty and veterans do simply because they served. YOU DO NOT GET A FREE PASS TO ABUSE OTHERS (ESPECIALLY YOUR SPOUSE & KIDS) BECAUSE YOU SERVED! Some people were shocked to hear my ex was a mean alcoholic. This post was only made to warn women NOT to hero worship and to be careful if they date a vet or active duty member. Not to debate whether there's an issue with mental health among the homeless (*some of you want to deflect and distract from DV an SA problems in the military using this tactic. Shame on all of you*).\n\n**EDIT 4**: SUPPORT SERVICES THAT WILL HELP IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES!!! u/BrainsPainsStrains mentioned [this](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/9164) new bill the \" Veterans Restitution and Justice Act\" will provide back pay for vets with PTSD from sexual assault trauma during service.\n\nSUPPORT ([call/email your representatives](https://www.commoncause.org/find-your-representative/)) UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SO YOU CAN GET THERAPY AND SEE A DOCTOR REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU WORK OR IF YOU LOST YOUR JOB!

Since then I’ve been having disconcerting health issues that my doctor is trying to get to the bottom of. I’m scheduled for testing with the best autonomic disorders team in the country next month after what will be 7 months of waiting. I’ve got an appointment with a rheumatologist to see why I’ve suddenly developed what seems to be Reynaud’s, and I was referred to a cardiologist for chest pain and exercise intolerance. \n\nNow the cardiologist had the shortest wait times for appointments and when I saw him in February, he told me I was too young (36) for heart problems and  it was probably GERD. So he gave me some proton pump inhibitors then told me to come back in three months. Obviously they didn’t help. \n\nToday when I went and saw my primary care doctor for my annual physical, she was looking over my cardiologist’s notes and got so upset. She gave me a list of demands for when I follow up with them and told me that if I were a man of my age with these symptoms and family history, they would have done serious testing as soon as they saw me, but since I’m a woman, they’re brushing it off. \n\nI’m so relieved to finally have someone who is taking my concerns seriously after having to switch providers because they kept telling me that I just have anxiety. Since you know, anxiety frequently causes you to turn blue and almost pass out in hot showers.",

I'm not body shaming but it comes up later with the topic of \"personal preferences\"\n\nWe've been easing our way into a relationship and have been intimate a few times. We've always been intimate in the dark. We both have insecurities so that's fine. \n\nBut... today we were having a conversation about surgeries and he's showing me the two scars on his knee where the doctors inserted.. like.. medical tools to work on his knee. I stood up and showed him my simular experience scars. My tubal ligation scars. One in my belly botton...  and I pulled my pants down an inch and showed him the other scar. \n\nI also showed him pubic hair.\n\nNot a lot. Im groomed well but.. not shaved to the skin..\n\nThis mans face turned to pure disgust. Pure. Disgust. And not just a twitch and correct... a full on stare through the few sentences I said, held with such a visceral reaction his lip twist upwards and his body pushed back.. \n\nI covered the inch of my pelvic area and, while feeling horrible about myself, left his house right then and there while he asked to talk about it... \n\nI'm sorry. More like.. how he wanted me to listen to him justify himself.\n\nHe said \"I don't know why you're so upset over me having a no hair preference.

What he did is literally like if he stood infront of me and took off his shirt and I stared at his chest fat or love handles or whatever else... and tell him without a single word I was disgusted by his body as it stood before me.\n\nWe can have preferences.. but to have such a visceral reaction infront of the person was disgusting of him. \n\nI told him I never did that to him.. never made him feel like his biggest insecurity (his body) had a single fault I found disgusting. \n\nAs i sit here now I never pointed out that its a huge turn off we almost have the same chest size... or that when he eats, he... EATS and a lot of what he eats is utter junk food and soda while he bitches about wanting to loose weight.  I know that i accepted his body and touched his sides and smacked his ass and rubbed his clavical area... but knowing getting onto of him meant like.. closing in on a split... Even just straddling his lap... it was something I ignored because i liked who he was and he was starting to go to the gym so i fell off it and moved on... but... he was so disgusted by an inch of natural.. groomed pubic hair... it just pisses me off so bad when he has an entire body he wants accepted. \n\nMaybe I'm over reacting.

    "text": "I am tired of being treated less than a woman just because of the way I was born So, I’m a woman who was born with a medical condition called CAIS. What this basically means is that although I was born looking like a baby girl and was also AFAB, I have XY chromosomes, and also had undescended testes which are commonly not even discovered until one has an ultrasound.\n\nMost patients with CAIS are raised female and end up identifying as girls as well, and individuals with this condition are also completely resistant to testosterone, which means that even the testosterone produced by our internal testes are aromatised to estrogen, so women also end up developing breasts and all the other secondary female sexual characteristics. I do not have any internal female reproductive organs, so I will not be able to get pregnant and I’ve not had a period.\n\nDoctors are mostly ignorant or mystified by my condition. It usually doesn’t come up until I reveal it, since from the outside I present completely as a woman. Well, I was at a new doctor yesterday, to perform a medical panel for a visa approval. Note that I am completely presenting as a woman, with a typically female name, wearing a headscarf and also have my passport stating my gender.\n\nI disclose the fact that I have CAIS to her, and she nods and acts as if she knows what that is. Next, she asks me if I’ve had any surgeries, so I mention that when I was a baby, I had surgery to remove my undescended testes, since by now I assumed she was aware about the condition. It just took the word testes, and her whole demeanour just changed. She first asks me if I am a man, and if I was born male. I mention that I am not, and I was AFAB, however genetically (chromosomally) I would be considered male due to my XY chromosomes. I try to explain more about the condition to her, since she was clearly ignorant, and in an extremely condescending way, she goes “I don’t need you to teach me medical information”\n\n\nShe then asks me if I’ve SRS surgery to present female, which CAIS women would not need since we are born with vaginas and develop breasts later, which she would have known if she was aware of the condition. I mention again that I was AFAB, and did not need any SRS. The rest of the conversation goes on like this, and by the end I am shaking and not even able to speak coherently. \n\nI am planning to report her to the board of medical doctors for making me feel uncomfortable. It just saddens me how little is known about the condition and how people choose to be wilfully ignorant. Sometimes this subReddit’s name also makes me feel dysphoric, and reminds me that I have a Y chromosome even though I am a woman. I’ve had to deal with blatant discrimination like this my whole life when people find out about my condition. People constantly even ask me what genitals I have. Just hoping people can become accepting and tolerant of what they do not understand, and I don’t even think it’s a very big ask.",

    "text": "A man with a barely-diagnosable case of my disorder says he’s getting surgery when I was told my moderate-to-severe case was too mild I’m 24 and a nonbinary afab. I have had a scoliosis diagnosis since middle school. I’ve tried bracing and multiple rounds of PT. Hell, my parents were even desperate enough to take me to a chiropractor. Nothing worked but the brace, which just slows progression but doesn’t reverse anything. Last year I had a 5 year follow up X-ray and I was told I had 2 32° curves. The orthopedist literally said he could do nothing and that I will just become disabled when I’m older. This year I saw a rheumatologist for widespread joint pain/hypermobility and he did a spine X-ray to see if my scoliosis was causing at least the hip pain. He put my scoliosis at moderate-to-severe. He ordered a lumbar MRI, which revealed I had herniated discs, bulging discs, and osteoarthritis. And that’s just my lumbar. Who knows what I’ve got going on in the other parts of my spine where i have equally terrible pain. And because I have curves under 45° i can’t get surgery due to “liability concerns”. Doesn’t matter how horribly I’m suffering or how poorly the conservative treatments work.\n\n\nThe pain is so bad that I get stomachaches from the amount of ibuprofen i take. And I combine the ibuprofen with Tylenol Arthritis (max otc strength) and lidocaine patches, but nothing changes. Some days I stay in bed. I also have chronic leg pain that occurs with the back pain that feels like my legs are being crushed. Leg pain that’s so mind numbingly severe that sometimes I need someone to stay with me so I don’t do anything insane to escape the pain. Like I literally lose my mind from experiencing pure agony beyond my comprehension.\n\n\nToday i saw a man with a VERY mild case of scoliosis say he was “finally” offered surgery after being diagnosed for TWO YEARS. He posted his xray and it was so mild that at first glance it looks normal. He said that because he was having nerve pain his doctors offered spinal fusion. When people asked if the surgery was really for his scoliosis since it was almost too mild for a scoliosis diagnosis, he said “yes that’s what they told me”. He’s getting several vertebrae fused to straighten out his slightly imperfect spine. ITS NOT FUCKING FAIR. WHY DO I HAVE TO SUFFER FOR YEARS AND WATCH MY SPINE FALL APART WHILE MEN GET CURED WHEN THEY START HAVING TOO MUCH PAIN? I have never felt so enraged. Men can literally just waltz into a doctors office and ask for major spinal surgery with several potential complications and get told yes because it’s their body their choice, but I could kick and scream for even something as small as a lidocaine 5% prescription and they would probably call me dramatic and tell me to try a 5th round of PT. I don’t know why suffering is expected for us. Good for him for getting relief, but why can’t I have that kind of relief too when I have it so much worse and for so much longer?\n\n\n\nEdit: just clearing up some FAQs. I am going to see a spine specialist next month, I’m just not optimistic. Though my lack of optimism is most likely irrational just because I have medical trauma and I’m used to *most* doctors I see not taking me seriously. I also cannot go to his specialist because they are out of state and I, like most people my age in the US, am struggling to get by. My insurance doesn’t cover out of state visits so I would be ensuring that I am in a financial hell hole for many years if I did that. One more financial mishap and I will be back with my abusive parents, or homeless. It’s not worth the sacrifice.",

    "text": "Haven't had sex in nearly 16 months and don't even want to date my husband anymore I'm in a down mood tonight and just want to get something off my chest.\n\n\nMy DH and I have had issues with a dead bedroom for years. It started a few months before I gave birth to our firstborn, who's now 5. His libido went to zero and stayed there. I felt neglected and unhappy, so I tried to solve the problem. I tied myself in knots trying to turn him on, only to find myself rejected the vast, vast majority of the time. I tried backing off and letting him be the initiator, only to find that his libido is active only approximately twice a year. I communicated until I was blue in the face about how I was feeling, how he was feeling, how we were a team, how we could solve this, etc. Got empty rhetoric of \"I'll do better\" in return.\n\n\nI want to note at this point that our sex life has never actually been \"good.\" I have never orgasmed from a man, DH included. He's never really tried. I've never really minded, because (a) I was young and stupid when we got together, and (b) I find sex to be primarily for bonding. I can have an orgasm by myself anytime; I can't achieve that special closeness to another person all by myself. Quantity over quality is genuinely okay by me.\n\n\nWhich of course means that having no quantity OR quality was/is a terrible combination. After about 1.5 years of effort -- and it WAS a huge effort -- we finally reached a better place, courtesy mainly of scheduling sex. We decided to go for a second kid. That took a while, and honestly I blame the lengthy conception process for a large part of what's happening now. He started rejecting any attempts at sex that weren't in my fertile window. I had to track carefully and give him several days of advance notice of when sex \"should\" happen. Then he could only stay hard in one position (both of us lying down on our sides, with me facing away from him) and only for just long enough to get the job done. Foreplay was utterly nonexistent, and any attempts I made to change things up (looking at each other, me getting on top, etc.) were rejected. I cried sometimes after sex because of how dehumanizing it felt. I can only assume he hated it as much as I did.\n\n\nThat brings us to today. Baby is seven months old, and DH and I have not had sex since I got my positive pregnancy test -- about 16 months total. And the thing now is, I don't care. I have lost so much love and desire to bond with him that I just don't care if I never have sex with him again. I remember the desires that I still had after my firstborn, and they are just completely, 100% gone. He obviously doesn't care, and now, finally, thankfully, neither do it.\n\n\nSo here I am, in a sexless, romance-less coparenting relationship. We don't sleep in the same room or even hug and kiss or say \"I love you\" (except to end a phone call). And the thing is, I don't even want to be his friend, if that makes sense? The other week, we had a rare opportunity to go out for dinner together sans kids, and he asked me if I wanted to go. I said no. Not out of spite or anything; I just genuinely didn't want to. To me it would feel like that would just be pretending and playacting at being a romantic, loving couple -- or even just a couple of pals catching up at dinner -- and I just ... don't want to playact. It feels false. I didn't say that to him, although I would've been honest if he'd asked. He looked a bit hurt but just went out by himself instead, while I enjoyed a quiet evening home by myself.\n\n\nJust getting it off my chest, I guess, because my birthday is coming up and I'm dreading him asking me if I want to go out for dinner with him. I'm hoping he just doesn't ask and we have a family dinner instead. Basically the only way I don't mind him in my space is if the kids are there too. I can cope with coparenting. Past experience has taught me exactly how much effort it takes to upgrade from coparenting, and honestly ... it's just not worth it.\n\nEDIT: Wow, this got way more attention than I ever thought. I figured I would just scream into the void a little bit before bed. Woke up and now there are so many notifications.\n\nI have errands most of the day, but I promise I will read all the comments and respond to what I can. Thank you for taking the time. To address some of the questions I've seen from briefly skimming the comments:\n\nQ: First and foremost, why did you bring another kid into this mess? A: I think this question is missing the point. It wasn't a mess when we decided to have a second kid, at least in my (perhaps deluded) view. We had reached a place in our marriage that I was happy with. This wasn't a situation of \"surely a baby will fix our broken marriage!\" This was \"our marriage has been through a rough patch but come out the other side and now we are ready to amplify our happiness.\" Maybe it was stupid, but I genuinely thought we'd overcome the challenges. I even shared my happiness in the deadbedrooms sub like the fool I was.\n\nQ: Has he been medically tested? A: Yes, after MONTHS of asking, and only if you count going to the laziest doctor in the world. It's no secret I dislike his doctor. What kind of so-called physician, hearing a healthy-looking young man come in and say \"I have no sex drive, can I have a testosterone test?\", just responds \"Sure, here's a hormone panel, bye now\" with no follow-up questions? Anyway, his testosterone is apparently normal and he doesn't want to go back to a doctor again.\n\nQ: Is he gay/asexual/addicted to porn? A: I've asked. He's denied it and disliked the line of questioning. \n\nQ: Did you get fat/stinky/undesirable after kids? A: Nope. Lost the weight quickly both times and generally take care of myself and my health (my unsatisfied physical drive notwithstanding).\n\nQ: Have you tried counselling? A: I've asked that too and he doesn't want to. I may have to force the issue or at least try individually counselling for myself.\n\nQ: Have you considered an affair? A: Not a dishonest one ... but I'm not gonna lie, I would jump at the opportunity if he said I could get a lover.",

    "text": "Are you comfortable going to a male OBGYN? To preface this, I don't think men who choose gynecology do so with any hidden agenda. That's never the issue.\n\nI've been going to the same OBGYN lady doctor for over a decade, but she retired this year. In my hunt for a new doc who accepts my insurance I was recommended one in my area by a women's clinic. The doctor's name was foreign but they said \"she sends us a lot of patients\", so I assumed it was a woman. \n\nI went in for my PAP and to get my IUD replaced. A lovely female nurse practitioner did my exam, and she scheduled me for two weeks later to get the IUD sorted since they had to order in my brand. When I came in she wasn't able to get the old one out.  I was a little freaked out but she scheduled me with the doctor for the next morning, and then I found out it was a man. \n\nI was already anxious over my stuck IUD and the possibility of it being embedded. I got very uncomfortable with him being a man, him not understanding the pain of IUD removal/ insertion. Now, he did it all very quickly but with such a lack of empathy. I'm used to women who handle my business down there being very communicative; this is my finger, this is the speculum, you'll feel cold, you will feel a cramp. This guy just went in there saying nothing and ripped the damn thing out of me. I felt like my insides were being pulled out of my vagina. I asked for a break before inserting the new one but he kept preping for insertion and saying \"I'm not doing anything yet, just cleaning\". When I said I'm ready he just went for it without telling me what's happening, and I just started tearing up between the pain and feeling so anxious and distraught. \n\nI can't help but to think had it been a woman she'd have more empathy and understand the level of pain, albeit for a short time, I was in. It would have made the process a little bit easier. The female nurse stayed in the room with me after he walked out like it was nothing to make sure I was ok. Her patience and kindness helped. He got the job done quickly, sure, but I felt dismissed in a way, and I really don't want to be in his care again. This has been my experience with every male doctor I've ever been to. \n\nHas anyone had positive experiences with male OBGYN?",

    "text": "I’m so sick of people saying women have a low pain tolerance It’s a known issue that medical professionals and physicians often ignore women’s pain and dismiss it as hysteria.\n\n[We aren’t treated the same way men are, in that a man can go to the ER and has a much better chance that people listen him.](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/women-and-pain-disparities-in-experience-and-treatment-2017100912562)\n\nWe live in a world where men get Vicodin for vasectomies and women get whatever OTC meds for childbirth, even if their is tearing or in some cases when she actually has a C-section.\n\nSo how are you gonna tell me that culturally, the gender that is taught to both ignore and deal with pain solo is some how worse at dealing with it then the gender that get legit narcotics for a simple out patient procedure? Maybe they feel less pain because of all of those prescription narcotics their given?\n\nAs a researcher, I try to be unbiased but [there is a long history regarding medical bias against women and how are pain is ignore](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-there-a-gender-bias-against-female-pain-patients_b_589b6b3ee4b061551b3e06ab/amp)\n\nSo how am I supposed to believe studies that come from that same biased community about how we as women have both a lower tolerance to pain but also experience higher levels of it for the same things?\n\nMaybe those doctors need to interview some tattoo artists or something, because they seem like the only group of people who understand that when you put both a man and a women under the same stimuli, one group is more likely to fall asleep and the other can’t seem to sit still because they claim it hurts so much.\n\nMaybe it’s that as a women, pain is life. It starts when we’re in our early teens and continues for the rest of it. Which we know pain is both subjective and  exposure and range both breeds tolerance. So if it the fact that we experience more pain that make people think we are some how are less tolerant of it? Is that the logic?\n\nMake that make sense. \n\nI have suffered from chronic pain several times in my life, I had endometriosis that took ten years to treat because no one believed me. Maybe they just lacked the references for what nerve damage due to unchecked tissue growth does to a person?\n\nMy partner was hit by a car and it permanently fucked up his spine, causing mass nerve pain. While it’s been surgically repaired, to this day, he seems to be the only guy I’ve ever met that gets my pain, understands it and recognizes it’s severity. While other people I’ve been with have described kidney stones or tooth aches as ‘the worst pain imaginable’, I wish that was the case for me. \n\nPain touches so many spaces for us in ways that men will never experience it. Seriously, thank about it. A man would never power through painful sex, if men got pregnant, abortion would be free, if men had periods Vicodin would like be a standard treatment for cramps.\n\nDo men just not have a frame of reference? \n\nIt just seems to be that this whole stance of women being less tolerant to pain isn’t even about pain but about people acting like we are weak without proof or a reference what it actually feels like to live in a female body. \n\nWhat are they trying to prove aside for finding more ways to ignore our experiences?\n\nIt’s just one more dig at us, when some days that all life seems to be, more attacks and more micro aggressions without any empathy or understanding.\n\nIt’s just really hard not to feel exhausted by all of it.\n\nEdit:\nThanks you for all for sharing your experience! It’s really heartbreaking to see how many of you have had similar experiences, it shows how much we need real change in how doctors are allowed to treat us.\n\nTo the few who ask ‘Who’s saying that?’ \nA simple search will turn up a bunch of studies that say just that. \n\nFor every one that finds women have higher pain tolerance, their are 4-5 that cite the opposite, often citing data sources that can’t provide an accurate representation of our actual experiences. At the end of the day, these studies lack any real clinical value as they do nothing to improve care or treatment of pain.\n\nFrom a behavioral standpoint pain is too varied and subjective for a single sentence conclusion. \n\nThis post is more about what people do with that information, specifically doctors, the quality of care women receive due to this inherent bias that we’re ‘faking it’ or anxious. It’s a rant. It was for everyone else who has ever felt helpless in a medical setting.",

    "text": "Good news ladies! We can't have heart attacks Tl/dr- signs say minor heart attack; cardiologist says no because I'm a woman. \n\nThis past Friday morning, I (41)woke up having the worst chest pain I've ever felt. It was literally making me nauseous. I'd been having trouble with heartburn, but this felt nothing like that. It was solid and unwavering. Remember when the guy in Indiana Jones reached into the other guy's chest to pull out his heart? I imagine this is what that felt like. Pain up through my jaw, into my shoulder and neck. Anyway, it subsided after a bit (guessing maybe 15-20 minutes?), but there was still a lingering discomfort in my chest slightly to the left. \n\nYou're probably thinking what I was - sounds like a heart attack. But I've been dismissed by doctors often enough that I have a general distaste of them, so of course I didn't go. I went about my day like the daughter of the stubborn man who raised me. \n\nThat afternoon, I was talking to my mom and told her about what happened. She, being a reasonable person, demanded I go to urgent care and be checked out because heart problems run on my dad's side like a freaking gazelle. I assured her I would… once I got home and put the groceries away. \n\nI finally make it to urgent care around 4p, called back around 430p. Doctor comes in and basically starts berating me about coming there instead of the ER if it was a heart attack, and \"Clearly it isn't a heart attack because you were on your phone when I came in. People having heart attacks aren't on their phone. Are you sure it isn't anxiety? Or heartburn? Or a pulled muscle?\" \nOk, first of all- it was this morning. Second, I didn't say it was massive. Third, my dad drove himself home over an hour to go to *his* hospital while having all the symptoms of a heart attack, so if nothing else I know there are levels. \n\nBy this point I'm crying from frustration and she finally says, \"well, all we can do is an EKG and see if anything shows up\". Fine, do that. \nShe comes back in with the EKG report and a whole different attitude and tells me to go to the ER immediately because it showed combined atrial enlargement and anteroseptal infarc. \n\nER visit is uneventful. New ECG, xray, blood draw - nothing of note. \n\nGet the blood work results the next day and go through them. I keep a spreadsheet of all my results, so I'm entering in the new numbers. I notice that my alanine transaminase and aspartate transferase numbers are way up from the draw I had last month. Like doubled. So, of course I head to Dr. Google. These two enzymes will show if there has recently been cellular damage, typically in the liver, but also *dundundun* in the heart. I come across a couple medical pages (not WebMD, don't worry) and they are explaining NSTEMI vs STEMI heart attacks. I literally had all the symptoms of an NSTEMI, including proof of recent sudden cellular damage even though the troponin test was below 3. Ok, I think to myself, it seems I have an answer. \n\nFF to this afternoon when I go see a cardiologist. Who dropped gems on me such as-\n\"It could've been a muscle spasm\"\n\"You do have a family history of heart problems? Ok, but none yourself, though?\"\n\"Yes, your blood work numbers doubled, but they're still in range so there's nothing we can do about that (referring to the #s that show cell damage)\"\nAnd my favorite, after I asked him to explain the why the initial EKG was so concerning: are you ready? \n\"Well, typically this means a heart attack had occurred, but we see it a lot in women.\"\n\nUm ok? Are you saying women don't have heart attacks? Or that you just ignore heart attacks in women?  I was flabbergasted. I'm scheduled for a stress test in two weeks, but I think I'm going to cancel and look for someone else.\n\nEdit: Y'all, I'm not saying the guy was wrong. I'm annoyed at how I was treated like there wasn't anything to worry about. Angry because he couldn't be bothered to take the time to even try and explain what the problem could've been. That he automatically assumed, without even checking my ED charts or initial EKG, that it was nothing. That when I mentioned lab results that concerned me, he brushed it off as 'in range' instead of explaining why they could be like that. \n\nI'm not disappointed I DIDN'T have a freaking heart attack jfc I'm disappointed in how I was treated when there was obviously a problem. That I was made to feel like I was making it up or I wasn't worth his time.",

I was threatened with fat camp when I was 8, dragged to weight watchers when I was 11, ‘gifted’ a personal trainer and a dietician for my 13th birthday. My siblings didn’t endure any of this, just me. I believed for nearly my whole life I was always the fattest, most unhealthy person in the room. \n\nAs I got older in my teens and early twenties, I spiraled into a nasty pattern of binging and purging. I was praised when I started losing weight, even more so when I told everyone it was because I wouldn’t eat more than 300 calories in a sitting, only eating once or twice a day. I now have semi-permanent GI issues from the amount of purging I did. \n\nThe kicker is I was never extraordinarily large. I played sports year around, was active outside of sports, and had a ferocious appetite because I was doing physical activity for nearly an hour or two a day for most of my childhood. My doctors never really had any concerns about my weight. \n\nI’ve gained some weight over the last few years; the pandemic, getting into a loving relationship, working on my relationship with food, and trying out different medications to help treat OCD and C-PTSD. I don’t have any health concerns related to weight, my doctors don’t have any concerns, and my fiancé loves my body the way it is. \n\nThe fact that my weight was my fathers concern in that moment, and that he thought it was an appropriate time to express that concern really fucking sucks. I was blind to my fathers misogyny growing up, but being with a man who treats me truly as an equal has really opened my eyes to the way my father treated me growing up. \n\nI’m not sure what i’m hoping to get out of this post. I guess I’m just frustrated and hurt and disappointed. I don’t have many friends and just wanted to vent to some people who could understand. Thanks for reading.\n\nEdit: Wow I wasn’t expecting this to blow up like it did. I so sincerely appreciate everyone who commented. I’ve never felt so validated and supported, it’s a bit overwhelming. Thank you all for your kind comments, the different perspectives brought to me, the stories shared and the advice given! ❤️ I’ve got a therapy appointment tomorrow and will be speaking with her about the best way to go no contact with my father.",

    "text": "RA Doctor making sexual comments \nI am in my 30s and have severe rheumatoid arthritis. When I was first diagnosed my previous doctor put me on the max dose of methotrexate. My body didn't react well to the methotrexate and I ended up in the hospital. \n\nFast forward I found a different doctor who was so amazing. He promised to never say the word methotrexate to me ever. He found an infusion that literally took all my arthritis away. After 3 years of being unable to lift my baby girl I was able to rock and hold her again. \n\nUnfortunately, our insurance changed and I had to find yet another doctor. Yesterday was my first appointment and he was so horrible. This man instantly hated I was on an infusion and said I needed to be on methotrexate. I told him that the arthritis in my jaws was getting worse at the beginning of my appointment. He used this as some kind of disgusting ammunition to get me to go back on methotrexate by saying, \"It'll make your husband very sad if you can't use your jaws.\" I was so shocked I didn't know how to react. Knowing this man is standing between me being able to move and enjoy life has me so angry today. \n\nI'm looking for a new doctor, but at this point I'm going to miss an infusion because he doesn't see the point of me being on it when methotrexate is available. \n\nMy husband said he'd leave it up to me whether I report him or not because he knows that our state does not believe women. I'm so disappointed. I had a brief period of no pain and being able to enjoy life again. I'm sorry I just needed to vent. It's really bothering me today.",

    "text": "The Chen 2023 Paper Raises Serious Concerns About Pediatric Gender Medicine Outcomes When I started my Child and Adolescent Psychiatry training in the 2010s, the diagnosis and treatment of gender dysphoria were rapidly becoming controversial in the field. Doctors and nurses who had spent decades on inpatient adolescent units, usually seeing one gender dysphoric child every 4-5 years, now saw multiple transgender-identifying kids in every inpatient cohort. It was a rare patient list that did not include at least one teenager with pronouns not matching their sex.\r  \n \r  \nViewpoints about this differed, with every student, resident, fellow, and attending having their own perspective. All of us wanted what was best for patients, and these discussions were always productive and collegial. While I am not naive about how heated this topic can be online, I have only ever had good experiences discussing it with my colleagues. Some of my attendings thought that this was merely a social fad, similar to Multiple Personality Disorder or other trendy diagnoses, like the rise in Tourette's and other tic disorders seen during the early pandemic and widely attributed to social media. Others, including myself early on, thought we were merely seeing psychological education doing what it is supposed to do: patients who would, in earlier decades, not realize they were transgender until middle age were now gaining better psychological insight during their teen years. This was due to a combination of increased tolerance and awareness of transgender people and was a positive good that shouldn't necessarily raise any red flags or undue skepticism.\r  \n \r  \nDuring my outpatient fellowship year, I began to suspect a combination of both theories could be true, similar to ADHD or autism, where increasing rates of diagnosis likely reflected some combination of better cultural awareness (good) and confirmation bias leading to dubious diagnoses (bad). Confirmation bias is always a problem in psychiatric diagnosis, because almost all psychiatric diagnoses describe symptoms that exist along a spectrum, so almost anyone could meet the DSM5TR criteria for any condition, so long as you ignored the severity of the symptom, and people are often not good at judging the severity of their own symptoms, as they do not know what is \"normal\" in the broader population.\r  \n \r  \nI considered myself moderate on these issues. Every field of medicine faces a tradeoff between overtreatment and undertreatment, and I shared the worries of some of my more trans-affirming colleagues that many of these kids were at high risk for suicide if not given the treatment they wanted. Even if you attribute the increase in trans-identification among teens to merely a social fad, it was a social fad with real dangers. If an influencer or spiritual guru on social media was convincing teens that evil spirits could reside in their left ring finger, and they needed to amputate this finger or consider suicide, the ethical argument could be made that providing these finger amputations was a medically appropriate trade of morbidity for mortality. \"How many regretted hormonal treatments, breast surgeries, or (in our hypothetical) lost ring fingers are worth one life saved from suicide?\" is a reasonable question, even if you are skeptical of the underlying diagnosis.\r  \n \r  \nAnd I was always skeptical of the legitimacy of most teenagers' claims to be transgender, if for no other reason than because gender dysphoria was historically a rare diagnosis, and the symptoms they described could be better explained by other diagnoses. As the old medical proverb says, \"when you hear hoofbeats, think horses and not zebras.\" The DSM5 estimated the prevalence of gender dysphoria in males as a range from 0.005% to 0.014%, and in females as a range of 0.002% to 0.003%, although the newer DSM5TR rightly notes the methodological limitations of such estimates.\r  \n \r  \nRegardless, most of the symptoms these teens described could be explained as identity disturbance (as in borderline personality disorder and some trauma responses), social relationship problems (perhaps due to being on the autism spectrum), body image problems (similar to and sometimes comorbid with eating disorders), rigid thinking about gender roles (perhaps due to OCD or autism), unspecified depression and anxiety, or just gender nonconforming behavior that fell within the normal range of human variation. It seems highly implausible that the entire field of psychiatry had overlooked or missed such high rates of gender dysphoria for so long. Some of my colleagues tried to explain this as being due to the stigma of being transgender, but I do not think it is historically accurate to say that psychiatry as a field has been particularly prudish or hesitant to discuss sex and gender. In 1909 Sigmund Freud published a case report about \"Little Hans,\" which postulated that a 5-year-old boy was secretly fixated on horse penis because of the size of the organ. I do not find it plausible that the next century of psychoanalysis somehow underestimated the true rate of gender dysphoria by multiple orders of magnitude because they were squeamish about the topic. In fact, the concept that young girls secretly wanted a penis was so well known that the term \"penis envy\" entered common English vocabulary! Of course, the psychoanalytic concept of penis envy is not gender dysphoria per se, but it is adjacent enough to demonstrate the implausibility of the notion that generations of psychoanalysts downplayed or ignored the true rate of gender dysphoria due to personal bigotry or cultural taboo.\r  \n \r  \nTherefore, for most of my career I have been in the odd position of doubting my gender-affirming colleagues, who would say \"trans kids know who they are\" and talk about saving lives from suicide, but also believing that they were making the best of a difficult situation. In the absence of any hard outcome data, all we had to argue about was theory and priors. I routinely saw adverse outcomes from these treatments, both people who regretted transitioning and those whose dysphoria and depression kept getting worse the more they altered their bodies, but I had to admit this might be selection bias, as presumably the success cases didn't go on to see other psychiatrists. I could be privately skeptical, but without any hard data there was no public argument to make. The gender affirming clinicians claimed that they could correctly identify which kinds of gender dysphoria required aggressive treatment (from DSMIV-TR to DSM5 the diagnosis was changed to emphasize and require identification with the opposite gender, rather than other kinds of gendered distress and nonconformity), and even when they were wrong they were appropriately trading a risk of long term morbidity for short term mortality. There was nothing to be done except wait for the eventual long term outcomes data.\r  \n \r  \nThe waiting ended when I read the paper \"Psychosocial Functioning in Transgender Youth after 2 Years of Hormones\" by Chen et al in the NEJM. This is the second major study of gender affirming hormones (GAH) in modern pediatric populations, after Tordoff 2022, and it concluded \"GAH improved appearance congruence and psychosocial functioning.\" The authors report the outcomes as positive: \"appearance congruence, positive affect, and life satisfaction increased, and depression and anxiety symptoms decreased.\" To a first approximation, this study would seem to support gender affirming care. Some other writers have criticized the unwarranted causal language of the conclusion, as there was no control group and so it would have been more accurate to say \"GAH was associated with improvements\" rather than \"GAH improved,\" but this is a secondary issue.\r  \n \r  \nThe problem with Chen 2023 isn't its methodological limitations. The problem is its methodological strength. Properly interpreted, it is a negative study of outcomes for youth gender medicine, and its methodology is reasonably strong for this purpose (most of the limitations tilt in favor of a positive finding, not a negative one). Despite the authors' conclusions, an in-depth look at the data they collected reveals this as a failed trial. The authors gave 315 teenagers cross-sex hormones, with lifelong implications for reproductive and sexual health, and by their own outcome measures there was no evidence of meaningful clinical benefit.\r  \n \r  \n315 subjects, ages 12-20, were observed for 2 years, completing 5 scales (one each for appearance, depression, and anxiety, and then two components of an NIH battery for positive affect and life satisfaction) every 6 months including at baseline. The participants were recruited at 4 academic sites as part of the Trans Youth Care in United States (TYCUS) study. Despite the paper's abstract claiming positive results, with no exceptions mentioned, the paper itself admits that life satisfaction, anxiety and depression scores did not improve in male-to-female cases. The authors suggest this may be due to the physical appearance of transwomen, writing \"estrogen mediated phenotypic changes can take between 2 and 5 years to reach their maximum effect,\" but this is in tension with the data they just presented, showing that the male-to-female cases improved in appearance congruence significantly. The rating scale they used is reported as an average of a Likert scale (1 for strong disagreement, 3 for neutral, and 5 for strong agreement) for statements like \"My physical body represents my gender identity\" and so a change from 3 (neutral) to 4 (positive) is a large effect.\r  \n \r  \nIf a change from 3 out of 5 to 4 out of 5 is not enough to change someone's anxiety and depression, this is problematic both because the final point on the scale may not make a difference and because it may not be achievable. Other studies using the Transgender Congruence Scale, such as Ascha 2022 (\"Top Surgery and Chest Dysphoria Among Transmasculine and Nonbinary Adolescents and Young Adults\") show a score of only 3.72 for female-to-male patients 3 months after chest masculinization. (The authors report sums instead of averages, but it is trivial to convert the 33.50 given in Table 2 because we know TCS-AC has 9 items.) The paper that developed this scale, Kozee 2012, administered it to over 300 transgender adults and only 1 item (the first) had a mean over 3.\r  \n \r  \nThese numbers raise the possibility that the male-to-female cases in Chen 2023 may already be at their point of maximal improvement on the TCS-AC scale. A 4/5 score for satisfaction with personal appearance may be the best we can hope for in any population. While non-trans people score a 4.89 on this scale (according to Iliadis 2020), that doesn't mean that a similar score is realistically possible for trans people. When a trans person responds to this scale, they are essentially reporting their satisfaction with their appearance, while a non-trans person is answering questions about a construct (gender identity) they probably don't care about, which means you can't make an apples-to-apples comparison of the scores. If this is counter-intuitive to you, consider that a polling question like \"Are you satisfied with your knowledge of Japanese?\" would result in near-perfect satisfaction scores for those in the general public who have no interest in Japanese (knowledge and desire are matched near zero), but lower scores in students of the Japanese language. Even the best student will probably never reach the 5/5 satisfaction-due-to-apathy of the non-student.\r  \n \r  \nI am frustrated by the authors' decision not to be candid about the negative male-to-female results in the abstract, which is all most people (including news reporters) will be able to read. I have seen gender distressed teenagers with their parents in the psychiatric ER, and many of them are high functioning enough to read and be aware of these studies. While some teens want to transition for personal reasons, regardless of the outcomes data, in much the same way that an Orthodox Jew might want to be circumcised regardless of health benefits, others are in distress and are looking for an evidence-based answer. In the spring of 2023, I had a male-to-female teen in my ER for suicidal ideation, and patient and mother both expressed hopefulness about recently started hormonal treatment, citing news coverage of the paper. This teen had complicated concerns about gender identity, but was explicitly starting hormones to treat depression, and it is unclear whether they would have wanted such treatment without news reporting on Chen 2023.\r  \n \r  \nMoving on to the general results, the authors quantify mental health outcomes as: \"positive affect \\[had an\\] annual increase on a 100-point scale \\[of\\] 0.80 points...life satisfaction \\[had an\\] annual increase on a 100-point scale \\[of\\] 2.32 points...We observed decreased scores for depression \\[with an\\] annual change on a 63-point scale \\[of\\] −1.27 points...and decreased \\[anxiety scores\\] annual change on a 100-point scale \\[of\\] −1.46 points...over a period of 2 years of GAH treatment.\" These appear to be small effects, but interpreting quantitative results on mental health scales can be tricky, so I will not say that these results are necessarily too small to be clinically meaningful, but because there is no control group these results are small enough to raise concerns about whether GAH outperforms placebo. It is unfortunate that it is not always straightforward to compare depression treatments due to several scales being in common use, but we can see the power of the placebo effect in other clinical trials on depression. In the original clinical trials for Trintellix, a scale called MADRS was used for depression, which is scored out of 60 points, and most enrolled patients had an average depression score from 31-34. Placebo reduced this score by 10.8 to 14.5 points within 8 weeks (see Table 4, page 21 of FDA label). For Auvelity, another newer antidepressant, the placebo group's depression on the same scale fell from 33.2 to 21.1 after 6 weeks (see Figure 3 of page 21 of FDA label).\r  \n \r  \nI won't belabor the point, but anyone familiar with psychiatric research will be aware that placebo effects can be very large, and they occur across multiple diagnoses, including surprising ones like schizophrenia (see Figure 3 of the FDA label for Caplyta). I am genuinely surprised and confused by how minimal this cohort's response to treatment was. Early in my career I thought we were trading the risk of transition regret for great short-term benefit, and I was confused when I noticed how patients given GAH didn't seem to get better. This data confirms my experience is not a fluke. I could go in depth about their anxiety results, which on a hundred-point scale fell by less than 3 points after two years, but this would read nearly identically to the paragraph above.\r  \n \r  \nA more formal analysis of this paper might try to estimate the effects of psychotherapy and subtract them away from the reported benefits of GAH, and an even more sophisticated analysis might try to tease apart the benefits of testosterone for gender dysphoria per se from its more general impact on mood, but I think this is unnecessary given the very small effects reported and the placebo concerns documented above. Putting biological girls on testosterone is conceptually similar to giving men anabolic steroids, and I remain genuinely surprised that it wasn't more beneficial for their mood in the short term. Some men on high doses of male steroids are euphoric to the point of mania.\r  \n \r  \nBut my biggest concerns with this paper are in the protocol. This paper was part of TYCUS, the Trans Youth Care in United States study, and the attached protocol document, containing original (2016) and revised (2021) versions explains that acute suicidality was an exclusion criterion for this study (see section 4.6.4). There were two deaths by suicide in this study, and 11 reports of suicidal ideation, out of 315 participants, and these patients showed no evidence of being suicidal when the study began. This raises the possibility of iatrogenic harm. It would be beneficial to have more data on the suicidality of this cohort, but the next problem is that the authors did not report this data, despite collecting it according to their protocol document.\r  \n \r  \nThe 5 reported outcome measures in Chen 2023 are only a small fraction of the original data collected. The authors also assessed suicidality, Gender Dysphoria per se (not merely appearance congruence), body esteem and body image (two separate scales), service utilization, resiliency and other measures. This data is missing from the paper. I do not fully understand why the NEJM allowed such a selective reporting of the data, especially regarding the adverse suicide events. A Suicidal Ideation Scale with 8 questions was administered according to both the original and revised protocol. In a political climate where these kinds of treatments are increasingly viewed with hostility and new regulatory burdens, why would authors, who often make media appearances on this topic, hide positive results? It seems far more plausible that they are hiding evidence of harm.\r  \n \r  \nOf course, Chen 2023 is not the only paper ever published on gender medicine, but aside from Tordoff 2022 it is nearly the only paper in modern teens to attempt to measure mental health outcomes. The Ascha 2022 paper on chest masculinization surgery I mentioned above uses as its primary outcome a rating scale called the Chest Dysphoria Measure (CDM), a scale that almost any person without breasts would have a low score on (with the possible exception of the rare woman who specifically wants to have prominent and large breasts that others will notice and comment on in non-sexual contexts), even if they experienced no mental health benefits from the breast removal surgery and regretted it. Only the first item (\"I like looking at my chest in the mirror\") measures personal satisfaction. Other items, such as \"Physical intimacy/sexual activity is difficult because of my chest\" may be able to detect harm in a patient who strongly regrets the surgery but is worded in such a way as not to detect actual benefit. They should have left it at \"Physical intimacy/sexual activity is difficult\" because a person without breasts can't experience dysphoria or functional impairment as a result of having breasts, even if their overall functionality and gender dysphoria are unchanged. Gender dysphoria that is focused on breasts may simply move to hips or waist after the breasts are removed.\r  \n \r  \nTordoff 2022 was an observational cohort study of 104 teens, with 7 on some kind of hormonal treatment for gender dysphoria at the beginning of the study and 69 being on such treatment by the end. The authors measured depression on the PHQ-9 scale at 3, 6, and 12 months, and reported \"60% lower odds of depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality among youths who had initiated PBs or GAHs compared with youths who had not.\" This paper is widely cited as evidence for GAH, but the problem is that the treatment group did not actually improve. The authors are making a statistical argument that relies on the \"no treatment\" group getting worse. This would be bad enough by itself, but the deeper problem is that the apparent worsening of the non-GAH group can be explained by dropout effects. There were 35 teens not on GAH at the end of the study, but only 7 completed the final depression scale.\r  \n \r  \nThe data in eTable 3 of the supplement is helpful. At the beginning the 7 teens on GAH and the 93 not on GAH have similar scores: 57-59% meeting depression criteria and 43-45% positive for self-harming or suicidal thoughts. There is some evidence of a temporary benefit from GAH at 3 months, when the 43 GAH teens were at 56% and 28% for depression and suicidality respectively, and the 38 non-GAH teens at 76% and 58%. At 6 months the 59 GAH teens and 24 non-GAH teens are both around 56-58% and 42-46% for depression and suicidality. At 12 months there appears to be a stark worsening of the non-GAH group, with 86% meeting both depression and suicidality criteria. However, this is because 6/7 = 86% and there are only 7 subjects reporting data out of the 35 not on GAH from the original 104 subject cohort. The actual depression rate for the GAH group remains stable around 56% throughout the study, and the rate of suicidality actually worsens from Month 3 to Month 12.\r  \n \r  \nWe cannot assume that the remaining 7 are representative of the entire untreated 35. I suspect teens dropped out of this study because their gender dysphoria improved in its natural course, as many adolescent symptoms, identities and other concerns do. However, even if you disagree with me on this point, the question you have to ask about the Tordoff study is why these 7 teens would go to a gender clinic for a year and not receive GAH. Whatever the reason was, it makes them non-representative of gender dysphoric teens at a gender clinic.\r  \n \r  \nThe short-term effect of GAH is no longer an unanswered question. Its theoretical basis was strong in the absence of data, but like many strong theories it has failed in the face of data. Now that two studies have failed to report meaningful benefit we can no longer say, as we could as recently as 2021, that the short-term benefits are so strong that they outweigh the potential long-term risks inherent in permanent body modification. Some non-trivial number of patients come to regret these body modifications, and we can no longer claim in good faith that there are enormous short term benefits that outweigh this risk. The gender affirming clinicians had two bites at the apple to find the benefit that they claimed would justify these dramatic interventions, and their failure to find it is much greater than I could have imagined two years ago.\r  \n \r  \nI am not unaware of how fraught and politicized this topic has become, but the time has come to admit that we, even the moderates like me, were wrong. When a teenager is distressed by their gender or gendered traits, altering their body with hormones does not help their distress. I suspect, but cannot yet prove, that the gender affirming model is actively harmful, and this is why these gender studies do not have the same methodological problem of large placebo effect size that plagues so much research in psychiatry. When I do in depth chart reviews of suicidal twenty-something trans adults on my inpatient unit, I often see a pattern of a teenager who was uncomfortable with their body, \"affirmed\" in the belief that they were born in the wrong body (which is an idea that, whether right or wrong, is much harder to cope with than merely accepting that you are a masculine woman, or that you must learn to cope with disliking a specific aspect of your body), and their mental health gets worse and worse the more gender affirming treatments they receive. First, they are uncomfortable being traditionally feminine, then they feel \"fake\" after a social transition and masculine haircut, then they take testosterone and feel extremely depressed about \"being a man with breasts,\" then they have their breasts removed and feel suicidal about not having a penis. The belief that \"there is something wrong with my body\" is a cognitive distortion that has been affirmed instead of Socratically questioned with CBT, and the iatrogenic harm can be extreme.\r  \n \r  \nIf we say we care about trans kids, that must mean caring about them enough to hold their treatments to the same standard of evidence we use for everything else. No one thinks that the way we \"care about Alzheimer's patients\" is allowing Biogen to have free rein marketing Aduhelm. The entire edifice of modern medical science is premised on the idea that we cannot assume we are helping people merely because we have good intentions and a good theory. If researchers from Harvard and UCSF could follow over 300 affirmed trans teens for 2 years, measure them with dozens of scales, and publish what they did, then the notion that GAH is helpful should be considered dubious until proven otherwise. Proving a negative is always tricky, but if half a dozen elite researchers scour my house looking for a cat and can't find one, then it is reasonable to conclude no cat exists. And it may no longer reasonable to consider the medicalization of vulnerable teenagers due to a theory that this cat might exist despite our best efforts to find it.\r  \n \r  \n\\-An ABPN Board Certified Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist\r  \n \r  \nPS - To be clear, I support the civil rights of the trans community, even as I criticize their ideas. I see no more contradiction here than, for example, an atheist supporting religious freedom and being opposed to antisemitism. If an atheist can critique both the teachings and practices of hyper-Orthodox Hasidic Judaism, while being opposed to antisemitism at the same time, I believe that I can criticize the ideas of the trans community (\"born in the wrong body\") while still supporting their civil rights and opposing transphobia in all forms.",

I know I could have saved him if the facility had any kind of pacemaker, but they were out even of transcutans ones. He died waiting an ambulance from next town that was bringing a pacemaker and was going to take him to a bigger center. He coded four times. We couldnt bring him back from the 4th.\n\nThe other one was a young lady. I didnt knew her before. She had been discharged this morning from the hospital after 3 days treating a lower extremity venous trombosis. She was brought by EMS 20 minutes into coding, probably caused by pulmonary embolism. The doctor who was on ER shift was already attending to another patient who had coded in the ER and when she saw the third very bad case coming in, she froze. I left my own patient (he had just came back from the 3rd CPR) with another doctor, a cardiologist, that had came in to help and jumped in to leadership of this new CPR as total chaos was happening. I splited the teams so we could work and made people come back to senses. I\njust realized who this new patient was after more than 20 minutes of CPR, after recognizing that she was very close to some of my cousins.\n\nWe lost everyone. The two I took charge and the other I didnt. Both of mine had more than 50 minutes of CPR each. After all this, I had to tell people I have shared a beer before how their loved ones died.\n\nThis sucks. Sorry guys, I think by this point I'm just decompressing. But I still want your opinion on funerals.",

    "text": "Thursday                                   Had an interesting Thursday, felt like sharing a journal entry. Apologies for the formatting\n\n Thursday\n\n\tI hurriedly knock, apologize for the wait, pull up my stool and sit down. Bob sits in his chair; I sit on mine. His hands are shaky today, clasping a hand written note with five items on it. “I’m tired.” Bob is an engineer by training, long since retired. He’s often understated, but always organized. “I just don’t seem to have any energy and I get short winded these days.” These are items one and two. He doesn’t look at me, just peers over his rimmed glasses at his note, neatly penned on fancy stationery with geese at the top. His wife was fond of geese, and used to be his focus during visits with me. \n\nMy mind drifts a bit. I’ve read about Bob before I stepped in the room. It’s my job, you see. I’m to fix his problems, ease his dis-ease. Set things right. But in Bob’s case, I already know he’s full of cancer. I’ve been walking with him, starting 2 years ago at diagnosis. I have been there through his cryoablation of kidney cancer. Clear cell renal carcinoma. The procedure nearly killed him, and he recovered very poorly and slowly. Bob became very confused, as is common with people with mild cognitive impairment after a large insult to their body. It looks a lot like Alzheimer’s, and is similar, in a way. The disorientation, confusion, frailty. Family was concerned he didn’t know who he was, where he was, when it was. That he was so weak and unbalanced, falling all the time. He used to lead his family, a strong patriarch. Daughters and son in laws would tell me that something just wasn’t right, that he seemed a mere shell of himself. A wraith, faded away and unable to take care of Mabel. It had been my idea to put them both in the nursing home, and a bit of paternalistic nudging saw it done. \n\nHe eventually recovered after spending many unhappy months in long term nursing care. During his stay, Mabel withered away from a myriad of conditions including paralysis of a leg, a stroke and too many birthdays. She’s been buried more than a year now. I remember signing her card from the clinic. “It was a privilege to have played a small part in Mabel’s care. Thank you for the opportunity to be a part of your lives, and my sincere condolences at your loss.” I’m sure I wrote some such platitude. I sign a few of these cards each week. Some I know better, some less well. \n\nNow it’s Bob’s turn. He is telling me that sometimes he has such terrible pain in the right flank that he cannot stay standing up to shave, and has to sit in a chair. He’s stoic, quiet, and understated, the way many octogenarian men of his generation are. I’m sure he is minimizing his pain. “I see you saw the oncologist last month. What did they tell you?” I ask. “The spot in my lung is smaller. We’re going to do another CT in a few months. Looks like it is going well,” he tells me. I’m already running behind, about 10 minutes. I have a choice, I can have him follow – up with oncology, and do a standard fatigue workup. Check some blood, some iron, talk about sleep, depression and send him on his way. I mean, he’s already seeing the oncologist for his cancer, right? They’re taking care of things. \n\n“Did they tell you that you that this cancer is going to kill you? That this is a terminal disease, and will likely be the cause of your death?” There’s a loud silence. Deafening. Bob stares at me. I look back and him and sit, perched with my legs crossed, peering back over my glasses and waiting with open body language for his response. Seconds pass. Tens of seconds. His hand shakes, and squeezes his list, crinkling the paper audibly. He knew, or at least I suspect he knew, that something was very wrong. I had read the consult notes, full of euphemisms such as “conservative approach” and “longitudinal monitoring.” I don’t like these words. Die, death, kill, fatal. These words are better. These are not nice words, but there is no mistaking their meaning. If I think a patient is going to die, I tell them “I think you are going to die.” It’s too easy to weasel out of the discomfort and couch things in medical jargon and pleasant euphemisms. \n\nThese situations often put me in mind of an apocryphal story I was told in my training. A Mexican immigrant had been at the hospital, admitted after some terrible injury. He was whisked from the emergency department to the operating room by the trauma team. As often happens, despite the best efforts of the team, this poor man succumbs to his injuries and dies. A resident, a doctor in training, is dispatched to the waiting room to break the news to family. No one in the family speaks English except the 14-year-old son. “I’m sorry to give you this news, but we’ve lost your father,” the resident solemnly intones. After the deceased’s son translates the news, the family is appropriately shocked, grieving wife, daughters and sister begin crying. The resident withdraws to give them time to grieve as a family, but when he returns in a few minutes with the attending physician and ancillary staff, the family is nowhere to be found. A harried search ensures, and the family is found wandering the hospital grounds in the parking lot and surrounding park, calling out their father’s name. He was lost, and now they have desperately gone to find him. \n\nQueue morbid laughter. The lesson here was supposed to be – always used a licensed hospital interpreter and never family members. Also use plain language and not euphemisms or expressions. “Your son is dead.” “Your wife died.” It seemed silly at the time, and I’ve never been able to verify if it was actually a true story. But I’ve had occasion to tell so many people “your baby is dead” that I can’t remember them all. But my teachers were right, because I’ve seen what happens when it isn’t said that way. \n\n After the long silence, Bob clears his throat. “Oh. I didn’t realize that it was that serious. I thought it was no big deal.” “I think your body is wearing out. This isn’t good news, and you have uncurable cancer. That’s why you’ve been so tired. That’s why you’re getting more short of breath.” \n\nBefore walking into the room, I spent 10 minutes between patients hurriedly pouring over prior testing that I had ordered and specialists had done. Normal Echocardiogram 6 months ago, EF 55%, grade 1 diastolic dysfunction, blood pressure normotensive, no significant weight gain, mild weight loss of 3 lbs in 2 months, physical exam is euvolemic today, no conversational dyspnea; my medical assistant tells me he had mild exertional dyspnea with normal Sp02 from his walk in from the waiting room. Physical exam unremarkable. Bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound done 3 months ago for hilar adenopathy with 2.8x2.1cm subpleural right mass with no evidence of lymphatic spread, surgical path of subpleural lesion consistent with renal oligometastatic disease, not a lung cancer. Suboptimal sampling of the lymph nodes. Cannot exclude regional metastasis with persistent right hilar lymphadenopathy on repeat CT chest. No clear evidence of regional recurrence in right kidney, changes consistent with post-ablation therapy, clinically correlate. New 1.8x1.6cm mass at upper pole of left kidney, concerning for renal malignancy; recommend MRI and/or tissue sampling/excision for further evaluation. No evidence of abdominal or pelvic metastasis. \n\nI am not a cancer doctor. I don’t want to be wrong. Can’t be wrong. I’m giving a terminal diagnosis. He asks me “Well, what do we do next? Can we beat this thing?” I already know the answer is no. I tell him a rehearsed script about how doctors like to fix problems, but some things cannot be fixed. That we can actually do more harm than good trying our very best. I broach the topic of hospice. He wants to know how long he has. They usually ask me this. I tell Bob that I will give a call to his oncologist, because these things are unpredictable, but that I think I would hurt him more than help by doing more tests, more needles, more tubes, more tests. I tell him that patient’s on hospice actually live longer than patients receiving aggressive care. (I doubt myself, and look up the study again for probably the 40th time, per AAFP review from 2007 showing that patients with a terminal diagnosis of cancer had a median survival that was statistically significantly longer in lung, pancreatic or metastatic melanoma by up to three months but not in colon, prostate or breast cancer. This is likely not generalizable to my patient. Evidence based medicine is a bitch). \n\nTime’s up. Time to send Bob out the door. He came here with a list of 5 things, and his chief complaint is he wants to be less tired. Instead of making him feel better, I told him he’s dying, so long and thanks for all the fish. I am now 35 minutes behind. I have 4 patients waiting. An infected butt abscess, a cold that needs a work note, a well-known-to-me patient who is a demanding hypochondriac and someone who has been waiting to get their child vaccinated so they can get back to work. I give Bob an after visit summary (what a fucking joke), some promises that I will talk to his cancer doctor, to his daughter and that I will call him later. \nTime for the next patient. I put on a smile, open the door and ask a 13 year old if he’s decided what he’s going to be when he grows up. “Did you do anything fun this summer?”\n\nSomewhere in the middle of my day I call the oncologist. He agrees it’s recurrent, metastatic and now with a probable new primary malignancy in the left kidney. Bob is not a curative treatment candidate, and a poor candidate even for palliative immunotherapy. They agree hospice is “reasonable.” “These kidney cancers are weird. Could be weeks or years. You never know.” Thanks. The oncologist asks how my father is doing, and to say hi. He’s worked with him for decades. “Still chugging along. Go “local sports team” I say.” \n\nI finish my day early somehow. I have 27 phone messages, 32 lab and imaging results, 8 cc’d notes, 14 MyChart™ messages to address. One of these is a phone call from Bob’s daughter. Bob called her and told her he “doesn’t have long,” – Provider please address, the copied message says. I call and talk with her, tell her that I talked to oncology, they agree that he’s terminal. Yes, it’s serious. No I don’t know why this wasn’t more explicit at their last visits. Yes, he has a new cancer in the left kidney. I talk about hospice. Bob and his wife Mabel and daughter had a great experience with hospice care during the end of her life (go me for early referral? #selfcare). Yes, they’d be open to visiting with hospice for admission. I call Bob and repeat everything. I call my hospice coordinator. He’s to be admitted tomorrow. Not every nurse saves lives. God made some to give out angel wings. \n\nTomorrow is Friday. TGIF.\n\n\nI stare at my computer for a bit at the end of the day. I picture Bob sitting alone in his assisted living apartment, clutching his stationery with the fabulous geese on top. Five problems. In the dark. I cry for a little while by myself, then pack up to go home. \n\n\nThursday.",

    "text": "What the Hippocratic Oath really says I remember having to recite the Hippocratic Oath during medical school inauguration, and afterwards the phrase \"First Do No Harm\" was probably engrained in our minds as its key ingredient. I'm currently reading *The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian* (Robin Lane Fox), he mentions the Hippocratic Oath in the chapter *The Eastern Greeks* that made me look up its history (I guess I was never curious enough to even wiki it). Apparently the one we recite in modern times is a [revised edition](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/doctors/oath_modern.html) from 1964. \n\nThe original version runs as \n\n>I swear by Apollo Healer, by Asclepius, by Hygieia, by Panacea, and by all the gods and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will carry out, according to my ability and judgment, this oath and this indenture.  \n>  \n>To hold my teacher in this art equal to my own parents; to make him partner in my livelihood; when he is in need of money to share mine with him; to consider his family as my own brothers, and to teach them this art, if they want to learn it, without fee or indenture; to impart precept, oral instruction, and all other instruction to my own sons, the sons of my teacher, and to indentured pupils who have taken the Healer's oath, but to nobody else.  \n>  \n>I will use those dietary regimens which will benefit my patients according to my greatest ability and judgment, and I will do no harm or injustice to them. Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked to do so, nor will I suggest such a course. Similarly I will not give to a woman a pessary to cause abortion. But I will keep pure and holy both my life and my art. I will not use the knife, not even, verily, on sufferers from stone, but I will give place to such as are craftsmen therein.  \n>  \n>Into whatsoever houses I enter, I will enter to help the sick, and I will abstain from all intentional wrong-doing and harm, especially from abusing the bodies of man or woman, bond or free. And whatsoever I shall see or hear in the course of my profession, as well as outside my profession in my intercourse with men, if it be what should not be published abroad, I will never divulge, holding such things to be holy secrets.  \n>  \n>Now if I carry out this oath, and break it not, may I gain for ever reputation among all men for my life and for my art; but if I break it and forswear myself, may the opposite befall me. – Translation by W.H.S. Jones.\n\nHere's what Fox has to say:\n\n>It is probably in the eastern Greek world that we should locate the most widely cited and endorsed of all Greek prose texts: the so-called 'Hippocratic Oath'. Doctors still contest, or appeal to, its principles, but within Greek medicine it was only the 'oath' of a minority of practitioners. There is no reason to ascribe it to the great Hippocrates, the most famous early Greek teacher of medicine who is linked to the east Greek island of Cos. Like Hippocrates himself (probably an early to mid-fifth-century doctor), its date is unknown, but its morals and ideals have been upheld for centuries as a tribute to 'Greek science'. As a 'charter text', what it says is sometimes misrepresented by those who appeal to it. It is even cited in support by those who disapprove of euthanasia. What it actually requires is that doctors swear not to assist poisoners, rather than not to assist those who wish to be helped to die. Most modern doctors still admire the clause against the sexual harassment of patients, women as well as men, although the Greek oath also protected the persons of slaves; most doctors are less keen on the oath not to give a pessary to a woman 'to assist an abortion'. The clauses swearing to share one's livelihood with one's teacher in medicine and not to repeat gossip heard in the course of everyday life, outside professional hours, disqualify even the most admiring modern doctors from the halo of the Hippocratic Oath's observance.",

    "text": "dealing with death Dealing with death\n\nHello everyone,\n\nPlease note, this is not a bash on medical staff, my family are doctors and I have the utmost respect and love.\n\nI am a clinical nurse consultant. I normally work in the emergency department as a clinical nurse and have for 10 years.\n\nI recently joined a team of nurses whom bring critical care knowledge to the ward and review and keep and eye on patients whom have risk of deteriorating.\n\nWorking within an emergency environment I see death all the time but I'm not the one making the calls with life and death. \n\nI am struggling months later to deal with a death of a patient. The clinical nurse consultant role is also expanded to respond to medical emergency calls secondary to deterioration. \n\nI had a page to a MET call for a patient who was in mild/mod respiratory distress. Two doctors were present, both looking at the computer trying to figure out this man's history. He had nasal prongs on and hypoxia. The doctors asked for a face mask oxygen and I told them to change to a non rebreather mask as hypoxia was worsening. By the time I had arrived no one had done an ECG. Whilst they gathered the ECG machine I had to get a nurse to me his history. I also asked for an acute resus plan - he was not for CPR. His condition worsened and I had PE (no risk factors) or STEMI on my list of differentials. ECG was not overtly concerning initially, during this time the doctors were trying to get in contact with their consultant.\n\nMy next plan was to call a code however he lost cardiac output and a code team (emergency department team) would be of little benefit as he was not for CPR. \n\nI have played the scenario around in my head for weeks. The gentleman deteriorated so quickly, thrombolysis went through my head but time was not on our side.\n\nDue to the doctors virtually saying nothing in the MET call I feel his death burden is on me.\n\nOne thing I have learnt is that I have a new found respect for our medical profession whom have to have this weight on their shoulders day in and day out and I hope you know that you're so appreciated.",

The only thing anyone has been right about is that Statins can cause slow deterioration of muscle tissue, which is hardly of issue to my dad who is a non-compliant diabetic and alcoholic with blood pressure issues and a heart problem that was diagnosed 5 years ago that he hasn't taken medication for in 2+ years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I guess the point of this rambling is just to ask...

    "text": "I had the chance to save someone, and I failed. And now she's gone forever. Working in OB is a  trip. It's a great cross-section of humanity, and it brings you face to face with things you only hear about in documentaries. Domestic violence, SA, drugged up moms, some of the strangest and most awful family dynamics you've ever imagined. These are all things I see on a semi-regular basis.\n\nThere are patients that touch your heart in a good way. First time parents in their late 30s who finally got pregnant with the help of IVF, both crying over their newborn. 3-day inductions who work so hard and so long to get their baby out safely, who turn inward on their pain and go through it because they know it's the best thing they can do. Dad's who jump up when babies are brought in to breastfeed so they can be present and helpful when their partners are struggling to keep their eyes open.\n\nThen there are patients that touch your heart in the worst ways. The ways that stay with you for always. The awful sounds a mom makes when they realize their baby is gone from this world. The women whose eyes go horribly blank and dead whenever they're touched to protect the hurt and trauma they've buried inside of them. The rainbow of bruises across the abdomen of a battered woman.\n\nDid you know that the #1 cause of death in pregnant women is domestic violence?\n\nThere was a woman. A girl, really. Someone who will stay with me always. Someone who I'll never forget, and who my soul will never forgive me for not saving. Not only was she disabled, severely, both mentally and physically, but she was a victim of human trafficking. She'd been sold, by her husband, to a man listed on the sex offender list, a man who had been convicted of \"violent rape of a person 0-14 years of age\". According to the website. According to his file. She'd been bought and paid for, as was the child in her womb. She stayed with us for 3 nights. For 3 nights, I tried to save her. I called every hotline, put in every consult, informed every authority that I could that she was here with us, without him, and it was imperative that we get her out of this terrible situation.\n\nShe had 3 nights in the hospital with us. But she'd had 9 months in the office with our doctors. Our doctors, who made an appointment for her to be seen at a higher acuity hospital, in order for her to be declared a dependent adult. It would have given her an advocate of the state, who could have given her resources, a place to live, a way out. Obviously, her traffickers did not take the opportunity to drive her to this appointment. Instead of following up, instead of making sure she had a way to go to that appointment, our doctors shrugged it off and moved on to their next patient.\n\nI love my doctors. I have a very good relationship with all but one of them. We work closely together toward the same goal: Happy, healthy moms and babies. But on night 3, after hanging up with the last hotline on my list, after being told \"I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do\" one final time, I sat down with one of my doctors, and I unloaded. I cried at work. I never cry at work. I cried, and I raged, and I seethed, and I bitched. I told her that this was HER fault. It was THEIR fault that this woman, this woman we could have saved, now had a tubal ligation and would be discharged in the morning, back to her traffickers, when we could have stopped it. She sat silently with me, only offering murmurs of affirmation and comfort when I took a break to breathe. She accepted responsibility and apologized. To the patient, and to me. No matter the guilt and resentment I have for our doctors and for myself, I'll always give her credit for being patient and accepting responsibility.\n\nThe girl is gone. I'll never see her again. Her baby is safe, our one saving grace. We fought hard for them both, but in the end, the baby was the only one we could save. She was adopted by a loving family in a different state. But the girl is gone.\n\nI don't know how to get over this. I don't think I ever will. There's no moral here, no succinct or happy ending. She's gone, and we're to blame.",

    "text": "Man on drugs walked into my SNF last night thinking it was drug rehab Using my throw away for this. I’m a nurse at a rehab/SNF/post acute on the hospital campus but like half a mile away from the main hospital building. Last night, I was sitting at the nurses station around 9 PM when our CNA saw a man at the door wanting to come inside. This is not unusual at all, because we have visitors and people’s personal sitters, patients DoorDash, pharmacy couriers, etc. in and out at all hours, and although the doors are locked after 8 PM, staff will just come open the door for people.\n\nThe CNA opened the door for this average looking twenty something year old 6 foot tall man thinking he was here to visit a patient. Instead, he told her he was actively on pcp and needed help. She got the charge nurse, and I went over there too because all the other nurses were passing medications. The charge nurse told the man what kind of rehab facility this was, but that she would call a doctor for him. He was very paranoid. Charge nurse told him to sit down in our little waiting area and I asked him if he wanted water. Then he started saying he should just leave, charge nurse and I tried telling him it was fine if he stayed and we wanted to get him medical help. The guy then turned around and started trying to open the front doors, which are automatically locked after 8 PM. When he discovered the doors were locked, he became extremely paranoid and started running all over the facility.\n\nThe charge nurse then hung up with hospital security (who are half mile away at the main campus and only drive golf carts) and called 911. While she was on the phone with 911, the man was running down 1 of the rehab halls with the most acute patients (who’s doors were mostly open), and busted out the back fire exit which set off alarms. Of course, everybody’s call light is now going off because they’re scared, witnessed what happened, and are unable to ambulate independently to protect themselves!\n\nThe police and hospital security arrived and were searching inside and outside for the guy for a while, but never found him.\n\nAnd it was at that moment I realized we don’t have fucking adequate security, and if that guy had had some psychotic episode or hallucinations and tried to kill any of us or hold residents hostage, he very well could have.",

But meanwhile I was praying harder than I ever had that this man would die. He doesn't. Survives with 5 broken ribs.

They must be responsible!! They must have known and were hiding it!!” \n\nI was just shocked that so many people could say that. As the incident is so tragic and unusual, I don’t think there is anyone on earth that would notice possible symptoms of pregnancy (if the victim did have any symptoms) and assume a patient who is unable to move or talk would be pregnant. You would assume literally anything else first, gastro, gallstones etc..\n\nAnd how the sole responsibility and blame for so many people is for the female nursing staff. Not even the man who assaulted her. Not any doctor. Her family also come to visit her regularly, did they not notice any change and assume she's pregnant? Are they responsible?\n\nThe doctor actually did order an ultrasound, but it was refused by the insurance company. Which means that the nurses did notice anyway! \n\nIt’s just so tiring that so many of the general public seem to have something against female nurses. \n\nAnd on a side note, at the hospital ortho unit I work at we don’t track periods.

If something is off speak up, you are not broken!\n\nMy student teaching experience at a certain UW college has stuck with me and I cannot shake it. It also negatively impacted others in my program as well. \n\nWhat I realize now, looking back, was a girl who was burnt out and had no idea how to ask for help. I constantly felt like shit compared to others in my program who seemed to have zero issue pulling all nighters and creating the most beautiful of lessons. \n\nThe head of the school of Education shamed me for missing an orientation that I had already communicated I couldn’t make it too and there seemed no issue. She called me unprofessional and immature as I sobbed in her office begging to have a chance to student teach. She also was pissed I had not informed her my parents gave me their old rusted out car to drive to a student teaching placement where the teacher SPECIFICALLY requested me. She was mad because I could have then done a placement 40 miles outside of town. \n\nI found out in February I had two chronic health conditions that required frequent doctors visits, testing, new medications, and figuring out the world of insurance. The head of the School of Education got upset because I kept leaving an hour early occasionally to go to said doctors appointments instead of focusing on Student Teaching. \n\nMy ESL placement was once a week for a STUDY HALL. That I had to make lessons for. Understandably the high schoolers trying to use their STUDY HALL to STUDY were pissed. The teacher of that study hall was constantly dropping her trauma on me, including her sexual trauma and past abuse from former partners. When my ESL advisor asked me how things were going I grinned and said “great!” One week before graduation this ESL teacher said she would not sign off on my teaching skills so I have a minor in ESL but no actual license to teach it. \n\nThe only saving grace was my Social Studies placement 4 days a week. My co operating teacher even researched my new medical conditions so he could better understand and listen. He was and is an amazing man. \n\nI went into teaching, burnt out, zero self esteem, and lost. I made it 4 years and got the fuck out. I’m in corporate now and never looking back. \n\nCurrent student teachers: You are amazing. You have inherent value. And you deserve to be heard. Do not let anyone devalue you or your experience.

    "text": "Louisiana House Republicans Cut Education Funding to Pay Off Retirement Debt – Who Needs Teachers Anyway? In a move that would make the Smoking Man proud, House Republicans in Louisiana have decided that the best way to save money is to cut funding for education and pay off public employee retirement debt instead.\n\nIf you were wondering why Louisiana ranks 50th in education, wonder no more. House Republicans have finally found a solution to the state's education woes – just get rid of the teachers! Who needs qualified educators when you can have unqualified volunteers running the classrooms? It's like they say, if you can read this, thank a teacher. If you can't, thank a Louisiana House Republican.\n\nBut why stop at eliminating teacher pay raises? Why not just eliminate teachers altogether? After all, it's not like we need educated citizens to run our state or anything. Who needs critical thinking skills, scientific literacy, or an understanding of history when you can just Google everything, right?\n\nOf course, we can't forget about the children. They may not be old enough to vote or make campaign contributions, but they can sure be a nuisance with all their learning and growing and stuff. So why not just cut early childhood education programs too? Who needs to invest in our future when we can just pay off debt?\n\nBut don't worry, it's not all doom and gloom. House Republicans have graciously decided to retain university faculty pay raises. Because, you know, it's not like we need educated college graduates to enter the workforce or anything. Who needs doctors, lawyers, engineers, or scientists when you can just have uneducated politicians running the show?\n\nIn conclusion, the Louisiana House budget plan is a perfect example of why we need to elect officials who prioritize education and invest in our future. Unless, of course, we want to continue living in a world where ignorance is bliss and the truth is out there, but no one knows what it is.",

When I was 18, I moved to California from Texas because I had a girlfriend there and my parents didn’t want anything to do with me after coming out as transgender. I spent two years working retail and absolutely craving a job that I felt was going to give me a sense of accomplishment. Food service workers truly have my respect because I can not do that job. I got my shit together, moved back, and started college pursing a degree in secondary English education. Through subbing, however, I’ve found I enjoy the elementary levels. I was ecstatic when they asked me to be a long term sub for a second grade class that had run off the other long term sub- it was full time work (no more opening frontline and patching together a work week) and hey, I knew and liked those kids, even if they were shitheads. \n\nI had a *stressful* but very good first week. The kids weren’t the bad part, cleaning up the paperwork mess of the other sub was the hardest part, all while keeping up with new lesson plans. I took a lot home this week. \n\nI see fellow education majors that are gushing about student teaching in this weird sense of “I LOVE my babies and I want to be SO invested in their life” to where it erases the professionalism of it all, and that’s definitely not me, but I do really care about the kids I work with in the sense that I know they need stability, routine, and consistency in their teacher/class now more than anything. I also take pride in being the “fun” teacher. We can walk down the hall like robots IF we’re dead silent robots. The other grouchy veteran teachers don’t do that sort of stuff. \n\nI’ve been going to work a bit sick for a few days, and I found out I have strep throat last night. I woke up today and could barely talk, and it still hurts to swallow. I also have fever. There was no way to contact the school until this morning. I left a voicemail at 6:30, which I typed before hand: \n\n“Hi there, this is GhostShark55. I’ve been battling what I believed to be a sinus infection for a couple days, last night I felt extremely bad so I went to urgent care where they told me I have strep throat. \n\nI’m really uncomfortable with calling out sick because of the sub shortage, and not to mention I and lots of in classroom stuff to do. I also don’t want the wonderful team of teachers I work with to think I’m lazy. \n\nI’m also equally uncomfortable coming to work today and just not saying anything about my strep throat, because I know at the sub training I attended they said to stay home if you have fever, which I currently do. \n\nHere’s where I’m at: I’m awake, I’m getting dressed, planning to get intro my truck and drive up there like normal, I’m just hoping someone can call me back so if I’m asked to stay home we can minimize the disorganization for the kids. Thanks.” \n\nShe called me back and was PISSED. Telling me my class is going to suffer today, and they don’t have anybody. I felt like I was 14 again getting yelled at for leaving a cup on the counter. \n\nI know that I should look in the mirror and say, “This is a real crap school. You know that all the sub has to do is get with the other teachers and make copies of worksheets to survive the day. Take care of yourself man.” \n\nI just need some help reaching that mentality and if you could leave a comment reassuring me I did the right thing, I would be grateful. \n\nI’m thinking I’m going to get in trouble for my desk being a mess and not preparing for my absence tomorrow. I think there was a doctors note a kid put on my desk at the end of the day I was planning on turning in this AM. I don’t know. I’m scared. I also know they were looking at me for a job.",

    "text": "The time my employer contested my unemployment claim, and the unemployment agency read all my write ups and my written responses to me in the hearing Just remembered how hysterical this was and thought I’d share exactly how this went, worked for a place for about 3 years before a stupid piece of shit was given the title of manager and fired me for things out of my control\n\nThe unemployment hearing went like this\n\nUnemployment agent: “Alright so I’m gonna read the verbal/written disciplinary actions your employer sent us to contest termination”\n\nMe: “sweet, yeah go ahead”\n\nUnemployment agent: “so first we have a verbal, states ‘while managing shift, an employee working under you was performing work unsafely by doing work without safety glasses’,\n\n your response to this verbal was\n\n ‘I do not accept this write up, I was managing the shift, not babysitting the shift. I can’t be expected to watch every employee like a hawk the entire shift while doing my other duties, go write that person up instead’\n\nMe: “yes that is entirely factual”\n\nUnemployment agent: alright moving on, next we have a verbal for \n\n‘overuse of shop supplies, we have run out of gloves and safety glasses twice in a months time. someone is stealing this items, this is unacceptable’. \n\nDo you have a response to this?\n\nMe: “yes! I was literally written up for people not using enough safety glasses, then written up for using too many. I didn’t write a response on that one because I demanded an appeal to have it taken off my record, they refused, so we can just move on to my next write up”\n\nUnemployment agent: “next we have a verbal action stating\n\n ‘due to the system being unable to remove previous written action, this write up is being written to absolve the previous write up. And to clarify that they were not at fault and did not personally steal any supplies’…….\n\nMe: ah yes, that is correct\n\nUnemployment agent: alright moving on, here we have a verbal for\n\n ‘failing to meet standards when performing audits, inventory management is imparative’, \n\nyour written response is\n\n ‘your having me perform audits without training, counting isn’t the issue, I don’t know how to adjust for what the computer system takes out the day prior. Train me and it will be correct’\n\n any response?\n\nMe: “I’d also like to add at this point I had resigned from a management position, and I was only doing audits because I’m not an ass hole..”\n\nUnemployment agent: “please refrain from cussing during this interview”\n\nMe: “sorry, but it wasn’t my job description to do them, I had zero training on it, and I was only shown how to do it correctly months later when next management took over”\n\nUnemployment agent: “next we have a written action stating\n\n ‘you were speeding in company vehicle, safety is 1 priority’\n\nMe: “this one’s my favorite, response speaks for itself. I was on vacation for 2 weeks and a week after I came back is when I found out I had been written up, I didn’t even work the day they claim, boss threw  that write up at me their last day before transferring so I couldn’t argue with them”\n\nUnemployment agent: “response reads\n\n ‘what? Lol I was speeding on an unknown day, at an unknown speed, for an unknown amount of time, at an unknown location? What?”\n\nMe: “hmmmmmm, correct”\n\nUnemployment agent: “we’re running out of time here so try to keep responses short, only few minutes and then I have to move to my next call. Next is a written for attendance stating\n\n‘you have missed a full week of work, this behavior is unacceptable regardless of circumstances’ you never acknowledged this action, do you have a response?\n\nMe: “you bet I do, I hit a deer, went to hospital, provided doctors note, argued with new management, wrote HR who told me they have no attendance policy to ‘give their managers the authority to do as they deem fit regarding attendance’ and when I was fired later they brought this up when I had the insurance check in my hand for a new car, and I have that entire conversation on audio\n\nUnemployment agent: “we have several more write ups but we’re out of time, we’ll make a determination next week, if you’d like to appeal blah blah blah”\n\nMe: “Aw man comon, we’re just getting to the good stuff, can’t you stay longer? I don’t want to be denied for their insanity “\n\nAgent: “sir no, we can’t”\n\nMe: “then just let me tell you about the last one where I was fired for attendance and “safety concerns” regarding their surveillance video that explicitly proves the opposite”\n\nAgent: “I’m hanging up now, good bye”\n\nClick….\n\nAnyway, I was later approved for unemployment benefits lol this is paraphrasing as I rambled on about how they’re dumbfucks nonstop throughout the interview lol interview was only 10 minutes though which is stupid considering the amount of illogical write ups I was given, was at least 4 more to cover",

    "text": "You shouldn't be afraid to call them out We live in a world that rewards those that garnish the livelihood of others. Where rich, wealthy executives control our time, housing, food and resources. The term \"Don't bite the hand that feeds you\" is a term created to stop any sort of accountability for those that dictate our lives. Most of us will go broke within 3 months if we lost our jobs. Most of us depend on our boss for food, housing, clothing and societal recognition. If you even speak out against your boss you will potentially lose all of everything you worked for at the snap of a finger. The \"boss\" controls you so you continue to bow down another day. \"I will speak out tomorrow\" you say. Then after decades of working for the company you are as dependent as you ever were. So you continue to toil and toil for the people who have it all. Yachts, housing, investments, and more than you could ever even dream of. You work for them and depend on the little scraps they give you. Barely enough to survive. I know you want something more. I know you want to rid yourself of the leash that binds you to a job you do not enjoy and finally be free of the dependency that comes with being a unwitting victim of the system.\n\nThe only way you will get anything is if you speak out. If you continue to work 80 hour weeks with no vacation and unlivable wages you will continue to do that for the rest of your life. No magic change will occur. there is no savior that will suddenly give you what you want. You have to fight for it. Tell your boss to give you what you want or he can go F\\*ck himself. Your services have generated these companies millions if not billions of dollars...yet you can't even afford to buy a house, healthy food, and a doctors visit. There is no \"Good workers\" there are no \"bad workers\" We are all victims to the system of perpetual inequality and exploitation. Your only value to them is your commitment to allowing them to drain you of all your talents, time and labor. You sell 1000 dollars worth of merchandise and only get paid 10 dollars an hour for your service. They have the money they just dont want to give it to you. They don't respect you as a human instead they treat you like a dog. \"Sit!\" \"Stand!\" \"Smile!\" \"Follow\" \"Obey!\" For 12 hours a day you do the bidding of others and can't even find happiness. You shuffle back and forth to work grasping for time to do what you really want. But you are always coming up short. Your job will slowly drain the life out of you...one exploitative shift after the next. Yet you continue to do nothing about it but keep your head down and do as you are told.\n\nIf all of the working class stood up and demanded to be paid fairly we would be paid fairly. Look how steadily wages increased during the \"Worker shortage\". Jobs that paid 7 dollars an hour paid 15 dollars an hour. The system of capitalism can not function without workers. Do not be afraid to demand what you want. The illusion of \"replaceability\" has been destroyed. These companies are on their knees because of lack of workers. If we are not going to be paid a livable wage in the first place, then is there any point in working at all? Do not be afraid to lose your job for speaking out. There is always another job, yet there is only a finite amount of people willing shovel sh\\*t for someone elses profit. We are humans. All we need is food, water, and shelter to survive. But the job market has complicated all that. \"Companies\" have become a middle man that's gatekeeping access to a sustainable life. Most people will never own a home even though the tally of their labor is more than any house could ever be worth. But the system does not allow it. There must always be artificial scarcity so CEO's can profit from it. Nobody has to participate in this market and nobody should be shamed into leaving it. Workers are tired of being treated like garbage while making others rich. We need to expose just how useless corporations are without workers. Stop blindly obeying upper management when upper management is just a tool to keep your wages as low as possible while brainwashing you into being okay with it.",

Why, it was just the other way. You were all as nervous as cats about Communism; and you watched Craken like a wolf. Of course. Communism is a heresy; but it isn’t a heresy that you people take for granted. It is Capitalism you take for granted; or rather the vices of Capitalism disguised as a dead Darwinism. Do you recall what you were all saying in the Common Room, about life being only a scramble, and nature demanding the survival of the fittest, and how it doesn’t matter whether the poor are paid justly or not? Why, that is the heresy that you have grown accustomed to, my friends; and it’s every bit as much a heresy as Communism.

    "text": "A loose timeline of my past two years of work Hello everyone, I’ve been having a tough time at work recently, and need some sort of catharsis so I decided to write down everything that’s happened to me at work for the past two years. This is long, and I won’t blame you for not finishing it, but I just wanted to get it out into the world. To answer some questions off rip, I won’t be naming and shaming. If by some miracle you do figure out what the name of the company is or I slipped up somewhere or something, PLEASE do not contact them, or review bomb them, or anything else. I still work for this company, and need the money. All names have been changed to protect myself a little bit. Anyway-\n\nAt the beginning of September 2021 I moved to Oregon. As I moved out here without knowing anyone, or having a job lined up, I spent the first month applying to every job I could. It didn’t matter what the job was. So long as I had some form of income rolling in the actual job didn’t matter. At the end of that September I got an interview at this winery. Tara interviewed me. She was the manager of all front facing operations. She was courteous and nice. She asked me about my work experience, and I told her about how I was a Wine club manager, tasting room manager, event planner, talent booker, shipping manager, and admin worker at a winery back home. All of those titles were at the same job. Not only were they at the same job, but they were all rolled into one position that I had. Basically every job required to keep a winery running outside of scheduling employees for their shifts. That privilege was reserved for the owner of the winery.\n\nA month after I started at this winery Tara complained about how they were still searching for someone to fill their empty management position. I reiterated all of my experience in a management position at a winery. Tara told me “Oh, that’s great! We all have to wear a lot of hats around here, so it’s good to have someone with your experience to help out.” … cool.\n\nA few weeks after that Tara pulled me aside and told me “Hey, we’re trying to phase out baseball caps. We feel they just aren’t sharp enough. But we have hats that are branded that you can wear!” Now I am a bald man. I wear hats in the summer to keep the sun off my head, and I wear hats in the winter to keep my head warm. Baseball hats are the only kind that I’ve found fit my style and general vibe. The hat that Tara brought out to me? A trucker hat. How are trucker hats MORE sharp than a baseball hat? Also, those issues I talked about that baseball hats solve? A trucker hat has a mesh back. It doesn’t solve any of the problems a baseball hat does.\n\nA couple weeks after that Tara came up to me and told me they were “phasing out” hoodies as well. I was wearing a winery branded hoodie. She said that they allowed them during harvest time, but as that time was coming to a close they were phasing them out.\n\nOver the course of all this time they had filled that management position Tara kept complaining about. They hired someone from outside of the company for it. A shame as I would’ve liked to move into that role, but whatever. I’m flexible.\n\nIn addition to filling that position; there was another server who worked in the tasting room with me-Steve. Steve started 2 months before me. He had about 20 years on me. 3ish months after I started he was given a key to the place. That way if he showed up before management he could unlock the building. Steve was our worst server. He would spend 45 minutes talking to one table, meanwhile his other 2 tables have been waiting for their next pours for a half hour. We all had to cover for him by giving his other tables their wines. Steve’s story will become even more relevant later.\n\nAbout 6 months after I started I had my 90 day review. Yes you did that math right. Shea (The new hire for the management position) and Tara sat me down in the office and gave me my review. I was seen favorably by everyone- management, coworkers, and customers. I hadn’t received a single negative review thus far from any customers. (Later I would go on to get 3 over the course of my two years working there. Two of which were not about me, but instead about either feeling rushed by their out times as they wanted to stay longer, but we needed their tables for the next group. And the last one was because I brought the customers the case of wine they had just purchased to their table, but there wasn’t enough room on the table, and all other tables around them had other customers so I put the case on the ground next to them. Their complaint was that it was hard for their 70 year old husband to bend down and pick up the 50 pound box of wine. Fair enough, I thought I was giving better service by bringing the case to you, but next time I’ll ask.)\n\nAt the end of the 90 day review they asked me if I had any comments or criticisms for the management team. I said yes. They seemed taken aback. I told them about how I had been talked to twice about my attire. And yet I had never once been given an employee handbook to review the dress code for myself. They gave that awkward laugh people give when they don’t really care all that much. And talked about how the owner of the company had made the dress code intentionally vague. Something about “dress like you’re selling $100 bottles of wine” or something along those lines. Didn’t really give a reason why he made it as such. Also told me they had an employee handbook kept at all times in a wall mounted folder holder just outside in the hallway connected to all the offices. I still wasn’t offered an employee hand book for my own records. I also said that the solution to the hat issue they gave me made no sense. How is a trucker hat sharper than a baseball hat? The only difference I can see is that the trucker hat was branded, and my baseball hats weren’t. And that if the issue was the branding I would be happy to go out and spend my own money to get a custom branded hat. More awkward laughter.\n\nI also told them that while I enjoyed working with Shea, and that she was a great manager, I found it strange that they hired from outside of the company rather than promote from within. I reiterated that I had the necessary experience for that position. Tara told me she didn’t know I was interested in that position. I reminded her how I had brought up my experience twice while they were searching for someone to fill that position, one of those times in direct response to her complaints. She told me I should have explicitly said I was interested. “We’re our own biggest advocates, ya know?”\n\nThey then asked me, seeing as that position had been filled, which position would I be interested in instead. I talked about how basically all the positions I had experience in were filled, but we needed a tasting room lead. I would be interested in that position. They seemed receptive. Told me they would keep that in mind. No, mind you, the tasting room lead position had been empty my entire time at the company. They could have offered it at any time. Even now there was no offer. They simply told me they’d keep it in mind.\n\nA week later Shea approached me. She told me “Hey, I know at your review you said you were interested in the tasting room lead position. I also remember how you thought it strange we hired from outside of the company. I just wanted to tell you in person, that way you could hear it from one of us in the management team in person and aren’t surprised, but we hired someone from outside of the company to fill that position. We just feel she has a stronger drive to make phone sales campaigns. She’ll start next week. We’ll make sure to keep you in mind for any other opportunities though!”\n\nThat next week I met the new manager (Edit: tasting room lead, not manager) Janice. She was very cool. Very sarcastic, very blunt. But neither of those were in a shitty way. She didn’t talk to people as if she was better than them. She advocated for us servers to the management team as much as possible. She continuously pushed for us to raise our tip percentages. Our tips screen back then (and to this day) defaulted to the “no tip” option, and went 5%, 10%, 15% from there. The industry standard for the Willamette Valley starts at at least 10%. Some start at 15% and go to 18%, 20%, then to 25%.\n\nI never blamed Janice for taking the position. Of course I didn’t. It wasn’t her fault the management passed me up for a promotion… again. Her and I struck up a friendship. She would call me every so often to keep me updated on goings on at the winery that I hadn’t yet heard about, as well as call me out when I started to slip up in my duties at work (I have a tendency to operate in waves. The first 3 months I fuck up a lot as I’m new, the next 3 months I become a star pupil and become one of the best employees, then I get very comfortable at the job and my mind wanders and I begin to forget things. I’ve always been this way at every job. I’ve gotten very lucky at most of my jobs to have managers who recognize this and kindly call me out when I start to slip).\n\nA month after I started she called me on my day off. She told me that I had to shape up. “Management might not talk to us in the tasting room much, but they talk to each other a lot. We discussed your role at the management meeting today. They’d been considering moving you into a management position at the sister winery, but Dave (The GM of the sister winery) saw you vaping by the dumpsters, and decided he didn’t want you there.”\n\nOur campus has multiple buildings all clustered near each other. The part that customers see is about 15-20% of the total of the campus. The dumpsters are about a quarter of a mile away from where any customer could see, obscured by several buildings between those points. It wasn’t as if I wasn’t working either. I wasn’t on a smoke break. We don’t get actual breaks in the first place. I was taking things to the dumpsters to throw away, and just happened to hit my vape while working. I saw Dave that day as well. He was at our dumpsters throwing some stuff away for the sister winery. We exchanged pleasantries. He seemed unperturbed at the time. Something I’ve noticed quite a bit at this winery. People don’t tell you you’re doing something wrong. Even people in management. Even the owner. They all go to the big front facing manager and let her handle it. I’ve always been the type to tell people right away when something they do bothers me. And I -disappointingly- expect the same from them in return. I informed Janice that if me vaping where no customer could see me, while I was still working disqualified me from a management position with this company then it wasn’t my loss, but theirs. Which she agreed about, but told me to not vape around any more management.\n\nAlso during this time our marketing manager approached me asking if I wanted to get my picture up on the company website. I had worked there for over half a year, and they had yet to put me up there. Shea, who started months after me, had gotten hers on the website maybe a month after she started. I said yes I would like to get my picture up. It took another 2 months after that conversation for the marketing manager to take my picture. Now, a year and a half later my picture still isn’t up on the website. However this is more my fault than theirs as they emailed me a questionnaire to add to the picture, and I never filled it out as I rarely check my emails. I also wasn’t a big fan of the pictures as I had an outfit picked out to wear for them, but the marketing manager approached me out of the blue one day and asked if I was ready to take them. I could have said no. That one’s on me I suppose.\n\nAfter this cluster of conversations we had a team meeting to prepare us for the summer months. We were officially introduced to Janice, and informed of some of the changes that would be made over the next coming weeks. This meeting was set for after work. I live about 40 minutes away from the job. I’m a big ole nerd, so every Thursday at the time I would watch Critical Role on Thursday nights. CR starts at 7, this meeting started after we closed at 5 and went on for around an hour and a half. Now during this meeting I would occasionally pull out my phone to check how much time I had left until CR started, and if I would make it home in time (I didn’t).\n\nThe next day we did a staff tasting. Every week during the summer someone from around the company would bring in 4-6 wines for the whole company to try. It was more of an educational thing than actually tasting them for enjoyment. For example, one week someone brought in a bunch of Left Bank Bordeaux wines, then the next week we tried a bunch of Right Bank wines to compare the difference. Well at this tasting someone asked a question about if one of our vineyards was still the largest in our particular AVA, or if another one had overtaken ours. No one had the answer, so I pulled out my phone and googled the sizes of each, informed the group that ours was still the largest, then put my phone away. Later that day Shea pulled me aside to tell me I couldn’t be on my phone so much. Initially I was confused as it had been so brief both times that I completely forgot about them after my phone was put away. I informed her of the reasons I was on my phone, and that I wasn’t simply texting or something, and she told me she understood, and to just be more mindful next time.\n\nA couple weeks after that, on a busy Saturday Janice, Steve, and another coworker were hanging out in the kitchen. They were all hoping to go home early. It was a busy day, however they had all finished the last of their tables an hour before we officially closed, and the rest of us could handle closing down the business without them. While they were talking Janice mentioned how she was annoyed that Tara hadn’t given them the go ahead to leave yet. Tara walked in as she was saying that. “Then go home.” Tara angrily retorted. Janice tried to stammeringly explain herself, but Tara shut her down, and just repeated her three word statement. Janice left.\n\nThe next day Janice called me to tell me about what had happened. She told me to watch out for myself just in case, as she was unsure if she’d be able to keep her job, and what that would mean for me. She told me to take a long hard think about what I wanted out of this job, and what I wanted from my life.\n\nA few days later, on one of my days off, she called me again. She informed me that she had been fired. In addition to that she informed me of some of the petty BS that Tara had pulled in the days leading up to firing Janice. Weeks prior to the incident Janice, Tara, Shea, and our shipping manager were conversing, talking about their favorite flowers. Well in the days leading up to Janice’s termination, Tara had brought flowers in for herself, Shea, and the shipping manager, but not for Janice. They were the flowers Janice brought up in their conversation, and here’s Tara bringing them in for everyone but her. Coincidence maybe, but shitty nonetheless.\n\nAbout a month or so after Janice was fired, Tara also left the winery. She had been offered a position at another winery that allowed her more freedom and felt it was an offer too great to refuse. Shea was promoted to Tara’s old position, and Shea’s position was left vacant.\n\nMeanwhile they had promoted Steve to Wine Educator. I still to this day do not know what he did in that position. He spent a majority of his time in the office answering emails. His Monday crew would complain to me about how at the beginning of every shift he would tell them to come get him if we had any walk-ins and he would handle them. That way the crew could focus on their reservations. And every time they would ask him to take the walk-ins he would ask the crew “Well do you all have the capacity to take them?” and try to weasel out of leaving the office.\n\nHe pulled the same move one saturday. He told us all at the morning team meeting that he would be the walk-in guy that day. Well the first walk-in group that came in he took. Then an hour later another group came in. I went to the front to greet them. When they asked if we had room for them I told them I would check with our walk-in guy. I approached Steve at his singular table, at which he had been talking for a half hour straight. “Steve, we have a walk-in group at the front. “Well, do we have the capacity to take them?” “I don’t know, Steve. You said YOU were the walk-in guy today. So do YOU have the capacity to take them?” His table we were in front of snickered. I felt slightly bad for having that conversation in front of customers, but that feeling quickly left me.\n\nA while later, outside of work I was stricken by incapacitating flank and lower back pain on my left side. That night I urinated blood. Kidney stones are the worst. My next shift at work I informed management I would have to pare down some of my responsibilities as bending and lifting too much with this stone would be insanely painful.\n\nNow up until this point I haven’t mentioned the true scope of my responsibilities at the winery. Yes, I am a server. But in addition to that I would inventory our food, every Friday I would drive into Portland to pick up that food (The winery is like an hour or so outside of the city), I would inventory our library wines (older vintage wines that we don’t display to the public, but are available for sale if some high rollers want to blow through their money) which included crawling up on top of large industrial wire rack shelves to count some of the wines, I would assign the days reservations to different servers sections, I tasted through all our opened wines every morning to ensure quality, we had a meat slicer that I used to slice the meat every thursday for our charcuterie boards, on the weekdays when we had no kitchen workers I would be the one who would make our charcuterie boards, I would process shipping orders, pack the shipping orders, and most important (according to the company) of all; every thursday we would get large pallets full of cases of wine from our warehouse brought to us to stock our store with so we had inventory to sell to customers. Every Thursday I would spend outside in the parking lot lifting 50 lbs boxes off of pallets (Some taller than me), throw them onto a dolly, shlep them uphill into our store and stock the store, then repeat ad infinitum. This was a 3-4 hour event some days. A day prior to the kidney stone announcing its presence I was outside moving cases for 5 hours in 100+ degree weather. I was covered in sweat, I was red in the face, I was exhausted. No matter how much water I drank between trips to grab the cases I couldn’t quench my thirst.\n\nThey relinquished most of my responsibilities to Kevin after I told them about the stone. He had started 4 months after me. I was the one who trained him. He’s a great guy. Truly, he became the first friend I made out here besides my roommates.\n\nI suffered with this kidney stone pain for 9 months. It honestly was never really debilitating per se. It would plateau at around a 6 on the pain scale for about 10 minutes or so. Enough to make me pause and lean on the counter of the tasting room bar for a bit, but not enough to put me in the fetal position in front of the toilet like the first one I had 5 years earlier.\n\nWhile I was dealing with this stone I tried to convince the company to give me health insurance. I worked there for around a year at that point. And I worked between 32-40 hours a week (During the winter I did 40 as we were slower and the tips weren’t as plentiful, and during the summer I lowered my hours to 32 to give myself more time to explore this new state and relax, and recuperate.) I researched and from what I could tell, in the state of Oregon, if you worked 32 or more hours at a small business you were considered full time. I approached our CFO.\n\n“Hey Ron, are we considered a small business?” “Technically yes we are, based on the number of employees we have full time here. Why, what’s up?” “Well I was researching last night, and the internet says if you work for 32 or more hours at a small business you’re considered a full time employee, and are therefore eligible for health insurance through the company.” Ron paused for a moment. “Well, technically, you aren’t considered a permanent employee. You are considered a seasonal employee. So unfortunately you don’t qualify for health insurance through us. You should look into OHP though.” “I have, I applied, but my application was denied. I think it might be because I’m not considered a resident of Oregon yet? But I’m not sure.” “Well try calling them instead of submitting an online application. It’s much easier to appeal to a human and get accepted when they can hear you rather than simply looking at a screen.” “...ok”\n\nLater, I told Shea about this interaction, and she told me she would look into it for me, because I deserved to be covered. I never heard about it again. I later learned that even though I was barely scraping by on the money I made, I made too much of it to qualify for OHP.\n\nWell a while after this happened I had a no-good-very-bad-day. My first group of customers for that day were… a lot. Every wine I brought out to them they told me was oxidized. I felt this untrue as we don’t allow opened bottles to stay in rotation for more than 2 days, and we taste through all opened bottles every morning to ensure quality. I was the one who tasted them that morning, and they were great. They asked me to open new bottles for them with every wine I brought out.\n\nThen I felt the twinge of kidney pain start to creep up. Then our kitchen worker asked me to cut the ends of the meat into strips for snacks. This was a thing I started doing, as there’s about a half inch of meat that the blade of the slicer just can’t reach every time you do it (Our kitchen worker is young, and wasn’t very comfortable with knives. I know, then why is she in the kitchen? Well we needed the help, and she does most everything else aside from that.) Well as I was cutting the meat ends into strips for us all I was briefly distracted by a conversation.\n\nNow, I know how to hold food that you’re cutting. I’ve worked in the food service industry since I was 15 (I hate that I have, but the fact is that I have). The ring finger of my non-dominant hand just happened to be holding the meat on its side, rather than on top of the meat, and I wasn’t paying attention. I cut the tip of my finger off. Not much. It was only a few layers of skin, but I tell ya what, the amount of blood that came out was wild. And boy did it hurt. I walked to the office, our closest first aid station, and began patching myself up. During the process of staunching the blood, and bandaging myself my group of shitty customers walked out citing the oxidized wine as unacceptable. Didn’t pay, just walked. Wine people can be… a lot sometimes. This was one of those two negative reviews that I mentioned earlier that were under my name as I served them, but weren’t about me. They said we should open fresh bottles every day which is insane and expensive. After all this I walked up to Shea and informed her that I was heading home. I was in kidney pain, I cut off the tip of my finger, and to top off the shit cake those customers were awful, and so I wanted to leave. She said ok, and I headed out.\n\nWell the next day after this incident I was called into Shea’s office. She sat me down and started the conversation off by telling me “So your coworkers weren’t really happy with how you left.” This upset me, and I told her as much. Weren’t happy with how I left? A bunch of shitty things happened to me back to back to back, INCLUDING cutting the tip of my finger off! WTF do you mean they weren’t happy with how I left? If the same had happened to them I’d be the first to tell them to head home. And looking back on it now I’m sure it wasn’t my coworkers, but rather she who didn’t like how I left. I talked to my gf at the time who was also a coworker and she said “We were all just kind of confused, because you were smiling as you were telling us you had to go because of the pain. We talked about how we were confused, but none of us seemed unhappy about it.” Like, yes I was smiling, but that doesn’t mean I wasn’t in immense pain. Smiling is better than getting mad and throwing shit or something. Would they have preferred that? The thing that really annoyed me about my and Shea’s conversation is how she started it. There was no “Hey, how are you feeling today? Is your finger alright?” It was just “Hey, you fucked up and you’re in trouble.”\n\nShe also mentioned that some of my coworkers were complaining about me. We had a server Mandy who was a very hard worker. I love her, she’s fantastic. But at the end of the day the rest of us would be sitting down, going over the events of the day, tasting some rare wines or something. And Mandy would still be facing the bottles on the end caps in the store around us. I would just make some jokes like “Mandy, you gotta stop working so hard you’re making us look bad!” and “Mandy, they pay you by the hour, not the project! Relax!” I had talked to Mandy about these exact comments I had been making. And she told me herself “You know sometimes it can be really annoying when you do that. But I do think I need those reminders sometimes because I do do too much.” After that conversation with her I slowed down on making those jokes, as I didn’t want to get on her nerves or anything. In the conversation with Shea she told me that some of my coworkers were complaining about me saying those jokes to Mandy. I knew exactly who it was that tattled. It was Steve. Weeks prior my gf had told me that Steve had brought up how much he hated it when I made those jokes. I found it ironic considering he did the least amount of work here.\n\nI began crying at this point. I’ve always been an emotional guy. I cry when I get too mad. I cry every time I watch that episode of Fresh Prince of Bel Air where Will’s dad comes back into his life only to leave again. I was just so frustrated that it all started to come out of me. She continued. “Your coworkers also feel like you haven’t been very supportive in the tasting room as of late. They feel as though they have to do everything while you just stand around. And you also don’t do any work while we’re having the Saturday morning team meetings.” I informed her that 1. Not supported? I have never once felt supported at this company. Nor appreciated. I used to work my fucking ass off before the whole kidney stone issues started - to which she agreed- and 2. I was in constant pain, and when you’re in constant pain somethings tend to slip your mind. IE doing more around the job. I still did everything in my job description, but my mind would be blank outside of those responsibilities (Every responsibility I mentioned earlier that I had previously done was not in my job description.) And not only both of those things, but when I DID work my ass off for this company, what did it get me? I was passed up for two promotions. So why would I work as hard as I did before? I was sort of dumping at this point as it had all been sort of bubbling to the surface slowly over time.\n\nShe retorted that not working as hard because I was passed up for opportunities was kind of a self fulfilling prophecy as if more opportunities arose that I wouldn’t be as high up the list now. I shot back “Honestly, after everything that’s happened or not happened to me at this company, I really don’t want a higher position any more.” And she brought up the tasting room lead position, and I told her that I recommended Kevin for the position as he had been doing a killer job lately (IE doing everything I used to do) and she agreed. Even threw in that he was who she was considering for the position anyway. As if to twist the knife even more. She also said “With how much pain you claim to be in, if you’re not healthy enough to do the work, then you should stay home.” Like… what? ‘Hey you don’t have insurance, and need money to survive, I know that this condition is constant and hard to deal with, but don’t come in if that’s the case.’\n\nAfter this conversation she said she needed to give me a hug after everything that was just said. It felt sort of scummy. I went into the bathroom after and cleaned my face off and waited for my eyes to stop being so wet.\n\nThey promoted Kevin the next week. I was happy for my boy, and again I didn’t blame him in any capacity for getting the position. There was always a twinge of discontent that someone I trained was now my boss, and that he’s 5ish years younger than me. I never let it affect how I interact with him, or treat him though. It’s just a small thing.\n\nThey also eventually promoted Steve from Wine Educator to Tasting Room Manager. So… the worst server we had is now our boss? Woof.\n\nI was able to sign up for govt. health care during open enrollment in Nov. of 2022.\n\nWell fast forward to January 2023 things have settled down a bit. At least in terms of the job, not so much my kidney. One day I came into work and spent the first half hour doing the duties I still had when suddenly a wave of pain and nausea washed over me. I ran to the bathroom and sat in there for 10 minutes. The pain eased slightly. I came back out to the tasting room and then made my way into the kitchen where everyone was in conversation. Another wave washed over me. I braced myself on the back of the oven. My hands were shaking from the pain and trying to keep myself upright. My eyes began to water. Shea noticed me staring off into space and asked if I was alright. I said no, in no uncertain terms was I alright. She said she could tell based on my hands shaking, and told me to head out.\n\nI waited in my car for a half hour for the pain to subside and when it did I drove home. That day I pissed basically straight blood the rest of the day. Unusual. I had been pissing blood on and off for these whole 7ish months. But when I would start to hydrate during the day the blood would dilute until it ran clear again. Well this particular day no matter how much water I drank the blood was still there. I waited until 6pm that night, and finally headed to the hospital. They gave me a CT scan and informed me that the reason I hadn’t passed the stone this whole time was because it was 11mm big. Imagine that! 1.1cm! Around half the size of a dime! Far too large to pass naturally. I would need surgery. Well at least I had insurance now, right?\n\nAnother month goes by, I met with the urologist and we scheduled my surgery for March 6th. I won’t go very in depth into this whole situation, but they couldn’t get the stone on the first surgery, so scheduled me for another one 10 days after. I couldn’t work this whole 10 days as the stent they had implanted to keep my kidney and bladder connected was SO UNCOMFORTABLE that I could always feel it. Any time I moved I could feel it rattling around inside me. It hurt, it was the most uncomfortable experience of my life. I had just gotten my tax refund back the week before and I had to use it all just to survive paying rent, car payment, food and copays for all of these doctor visits and surgeries. I emailed our CFO and informed him I would be using all 40 hours of my paid sick time this week to make up for the loss of work.\n\nWell after the whole debacle was over I was finally free and felt so much better. You never realize how chronic-ish pain not only affects your physical health, but your mental health as well. Even when you’re not in pain, you’re waiting for it to happen again. I have clinical depression, and anxiety. This whole 9 month issue sent me into a depression spiral. It got pretty dark at times. My gf broke up with me in the middle of all of this as well.\n\nWe had hired this new girl a few months prior, Chelsea. She worked for another winery as well, but needed a second job as she wasn’t getting the hours she wanted at that winery. Later I found out that she was being let go from that winery, and was transitioning to become another full timer with us. While I was off for 10 days recovering from the surgeries they cut my hours and gave them to Chelsea. It was only one shift. I would have eventually wanted to move from 40 back to 32 as the busy season was in a few months, but they didn’t even ask. The first time that had happened actually. For all the shit I talk about this company, they do a good job of working with their employees for their schedules. But this time they just came up and told me that they removed me from Tuesdays. They didn’t have many hours right now to go around for everyone.\n\nFor the next two months; three days before each paycheck I had to hope and pray that I had enough food to last me until my next payday. My bank account was constantly at $0 during those days. Then I was given the bill for my surgeries. All told the total was like $50k+, after my insurance I still owed \\~$7k. An amount I was still unable to pay. I started the process of applying for financial aid from the hospital. (A few weeks ago I was approved for 100% forgiveness, I’d never been so happy)\n\nAbout a month or so ago I went wine tasting with Steve. The management for the front of house team has this thing they do where every few weeks they take one of us servers to a few wineries around the Willamette to see how other places were doing it, and so we had recommendations for when our customers asked. Steve took me to two on a Friday. At the first winery he spent the whole time telling me about the backstory of the family that started that winery. It was interesting. As we went to leave that winery he told me that he wanted to hear from me at the next winery. Wanted to know how I was doing, and life, and about me.\n\nWe got to the next winery and he started off by asking how things were. “Things are a little rough right now, man. After my surgeries I’ve had to hope I have enough food for the three days leading up to each paycheck. It’s hard.” He goes “Ok, so that’s recently… how are you finding Oregon overall?” …I told him fine, and that I liked Oregon for the most part. Then the conversation turned to work. He told me he thought it was a little messed up that the company had passed me up for so many promotions (Keep this in mind for later, there’ll be a call back.) I agreed with him. Said I felt like the management of this company just didn’t really like me. Which is fine, I’m an adult. I don’t need everyone to like me. But it still made me sad. Like, a couple months after he started they gave him a key. I’ve been here for 2 years and I don’t have shit. Then told him that at this point I don’t really care about climbing the ladder. It had been made clear I wasn’t liked, and that I wouldn’t be getting any sort of promotion so I had been looking for a new job for about a year at that point. He contemplated that for a while.\n\nThen he started talking about how the owner of the company liked people with clear goals. Kevin has a clear goal to get sponsored by the company to travel and work abroad for a season or two (Which the company agreed to do I guess?), and Chelsea has clear goals (I don’t remember what he said her goals were tbh.), and that it seemed like I didn’t have very clear goals. I told him about how many times I had brought up to Tara that I had experience being management in a winery, and that I used to work super hard for this company. I used to have goals when I started at this company, and look where it got me! He thought about this some more. And then also told me that the comment he gets a lot from people about me is that it seems like I just don’t want to be there (which… fair I guess. I don’t.) Sorry for unmasking around coworkers when I have to be “on” constantly in front of customers I guess?\n\nMy ex started as a server like me, but they moved her into the office to coordinate sales for our distributors. 6 months after she landed that position she was outside of her boss’ (Ron, the CFO’s) office and heard him talking to one of the company's national sales team on the phone about how my ex wasn’t working out and that he was going to post her position online soon.\n\nShe was shocked. She knew she wasn’t doing great at the job, but she also had very little training, and very little support. Not only did she have a lot on her plate with her own job, but any time customers called the winery to make a reservation she was the one who had to pick up the phone. Apparently the team that manages the tasting room can’t be bothered to answer the phone for reservations for the tasting room. Well eventually her and her boss had the talk and she informed him she had heard him talking about it on the phone. He profusely apologized and told her that they would consider the whole thing a lay off so she could still get unemployment if she wanted, and that she could stay until they find someone to replace her so she has some time to find a new job. While we were no longer together, we still worked together and talked all the time. She kept me updated on the whole scenario.\n\n(I reached the text limit, and will finish the rest in the comments)",

    "text": "Im a delivery driver for a small business and it sucks  \n\nI (24, male) work for a dental lab. Basically, when you go to your dentist and need a crown, partial, implants or dentures, they order from us. \n\nIt's a small business, and the boss has no idea how to manage money. He owns three different cars, one for business meetings, a nice Mercedes that's kept in storage most of the time.( which I don't have a problem with because you need a nice car to show that your legit, I guess) but he also has a Cadillac SUV, and a Tacoma. Idk what his wife drives. \n\nAnyways, it just looks bad when he has to pull up at gas stations to hand me a different credit card for the gas. That's why I'm mentioning it. Like the card declines half the time. I've had to buy some gas here and there because if there's no money on the card and no cash in the business purse, then I'm fucked. Can't work. Plain and simple. Oh and dentists can't get their cases for their patients. So if your dentures are taking forever to get to you, I'm sorry, it's not entirely my fault. \n\nI work for California minimum wage, $15/hr. I have no benefits. No sick time. No 401k. No insurance. Nothing else. Just pay. \n\nI have a company car provided, and expense wise they take care of it, like oil changes and shit. But they have no idea, like no clue about car repair or even maintenance. \n\nI was driving a 2010 Kia soul, with 285,000 miles. Cracked windshield, fucked alignment that drives to the left. \n\nBefore it was stolen, the brake pads were grinded down to nothing. The transmission was failing. One headlight was out. One taillight was out. The key snapped off a while ago, and it was just glued back on pretty much. \n\nIt was sketchy to drive, and I was getting scared. (No I did not steal the car ok, I know what your thinking) \n\nSo I'm glad it's gone. But, when I did have it, it was so hard getting parts and getting any sort of permission to take care of it. \n\nWhen it was stolen, I couldn't work, because they refused to rent a car daily. I couldn't work for a full week and was looking at other jobs. \n\nI didn't want to use my own car, because it's  new (under 50k miles new, which is as new as someone my age can get) and if I wrecked it, I would owe like $20k while finding a new car. (never been in an accident btw) and the mileage is killer. Years of use in a month basically because I'm driving over 100 miles a day. And they aren't going to reimburse me for the mileage. \n\nI am lucky enough to get paid at all. Is basically what my supervisor told me. So, yeah I'm trying to have this job be as temporary as possible. \n\nBut to get to the real point for the post; it sucks. \n\nIm given  routes by someone who doesn't know where everything is. They don't know how long it takes to get from one place to another. They never calculate traffic. They expect me to drive fast, which I'm not going to do, I will not risk life and limb for this bullshit. Im a California driver, so I'm already driving fast enough. \n\nThe doctors talk and complain to me, like I know what dental problems they are having. I'm a driver, not a fucking technician. And they never have the cases ready to go at a moments notice. Alot of them have two hour lunches and they complain that we never come by. They keep reminding me their lunch hours, like our schedules can easily accommodate theirs. Like bro I don't have lunch till I'm done. Hell most of the time I'm eating while I drive. \n\nI can't shit, because there's literally no time for it. Recently, I've had like a whole page of destinations for my morning route, ( this particular day, it was a 3 hour route, but they kept telling me it should have been less than 2 hours, and then they keep adding places when I'm on the road, like wtf). It took me all day that time. They were on my ass, asking me why it took so long. \n\nI didn't have the words, tried going through the route with them about it, but they insisted I was fucking around. I'm just over it with them, looking for work somewhere else.\n\nThe doctors are horrible, they complain all the time. Their staff always try to leave early, and lie about me not being in time for deliveries and pick ups. \n\nBut the worst thing is that no one believes Im working in good faith. Both the doctors and my own co workers think I'm some fuck who doesn't want to work. My only friend is an older Mexican man, who knows what's up, and told me before everyone there are fucking idiots. He owns his own business, this is a side gig for himself. \n\nBut oh my god, people are so incompetent and I'm suffering because some fuck doesn't want to run his business like a business. \n\nI'm not the only one who suffers. A Japanese man living in Texas is a remote worker, a tooth designer working for us part time. He hasn't been paid this entire month. \n\nThe boss is in Vegas, and people have not been paid. I also heard this is more of a hobby for him, because his wife is rich. So basically he's a beta male cuck who has people depend on him but he just likes to pretend he's a business owner. That's it, that's my boss. \n\nBefore this I was working for a overnight courier franchise, at a warehouse. I worked long hours, graveyard. It was horrible, it gave me insomnia. But, at least they gave me sick hours, health insurance, and let me work overtime. They wrote me up for attending my grandmother's funeral, and withheld a check from me, but idk it was better than getting fucked by some people who have no concept of business. \n\nThe warehouse job also had pizza night on Friday so I mean that was cool. \n\nBut fuck small businesses man. At least the ones run by an idiot.",

    "text": "How do you long-term recover from a botched FBI investigation that ruined your career and your reputation? I’m 57 y.o. male, empty nester living in a fairly typical American metro area. My wife and I currently make right at $200K a year, with my salary around $130K and my wife's at 70K. We have two grown daughters and two grandkids, each of our daughters married with one child. I am the oldest of four siblings, one of of whom live nearby. I have an earned doctorate in a field I no longer am involved with.\n\nTen years ago, I was forcefully removed from my dream career by a botched multi-year FBI investigation that was widely publicized and ruined my name in my industry. At the time it occurred, I was on a rocket ship upward, making $220K a year, about to be able to name my own price and become a true leader in my small, but active field. As a result of the investigation (which played out in the media) I was fired and also headed to prison before the authorities realized it wasn’t correct and quit it with me, dropping all charges. But the reputational damage was done (Google is not my friend) and I had to completely start over. My wife and I lost our savings through the process and went into deep debt, borrowing a bunch of money from family to pay attorneys fees and to relocate. It's now been ten years and although, between the two of us, we've made up 80% to 90% of the annual income we used to make, we still have very little in savings. Our debt load is still right around $100K in federal student loans (about $150K in consumer debt and lawyer's fees paid off) and we are long-term renters, having completely missed the real estate boom during Covid due to lack of funds for a down payment. Ironically, I will get a somewhat solid pension from my former life, but it doesn't kick in for another three years and we already realize all we'll be able to do with it is keep working, continue to pay down debt and save, save, save for multiple years after that.\n\nAfter bumbling and stumbling through the first couple of years after the immediate crisis passed (relocating to a different region, getting help from my extended family), I had dropped so far down the ladder that I was doing door-to-door sales. I had applied for 500+ jobs, to no avail (see above about google). Finally, a good guy I'd met offered me a junior sales position at his small pest control company, which had me doing cold calls and door-to-door sales. I got lucky one day and knocked on the door of a man who was an executive for a light manufacturing company (eight factories across US) and he was looking for a corporate purchaser/buyer. It was a private company - no board to impress, and - after getting to know me - he was able to convince the owner to hire me. I was grateful for the position, even though the person I replaced didn't even have an associate's degree and the pay was $65,000 a year. I was just thrilled to find a \"spot.\" I was determined to make it work. \n\nI've now been with that company seven years and have been able to show my boss (now the CEO) and the owner that I have a lot to offer. My salary has doubled and they've given me wider responsibility over the years (I am now in charge of much of the HR function for the company - the hiring and onboarding, along with the purchasing). The problem is, bluntly speaking, I find little value in my job and don't enjoy it. It's a terrible fit for me - the only reason I do well in it is because it's extremely easy. I'm a people person but all I do most days is answer email and fill out purchase orders. I do enjoy the HR function, but it's probably only 20% of my position. 80% is doing a job that - if they posted it on Indeed - would require only a HS diploma. I don't enjoy going to work, and liken it to getting grounded to my room to do homework all day, every day. I literally go into my office, shut my door and do paperwork until it's time to go home. I used to have a staff of hundreds of folks, now zero people report to me and I do paperwork all day. I know it sounds like whining, but the reality of it for me is quite difficult.\n\nBut, as they now pay me a solid salary and, as I have no significant savings and a ton of debt, I just keep getting up and going to work. And this has been going on for YEARS. I’m 57 now and have basically sleep-walked through my professional life the past seven years - ever since I turned 50. All of my younger siblings (I'm the oldest of four) have now zoomed past me financially and professionally and just shake their head about my sleep-walking - \"get your shit together, bro\" is a line I hear fairly regularly.  I’d love to quit and do a “third” career, but very gun shy and probably suffering a lot of PTSD (and depression) regarding professional risk.\n\n\nI feel I have so much more to offer. I don't want to continue sleep walking. I want to WAKE UP and get into a professional endeavor that I enjoy, contributes to the community and pays well - I want to utilize my skills the way I'd spent 25 years preparing and then accomplishing. I know a big piece of the advice coming is \"life sucks, just keep going\" and also \"well, if it's that bad, quit everything and trust yourself to try starting over again.\" I guess what I am looking for is something in the middle (aren't we all?)  **I’d love some advice.** Thanks.",

    "text": "I feel like all of my current and former peers are passing me by at 100mph and I’m stuck spinning my tires in situations I hate with no way of changing them. How do I turn it around? \nTl;dr I need to escape a dead end job and subpar educational background and actually become something but I feel like even though I have the drive to change it, I don’t know where to start, don’t know if I have the resources to do so at all. \n\nKind of a rant. Idk. \n\nI graduated from college a year and two months ago with a degree in history and English. Since then I have held two jobs: I managed a coffee shop, which was fun but unsustainable, and I worked at a hotel which is my current job. Well paying, but not enjoyable tbh. \n\nMy grades weren’t amazing when I graduated because I had been struggling with pretty substantial major depression and suicidal ideation for the second half of college that happened during Covid. Still, “c’s get degrees” and all that so I powered through. History and English are really my main two interests aside from more niche subtopics like anthropology, studies of myth & religion, archaeology, etc. but I just knew that I didn’t want to do something that wouldn’t play to a passion of mine. I want to love my work even if it means sacrificing financial stability now. \n\nI now have neither. \n\nI regret my degrees and wish, as someone who didn’t aim for the focus of being a teacher or some shit that I had specialized my focus to anthropology or archaeology more closely but I’m insanely broke and can’t even fathom going back to school to pick up the pieces and get another degree, even fast-tracked or online (I also just don’t think it would look good). I also told myself I wasn’t interested in grad school in the past and that I would worry about it in the future if I wanted but I needed a break. That was a mistake. The opportunity for some sort of internship came and went forever. I never corresponded closely enough with professors to get a leg up in that regard. And again, I got so-so grades for useless degrees and I have not been proven to have had any more worth than someone who just straight up didn’t go to college. I wasted four years for a lifetime of shame and regret and crippling debt. My current partner also says that I can’t go to grad school unless I can get funding because it would leave us too deep in debt so it’s seemingly off the table, but tot doesn’t even look like people in my field are making decent splashes with their careers anyways unless they have doctorates which like, as if. \n\nMeanwhile, my two close friends got degrees in business and communications and are working comfortable high-paying jobs. They’re both 23 and just bought their first house. My older sister just moved to Chicago for grad school after an absolutely incredible i story of internships, opportunities, and points of excellence as a student and my younger sister had an internship with a law firm as an undergrad with law school aspirations. Even my friend who dropped out of college and is a full-blown alcoholic is working an extremely successful career as a mechanic. And I’m here, working in hospitality for barely enough money to scrape by with a partner who isn’t doing much better in a role that I probably only needed a GED to get in a city I didn’t really want to live in. I feel like a failure. \n\nEveryone says I’m smart. Everyone has said I’m smart my whole life. I don’t feel smart. I feel inept at everything I do. I struggled through high school. I struggled in college. I like the things that I mentioned. I live for books and literature and sagas of history and the world of man, and want to spend a lifetime studying humanity and sharing my findings with humanity. I wanted to be a professor but I can wave that goodbye without good grades, grad school, or any real achievements to stand on. I’m even writing a book, as author is another big achievement that I would love to reach, but I’m 30,000 words/100 pages deep into writing it and just feel defeated. I doubt myself at every turn and I feel like finishing a story that people will care about as much as I do and actually conquering the task of traditional publication is such a Herculean task that it feels impossible. I write regardless, but it doesn’t hold the same luster. I can’t even get a job working the door of a museum with how bad the job market is rn, and neither can people I know that DO have master’s degrees. \n\nI even decided at one point that I would be content with working in a coffee shop my whole life. Why not? It was fun. I was good at it. I made people happy and worked in an environment that didn’t make me wish I was dead. Making flat whites doesn’t keep food on the table though. I even got a job offer from a coffee shop that I would consider dream job territory and when I asked if their wage of $11/hr was negotiable as I couldn’t survive off of that, they cut contact with me. \n\nI moved to a different city because I thought that that would change things. Cities are where opportunities are, right? It’s no different. \n\nI’m 22 years old. 23 in a month. I feel like every action I’ve taken in my life thus far has been failure after failure leading me to the failure that I am now, and I’m just stuck job hopping in industries that I hate forever until I get my big break too late for me to be able to smother out the regret of lost opportunities with money or I die.\n\nI don’t sleep anymore. I eat enough to stay mostly alive. I stopped going to the gym, which was my one great non-intellectual hobby that brought me joy. I just want to succeed. I just want to be given the chance that will let me live a life that makes me happy in the moment and satisfied with my work and what I achieved when I get to the end. What am I working towards? What the fuck do I even want to achieve? \n\nI need to know that I’m not the only one here…more importantly I need to know that others have been here and broken free. I need to know that someone can make all of this worth it and BE something. To achieve or contribute to something. To be great in small ways that can, if no one else, make me proud. Make me feel less small. Make me feel like I’m not the floundering black sheep of a family that has always been able to just “make it work” so fucking effortlessly. \n\nI’m sorry for being so melodramatic. I just wish it would all stop sometimes.",

    "text": "How do I break out of this box and are vanity titles bad? Breaking out of the box and vanity titles\n\nSorry if this is long and rambling, I’ll try to strike that balance between brevity and enough detail.\n\nFor my entire career I’ve been a very competent, efficient, and valued “doer.” I work in the creative field and currently serve as “director of creative services” at a state college. Unfortunately, it’s really just a vanity title they gave me to keep me from leaving. I don’t really get the responsibilities or respect that should go with that title. I’m still just seen as “the guy that can use photoshop” or “the guy with the camera” that gets brought in at the last minute. I like the college, the people, and working in higher ed. But I’ve also been working hard to break out of the box I’m in and be seen as someone that can do more, that can lead. To do so, I recently obtained my Ed.D. degree. I’m glad the degree was mostly free (benefit of working at the college) because now I have this relatively generic doctorate degree but all my experience is in creative and not really in what my doctorate is in (instructional systems and learning technology). After about ten years at this college, I’ve now gotten to the point where I feel like it’s time to finally leave. \n\nUnfortunately, I’m not having much luck. I’ve had a few interviews but nothing more. My theory is that the jobs I’m going for that relate to my degree aren’t picking me due to my lack of direct educational experience. While higher up jobs in creative (ie. real creative director or marketing director style jobs) aren’t picking me because my degree is unrelated or a turn off to them. I know I’m not talented enough to be a creative director at a major firm or university, and I feel like I’m going for jobs that are actually within my means and ability. The best luck I’ve had so far is an interview at a small hospital for Director of Marketing and Communications. I felt like the interview went well and they really liked me. Unfortunately, I get the feeling the job is still a vanity title where I’ll still be the one-man-band “guy that uses photoshop.”\n\nSo my questions are: how do I break out of this box I’m in? And, if this one job actually offers it to me, should I just shut up and take the vanity title even though it’s more of the same?\n\nThanks in advance for any input and/or advice.",

    "text": "What is a career I am not considering that requires no further education? 43F who is autistic with ADHD, Alberta Canada. I tried to give comprehensive background but summarized most info in category TLDRs.\n\nIntro: \nI aced University but I generally suck at real life. I am lost trying to think of a job that will allow me to live without eventual burnout from masking as an autistic.  I need something that gives me flexibility for my waxing and waning energy and requires very little hustling in person or on the phone. Email is fine because communicate much more effectively in writing than verbally. I would consider related self employment ideas too.\n\nIdeal job characteristics: \nFocus on creativity,  problem solving in Science & Arts. Importance placed on ideation and planning for implementation, and then delegate to others to actually finish. Maybe project based? No cold calling or selling and prefer remote or hybrid work. Ideas which help others is very appealing.  \n\nStruggles with typical employment: TLDR: mostly Communication / Sensory\n\n- Just getting employment. I am terrible at interviews. \n- work at 200% 3 days a week and 10% the last 2 days when I am recovering. \n- Asking too many questions and wanting to know more about stuff outside of my job description. \n- Meetings leave me confused and unclear about priorities and what was brainstorming vs actionable ideas.\n- Treating everyone as my peer to have intelligent conversations and brainstorming with regardless if speaking with a 7 year old or my CEO. \n- Subjective language and unclear expectations/ directions\n- Feeling like an outsider- the loneliness of not really wanting to do outside of work social activities but also feeling hurt when everyone is closer or they stop bothering to invite you. \n- Oversharing\n- Environment: I need a quiet minimally stimulating area with few human interactions. \n- I tend to have SO MUCH STUFF because I hate not having what I need in the moment. This means I am messy in the wrong environment. \n\nWhat I enjoy: TLDR: mostly creating and finding solutions. \n\n- Thinking about the “big ideas and issues” such as  climate crisis, consciousness, cognitive development, sources and solutions for inequality, longtermism, ethics, modelling human development of cognition to facilitate research. \n- Learning!!!! I am a slow processor at times especially if requires visualization to understand the lecture but once it clicks I am on my way. \n- Visually designing something\n- Creating systems/ organizing ideas for others \n- Editing photos (but just the editing part- I know little about the actual in-person taking photos) \n- Communicating about science \n- Graphic Design in Canva / Easy (little coding) web design in drag/drop programs like wix\n- Writing\n- designing and building things BUT I never like building or creating the same major idea twice. \n- Hobbies : Video Microscopy, drawing, water colour portraits,\n- \nWhat I am good at: \nTLDR: skills: Researching, Ideation, problem-solving, areas: Psychology, Cognitive Science, Medicine , Education, visual Arts. \n\n- Researching, tracking down info- I swear my persistence means I can find anything. I am so happy and hyperfocused when working on a problem/ question. \n- Learning new skills \n- Prompt generation, I just seem to be able to keep shaping a prompt until I get what I need. I do think that Prompt engineering as a career will soon be obsolete as technology makes the middle man no longer needed.  \n- Mentoring, I am very good at researching and offering resources and solutions. As an older student (43) I had many younger classmates come for advice which always surprises me. \n- Finding the best deals on things (I guess this fits into researching) \n- Aesthetics and styling. I have always had a good sense of what is visually pleasing. \n- Finding creative ways to educate that uses project and experiential learning to help people remember and apply their knowledge\n- Writing: I love to write both academically and to write personal but informative papers to help break down the gate keeping of knowledge. We all deserve the opportunity to have complex ideas broken down into meaningful communication. \n- Providing strategies for interacting with ND kiddos\n- Weird and  not a job possibility but medical/ psych diagnosing. Don’t worry I do not go around giving people diagnoses I just have the background and I see patterns in symptoms . I don’t always have the greatest memory but I remember everything medical. 🤷‍♀️\n- Developing Teaching materials and lessons. (I wish I could just do this and not do the teaching 😉) \n\n\nEducation:\nTLDR: certificate: family engagement in medical research diplomas: Nursing, audio engineering Degrees: BSc, BEd\n\n\n-Audio Engineering post-production diploma (obsolete now, but the foundations like layering and signal flow  have helped me a lot with editing music, video, photos, and graphic design) \n\n-Practical Nursing Diploma (license now lapsed) taught me how much I love science and medicine. Worked as a pediatric nurse but hated that curiosity and thirst for knowledge  was frowned upon (aka: “why does the rationale for the order matter? Just do it.”)\n\n- BSc Life Science with a focus on Physiology, Pharmacology, Biology, Neuroscience. This was supposed to be my pre-med once I realized I wanted to be a pathologist not nurse but my family responsibilities made it obvious towards the end that med school + residency was not a possibility \n\nBEd focus Science. My BSc was useless as I had planned it as a stepping stone to med school. My Uni offered a 2 year after degree bachelor of Education program. I thought I could work as a science teacher but despite graduating with a 4.0 I realized the level of masking required to teach K-12 would break me down in less than a year. Love teaching small groups and adults. Also was hired as a research assistant and received funding to do my own educational research which I LOVE. \n\nIf I could I would love to be in grad school doing research into developing a methodology to analyze and model curriculum to develop longtermism thinking in k-12 school but that is not a possibility because I cannot get an application together, my husband isn’t keen after 6 years studying to have 5+ more for my doctorate and I need to make some kind of financial contribution to our family.",

    "text": "What are the future job prospects for my fields of interest, and what should I focus my self-study on throughout the remainder high school? I have always had immenese interest in medicine, and perhaps more specifically neurology. I a year ago went ahead and self studied a bunch of the brain's anatomy, from action potentials, to areas of the brain, to different neurological disease even going as niche as Korsakoff syndrome (which I recalled because of the later mentioned book1). Despite all this, I no longer have any interest in pursuing the field of medicine. I am currently an 11th grader, and I haven't touched such topics in over a year. The reason I have no interest in becoming a doctor of any kind, is the amount of time it takes, the money, and the terrible work conditions. It would be much easier for someone like me, who also has great interest in physics ,computer science, and programming, more specifically machine learning (I have self studied some linear algebra, as well as calcalus and probablity, and combined them with andrew ng courses, back in March, and have been busy with irl, mostly social related stuff since, so no further progress has been made, that is until I decide what direction I want to pursue from here on out. \\[Yes the amount of things I self studied might be impressive for my age, but up until that March it came with the cost of a social life. \\]), to pursue a career in the programming field, which offers great work to life balance (comparatively with the exhausing hours of being a resident, or a practitioner \\[though I am from Israel and my knowledge is based on sources from mainly the U.S. , I have been hearing similar horror stories here\\]), with good pay, and recruitment based mostly on skill, even if gained through self study and not official institutions such as college and university (which up until this point of my life always felt a bit slow, and boring.). Yet, there's a lingering emotion in me, about neurology, and it today got stronger as I picked up \"The man who mistook his wife for a hat1\", my first English book in a while (I spent the last year learning Japanese, and in that endeavour dedicated my free time to immersing in Japanese books, so I was very excited when I decided to pick back up EN reading, especially on a topic I haven't touched upon in a while). What should I do? Ideally i'd like to pursue a career that integrates my interest in medicine and computer science, but I am honestly lost, especially since army service is mandatory and a minimum of 3 years, and will come right after I finish High-school.  \n\n\nHuge thanks to all answerers!",

I'm not saying homeschooling is bad, but in my case it made my parents leave me basically to myself and although I have a high school level education, I don't even have a GED. I desperately need a radical transformation for my job. I'm willing to put in tons of hours and break my back and take training, but I have a wife and kid to feed and house at the same time. Ive considered getting a cdl, but that costs $3500 for training and I really don't want to leave my family for weeks at a time or sell myself to a company for two years to get free training. I am willing to though, if that's what it takes. Im hoping someone could drop an idea that will fit my situation. Again, if I could work 11 hour days just to make alot, I'd be willing to do that. I'm not good in the sun. I get heat stroke easily. I'm fairly smart and I think I could have become a doctor or something if my parents had encouraged me to get educated. I'm 31 now. Please go easy on the criticism. I was given a very bad start on life. What can I do to transform how much I make, at any cost? Currently doing door dash and a job at mcdonald's would be an upgrade.

Sorry this is long bit figure the more info the better chance of getting a helpful response.\n\nI need advice. I'm 32 and can't get out of basic entry level customer service. I started at 16 working retail. I went to university and got a bachelor's degree in criminology and psychology. Not long after graduating I started working at a major printer company on their phone support. I worked there for 3 years and said how I wanted to move up and out of customer service but they wouldn't help me develop and I never got anywhere near moving up.\n\nI left there for a small helpdesk company. I worked there for 2 years as the phone guy. Basically a one man call center. Expressed again how I wanted to move up but nothing. It was made pretty clear I would never be anything but that. \n\nNow been working at a large insurance company for 2 years. Same thing. Told them I want to move out of customer service. Not even picky what. But my last boss wouldn't give me any guidance at all on what to do. I have a new boss now as my old one got promoted. He's been like co manager of the team for a bit before fully taking over. He talks a lot about wanting to develop people. He seems like a nice guy. We had a one on one meeting and I told him the same thing, that I want to move up and out of being the call centre guy. I also told him no manager has ever tried to develop me. Honestly I have no idea what that even looks like. \n\nHe kept saying about staying where I am and just being good at that. I told him I want to know how to get out of that but he just nicely kept avoiding it.\n\nFor disclosure I have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and a bad anxiety disorder. My doctor and therapist have me working fully remote while the company is hybrid. I don't connect easy with other people. I never made a single friend in university. I have no idea what networking or development really are. From what I gather networking is like making friends or something and development is supposed to be like your boss telling you like hey here's how to get to where you want to go?\n\nSo right now I'm in the same spot I've been in my whole life. Every job has been something someone off the street with no experience can get. I can't go back to school. I have a family and can't afford it. \n\nBe honest, is there a way out and if so how? It just wears me down every day. Or should I just accept my limitations.\n\nThanks",

    "text": "Looking for advice on a new career path? So, I’m at a point in my career where I’m looking for a change. I’ve been at my current company for approximately 5 years now. It was my first job out of college, but I feel like I’ve done all I want to do here and moving any further upward in the company feels like I would be moving into a space that doesn’t align with my interests and goals.\n\nFor some background, I work as a researcher/data analyst at an agency for pharmaceutical clients. My primary roles are to: \n\n1) analyze social conversation of patients or doctors to derive insights for clients on how to approach an audience regarding their treatment. This mostly entails a lot of reading, as well as using some analytics tools to cut the data in ways that brings insights to the surface. \n2) analyze search metrics to best understand the audience’s search behavior, which can provide insights into an audience’s understanding of a particular disease state, as well as what their thought processes are when they search online. Then, I can provide SEO/SEM recommendations.\n3) analyze an audience’s demographics, interests, as well as brand and media affinities in order to provide insight into “what kind of person” this audience is and what is the best way to target them.\n\nIn addition to this, I have a secondary role as a tech enablement and automation liaison. In this role, I am responsible for being the point person who helps the analytics department understand how to best leverage technology. I do this by being the middle man between analytics and data science/engineering. We have proprietary tools stored in Databricks and I have also been learning SQL on the fly to help develop queries that can aid in accessing certain information from our internal databases.\n\nReasons I want to move on: \n- I am somewhat tired of doing analytics for pharma clients. If I am going to continue to spend time deriving insights within the healthcare space I would like it to be in an effort to make meaningful change. If I am going to continue to do that kind of work, I would like it to benefit the general public rather than just a corporation’s market share.\n- The further I move up the company, the more the focus shifts from hands-on work to organizational aspects and selling projects. I’m not much of a salesman, and I do enjoy working with my “hands.”\n\nMy Interests:\n- I would like a greater focus on mental health and even drug addiction. Those areas feel more interesting and rewarding to me, and those projects can be few and far between in my current line of work. And when they come it’s not like the insights go out to those who could really use it.\n- I enjoy being creative. In my free time I love to write and to draw and my dream would be to turn that into a career by writing and illustrating my own comic books. However that is a long term goal and I know I still need a steady job in the meantime. \n\nMy College Background:\n- I went to school school for communications and digital media, with minors in advertising and creative writing. \n- I learned a variety of interesting creative skills including digital art, blogging, video editing, and web design (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). \n- I interned at a non-profit where I was responsible for maintaining a social media presence, blogging, doing some video work, as well as community outreach\n- I also briefly spent time as the lead video editor for a startup TV series. \n\nMy video skills are probably not as sharp as they were, because it’s been some time since I’ve put them to use, but my analogue skills (writing/drawing) are still as sharp as ever, as I still utilize them in my spare time almost daily. \n\nHow did I get here?\n- Getting a job out of college was a scary prospect and I was dealing with a lot of imposter syndrome at the time. So, I settled for a job more tangentially related to my skills with the help of a friend to reference me. \n- I am genuinely good at my current job and find that I pretty easily can pick up a variety of skills.\n\nSo, now I’m feeling a little lost and a little stuck. I feel like I have a lot of good skills, but I can’t seem to put the puzzle pieces together.",

    "text": "Just casually thinking about the time my doctors almost let my appendix rupture during my pregnancy. Black women get the worse care. Hmm.  Going down memory lane today.  Very traumatizing experience. I have endometriosis and the doctors knew. For months while I was pregnant I was having this random, severe right flank pains.  It was horrible. I would be absolutely disabled and unable to breathe. To the ER I would go and they would run the same tests over and over again then pump me full of morphine and send me home. At some point I was afraid to go back to the dr because I felt like they assumed I was drug seeking.  It finally hit a head at 9 months when the pain was so bad I was projectile vomiting. I went to the ER and told the dr about my pain. She didn't even touch me. Immediately dismissed me as having sciatica, sent me home with tylenol and left the room.  I went home and cried all night, I even popped a vicodin and it didn't touch the pain.  I called the dr line and she yelled at me over the phone. I eventually went back to L&D where they made me wait overnight in pain for a doctor even though they had doctors on the floor.  I cried all night and all but one nurse was so rude to me.  My temperature was rising, my baby was in distress and I was starting to dilate. I rolled around in pain, a nurse came in and yelled at me for moving the band, she slammed my hand down to my side when I reached up to touch my belly.   Finally in the early am the doctor comes in saying it's appendicitis and they need to do a caesarian and appendectomy. I was terrified.  Turns out I had a rare condition called decidualized endometriosis.\n\nMy baby was ok. When I finally came to, the same doctor that dismissed me tried to come in and check on me. I just stared at her and she backed out of the room.  They all downplayed what really went on. They knew they fucked up but I was too wounded to fight back. I just wanted my baby. \n\nI believe my abuse came from me being in a relationship with an older white man.  What should have been a joyous birth is marred by the abuse at the hands of the ones that are supposed to heal and nurture. Even the lactation nurses were not kind. \n\nI have an appointment next week to talk to a doctor on that performed my hysto two years later. I asked for pictures and more detailed and got none. I have so many questions and got no answers, no apologies. I feel stronger and more confident now. \n\nI guess this a vent post honestly. I did eventually report the way I was treated but it was just a we'll do training type message and that was it. \n\nMoving to Kentucky was the worse mistake I could have made.

    "text": "People can be terrible TW: Narcissism and abusive people\n\nPart 1:\nI have an older biological male sibling (a.k.a XY) that is a pedophile (keep this in mind it will make sense later). He is a grown man that is now in his thirties. He lived with my dad all the way until he was 29. He never contributed anything to the household, he was not enrolled in college, he told random women online that he was a doctor and said he delivered babies and coaxed these women to come over to my dad’s house so he could screw them there (he told them it was his house) << my dad knows about this by the way, XY is a highschool dropout, and he has a streak for abusing many people including his baby mama’s. I don’t claim him as my brother because he is EVIL. Anyways a day or two ago my dad and I argued as usual because he does not like communicating like a normal person. He basically admitted to granting XY grace and not me and my other older sisters. And in that same breath he told me I better go sell my body or find a way to make a living somehow. He said this because he likes to gaslight or demean me whenever I say something factual. This conversation was toxic and draining I can’t even remember why it happened. But I remember asking him why he would even propose an idea like to me when I am actively pursuing my degree in college. Then I brought up how he let XY LIVE WITH UNTIL HE WAS DAMN NEAR THIRTY (I DON’T PLAN ON DOING THIS I JUST BROUGHT IT UP TO HEAR WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT THAT). I also mentioned how XY never did anything besides spread his seed and do nothing but abuse people while he was freeloading. My dad got angry at me and kept drowning me out by saying XY is still his son and I love him. I just find this crazy and sick. Another thing my own father had said was that the main victim of XY’s abuse had consensual sex with him mind you he told me her abuse started when she was 7……….\nI can’t wait for the summer so I can work like a damn slave and stay away from home. I want at least 2-3 jobs if possible. If any of you have any summer job ideas mention it in the comments. \n\nEdit: I will add on later stay tuned.",

Other then not having to deal with periods, becoming pregnant and not being safe to walk in a dark alley or a park during night time i fail to see how its not a massive disadvantage to be a man in this society...\n\n1. Men suicide 4x more then woman. One dude i know already lost 3 of his M friends to suicide!!! And personally I have lost my brother to suicide when he was 23.\n2. 2.Men are pretty much almost twice as susceptible to end up abusing drugs/alcohol (\\~6% vs \\~12% for men).\n3. 70% of homeless people are men.\n4. Men have 10x + chance to die in the workplace.\n5. Men have next to no social support and networks compared to woman.\n6. Men are 2.5x more likely to develop videogame addiction (probably because real life sucks more for them I know that its a good way to avoid having to deal with reality)\n7. Men don't do as well in school at least not with the modern system and woman are more present in higher education programs and obtain more diplomas then men.\n8. It is way harder for men to find a partner( IMO especially since the rise of dating websites and social medias). I think a good proof is there's way less women using dating apps then there are men, i assume simply out of a lack of necessity in the first place.\n9. Pretty sure woman live on average 8 years longer then men, because life is fair like that lol.\n10. Young woman nowadays earn more money then young men meanwhile young men are still most of the time expected to provide for their families and even be a bigger earner then his female partner. Not even going to get into dating/romantic stuff (early relationship / dating life).\n11. When shit goes down for your country youre more likely to be forcefully enrolled in the army. and when shit goes down in any other situation you're almost expected to be brave and know how to fight and even defend other people, or just having to resolve things by violence when dealing with other men.\n12. Getting fucked over in court and losing custody unless something is terribly wrong with the mother.\n13. How modern tv/ads/movies (hollywood in particular) has recently started to make men look stupid, foolish and inferior, there is almost no inspirational roles portraying strong male characters anymore, now its only strong female characters and they're hella overpowered, they make sure the audience knows without a doubt that they're doing everything better then men.\n14. I don't care if its a small minority or if they have been lucky with good genetics, young woman can use onlyfans if they are willing and they can earn way more in their 20's alone then a doctor or any other top tier job man ever could in his entire life. Meanwhile I also have good genetics and I am young but if I did the same I wouldn't even be able to afford a bag of chips a month with my earnings i bet...  You will say, well woman with good genetics go to modeling and pornography, and men with good genetics go to sports... But I'm pretty sure it's quite a bit harder to become a pro NFL player or something then it is to strip naked on onlyfans or show some cleavage on twitch while licking a plastic ear and moaning.\n15. Woman have WAY higher standards in general and specifically on dating apps/websites where they will swipe a guy positively a lot less often then a man will swipe a woman positively, which means the competition to find a partner is astonishingly harder as the average man. Not even close. I've even heard 2% swipe rate meanwhile men swipe HARD. I don't really want to discuss men swipe rate because I've heard that a lot of them will literally swipe all the girls, not that this is a pro-male argument anyways lol, it means theyre literally so desperate...\n\nI have named most of the reasons why it sucks to be a male, it was a good venting/rant session. I am now ready to recieve the backlash of people calling me a misogynist because I think being a man sucks compared to being a woman.",

    "text": "Ukraine is going to ban men from leaving the country for at least 3 years after the war ends For those that don’t know, Ukraine is currently baning all men, aged 18-60, from leaving the country. For comparison, women are free to leave anytime, even if they hold military related positions like doctors. Considering that since the start of the war more than 7 million people (basically, women, children and elderies) already left the country, Ukraine has some serious demographic problems. But instead of motivating people to stay, at least by trying to lower the rates of corruption, it only makes stricter restrictions. \n\nVadym Denysenko is the head of Institute of the Future of Ukraine (this organization is partially funded by the EU), one of the people's deputies of Ukraine, and a member of Ukrainian Committee on Legal Policy and Justice. In the past he also was a famous journalist and an ex-adviser of the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. He is one of the highly influential politicians who actively these misogynistic restrictions. In his last proposal he stated that man must be banned from leaving Ukraine for at least (!) 3 years after the end of the war. His reasoning goes that if men are let out of the country, Ukraine might not be able to survive as a nation, as it would mean that it would lose at least 1 million people more.\n\nIn reality, such restrictions won’t lead to anything good for the future of Ukraine. Basically, it just means that even more people would be happy to leave the country on the first moment, and afterwards never return ever again. And seeing brave men who either try to bribe (I’m highly against bribery, but in this situation its the only way) officials to leave the country, which often gets them arrested, or to escape the country using alternative ways, like trying to swim over the cold Tysa river, to get to Romania and ask for political asylum there, which leads to them drowning in pain, or getting shot by Ukrainian border guards. And the saddest part is that human rights organizations just close their eyes on this madness. I’m talking about big names like UN, European court of Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and more. I’m not even talking about taking people like mr. Vadym, and others who brings men-only slavery back, to a military tribunal. \n\nSources:\n\nVadyms Facebook post: https://www.facebook.com/vadym.denysenko.1/posts/pfbid02GDHc1tVX6k3BKjVrFjAhK8pmLh31VDqEot4RySzLwYUF8zybXWHraFANQgPGaK2Cl\n\nVadyms partial biography: https://uifuture.org/administracziya/vadym-denysenko/",

(38), through an arranged marriage in 2005. Before getting married, Mustafa Y. had a health issue and underwent a surgery that doctors told him was necessary but could make him unable to have children.\n\nMustafa Y. and A.Y. did not have a child for 10 years. He started an herbal medicine treatment that he saw on TV. During this time, his wife A.Y. said she was pregnant. Mustafa Y. was very happy to have a child and even bought a  car on loan for his wife's comfort during pregnancy. A.Y. gave birth to a girl in a private hospital in July 2015 after the pregnancy period.\n\nLater, the arguing couple decided to divorce. When A.Y. filed for divorce, Mustafa Y., on the advice of his lawyer, asked for a DNA test for the child, saying he couldn't be the father due to his health issues. The DNA test and forensic report in September 2019 showed he was not the father. In January 2020, Mustafa Y. filed for divorce and cancellation of paternity.\n\nThe lawsuits were combined. The court granted divorce but ordered A.Y. to pay 40,000 TL in material and moral damages to Mustafa Y. A.Y. The appellate court canceled the compensation order but  ordered Mustafa Y. to pay A.Y. monthly interim alimony of 400 TL until divorce finalization, and a one-time poverty alimony of 12,000 TL in favor of the woman.\n\nMustafa Y. appealed this decision to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, saying Mustafa Y.'s  adultery-based divorce lawsuit  was filed outside the 5-year statute of limitations, so the woman cannot be found at fault for adultery. Considering the case file, the man could not prove any other faulty behavior by the woman, so she should have been awarded appropriate material and moral damages, which the lower court failed to do.\n\nMustafa Y. said that he suffered trauma when he learned the child was not his. \"I had a stroke. I was in the ICU  for 20 days during the  pandemic period. During this time, doctors told my relatives that I only  had a 20% chance of surviving. After getting  out of the ICU, I couldn't speak for a while, and I still have weakness  in my right hand. This has become permanent after the illness.\" This incident caused him  about 1 million lira in financial loss. \"I still can't accept this, I can't sleep at nights. I don't know at all who the father of the child  is, but I'm curious. Let this person come forward and serve the  punishment for the torment they have caused me. They can't restore my  health but they should face the consequences.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Look at the depth of insight we have into her mind from 30 years of therapy! She felt SO open to talk about her feelings and we helped her SO much! Unfortunately though, she did attempt suicide twice. Granted, it's not like she shot herself in the head and got lucky and survive it. On the first one, she told ER doctors that she took a few pills and felt like her life was meaningless, and the other time she felt really REALLY bad about a break up. I mean she felt REALLY REALLY REALLY bad. In fact, she was convinced that she was dying from it! She INSISTED that both of these experiences were bona fide suicide attempts. So yea she definitely checked ALL of our boxes. Poor lady. THIRTY YEARS she went through this! On the other hand, the man committed suicide at age 18 without ever even trying therapy, and so we actually no longer have any record that he ever existed in the first place. So mark it down: one suicidal woman and one possibly suicidal man.    \n\n\nSeriously, how else does a university professor possibly get it in her head that females are more suicidal?",

Respond?\"\n\nI am glad to say that the majority of the replies were sensible women telling her not to freak out on him for not texting for a mere day and a half, bring him some food, or just stop by to check on him and offer help. \n\nIf my man was hurt, there's no way I'd sit around and debate responding because we weren't in touch for 30 hours, I'd get right over and make sure he's comfy and looked after. \n\nHowever, there were a few (6-10) comments that made me so...pissed?  The women who wrote these comments were assuming that he was cheating, and being flakey, or being lazy because, \"How hard is it to take your phone and type a few words?\" said by a woman who complained that her boyfriend did this to her when he had severe migraines.  Several women replied to her to explain how awful migraines are and how looking at a phone screen is not something comfortable to do.  Another woman said: \"I'd do the same thing to him but permanantly!\"(as in she'd leave her bf in that situation because he didn't text for 30 hours).\n\nI'm glad that most of the women there gave reasonable advice but reading that comment thread reminded me of how when men get hurt or injured, it isn't taken seriously unless it's really, really bad.  \n\nFor example, my parents are getting divorced.   I've been keeping in touch with my dad and he hasn't been doing too good.  He was to get surgury for a hernia, plus he twisted his kneecap sometime ago and had to get an injection in his knee so he could walk properly. A few days ago, he was at work and his leg gave out on him 3 times so he had to go back to the doctor for another injection.  He missed 2-3 days of work.   His knee does require surgery as well to fix whatever is wrong but I guess he can't afford to take the time off for that so he's going to get a knee brace.  \n\nMy mom asked me if I had talked to him recently and I said yes, and then she complained that he didn't send her his 'contribution' for the month.  My dad doesn't like to have his personal things mentioned to her and vice versa but I thought my mother might care that he's not doing to well and understand, so I told her about his recent injuries and how that will affect whether he can send anything or not.\n\nWell I don't know why I had such high expectations, she did not seem to care and was still upset about not getting a contribution to help pay bills and whatnot, and complained that 'how can he not send anything when he WAS going to help you buy your graduation dress' to which I explained he'd probably sacrifice something to be able to pay for that (which I didn't want, it's not worth it) but that doesn't mean he has enough!  I understand that the current economy is making it difficult to live but it's not so hard to have some empathy is it?  \n\nIt's just so fustrating and sad that some women can't give some compassion and care when a man is injured.",

    "text": "Debunking the \"Gender Pay Gap\" Copied from the [original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TraditionalMuslims/comments/14p3dwq/debunking_the_gender_pay_gap/).\n\nSo I didn't think I needed to debunk this as it's been done a million times before. However, it's come to my attention that apparently some still believe it. So, just to have an easy-to-reference, codified treatise on the issue, I'm writing this piece to utterly decimate this commonly propagated liberal trope.\n\nMainstream media presents [articles like this](https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-wage-pay-gap-charts-2017-3) that claim there is a pay gap between men and women, and that it's on the sole basis of gender. While it is true that men tend to earn more money than women, it is absolutely false that it's due to gender bias in favor of men (if anything, it's actually in favor of women). The problem with the statistics shown is that they only take into account median yearly salaries without accounting for any other confounding variables that may be skewing the data. For example, if I told you that the more people drown the more often ice cream is sold, would you take that to mean that ice cream causes people to drown? No, you'd probably say that it's because of ice cream sales increasing in the summer when it's hot, which is simultaneously when people go swimming more, thereby increasing the likelihood of drownings to happen; this shared commonality (i.e. the heat) is a confounding variable.\n\nFor the so-called \"gender pay gap\", here are the confounding variables:\n\n1. This statistic does not account for what types of jobs are being worked, as **men choose higher-paying jobs**.\n   * [*Source 1.*](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.1120.0757) *Demonstrates how women choose different jobs than men because they value and/or prioritize different things than men (e.g. better work-life balance). Because of this, the jobs they prefer tend to be lower-paying.*\n   * [*Source 2.*](https://academic.oup.com/oep/article-abstract/57/3/479/2361925?redirectedFrom=fulltext) *Same as Source 1, but also found that \"job satisfaction of men increases with additional earnings while that of women does not\" (p. 486).*\n   * [*Source 3.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719) *Landmark study; displays evidence that men choose higher-paying jobs. The more egalitarian/feminist a country is, the fewer women choose careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (i.e. traditionally male-dominated roles). Giving greater career choice to women increases (apparent) gender disparities within the workforce.*\n   * [*Source 4.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2525981) *Cited over 11,600 times. Demonstrated very directly that women choose jobs that are lower-paying, and that women are NOT being paid less to do equal work; and this was in 1973, almost 50 years ago. Please note that any discrimination found thereafter is really just residual unaccounted variability rather than actual discrimination per se, as detailed in the conclusion.*\n   * [*Source 5.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243210361475) *So ignoring the ideological bullshit that's indirectly being pushed, it demonstrates clearly that women choose different jobs than men and that it is solely due to their own choice; and that the only time women don't choose traditionally female jobs over male jobs is when they're essentially forced to take the male job.*\n      * *Interestingly enough, this supports the findings of* [*this study here*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719) *(which was a MASSIVE, catastrophic blow to the \"men and women are equal but female oppression and gender discrimination are the only reason why we aren't\" narrative); the researchers found that the more egalitarian/feministic a society is, the greater the gender differences will be (regarding what people will choose to pursue). In other words, when you give women free choice to pursue whatever they want, they will willfully choose occupations/education/life goals that will only increase the gender gap between men and women.*\n2. The statistic does not account for **different positions within a respective field** (e.g. head/lead developer vs senior developer vs junior developer; they're all developers, but different rankings/positions). We know this because it's not possible to know the relative rankings/positions of people's careers if they don't even know what those careers are in the first place.\n   * [*Source 6.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1808858) *Looked at a company from the years 1966 and 1969-1971; found no gender discrimination when accounting for all variables. States that at most, there may be gender discrimination with regards to promotion, but even this is speculative as it is not explained why this may be the case (and truth be told, we already know why this is; I will explain later on). If the concept of a gender wage gap was already being debunked/disproved back then, it definitely doesn't exist now (at least, not in favor of men anyway...).*\n   * [*Source 7.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30038574) *Studies a company that was sued for ACTUALLY discriminating against women with regards to promotion, and found that there wasn't any pay differences between men and women who were given the same job/assignment. In other words, even when discriminating against women, they were still being fair about the pay.*\n3. The statistic does not account for **age** (e.g. a young person may make more money than an older person in a physically-taxing field, older people in fields that would require more knowledge/wisdom to handle, etc.).\n   * [*Source 8.*](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26623) *Generally speaking, workers over age 40 are only about half as likely to get a job offer as younger workers if employers know their age*\n4. The statistic does not account for **job tenure** (i.e. how long someone has been working for their respective employer for).\n   * [*Source 9.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122413514584) *Shows men in general have greater job tenure than women. It's decreasing overall (particularly for men) but there are various reasons for it, many of which are oftentimes advantageous from a career/monetary standpoint, which men are going to be more receptive towards since men typically prioritize money more than other aspects of a career (see Source 1).*\n   * [*Source 10.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831432) *It's in the title; job tenure typically entails higher wages. In recent times, this has been changing within certain fields (hence why it's been decreasing as shown in Source 8 above), but the point still stands overall.*\n5. **Men work more than women**, which implicates in the previous 2 points with men being able to develop greater job tenure and work experience. More men work full-time than women. Moreover, the term 'full-time\" means anyone working 35 hours or more (with some lowering it to 30 hours or more to further skew the stats in favor of their social agenda); this could mean anywhere from 35 hours to 135 hours per week, and I can tell you right now that the vast majority of people who are working an exorbitantly high number of hours are men, NOT women.\n   * [*Source 11.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2015/time-spent-working-by-full-and-part-time-status-gender-and-location-in-2014.htm) *Statistics from the US government. Men simply work more than women, even when comparing men who work full-time to women who work full-time, and men who work part-time to women who work part-time.*\n   * [*Source 12.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2019/pdf/home.pdf) *More statistics from the US government for 2019.*\n      * *\"Among full-time workers, those usually working at a job 35 hours or more per week, men are more likely than women to work more than 40 hours per week. In 2019, 25 percent of men who usually work full time worked 41 or more hours per week, compared with 14 percent of women. Women were more likely than men to work 35 to 39 hours per week: 10 percent of women worked such hours in 2019, while 4 percent of men did\" (p. 8).*\n      * *Women were more likely to be working a part-time job than men.*\n      * *\"Women who worked part time made up 23 percent of all female wage and salary workers in 2019. In comparison, 11 percent of men in wage and salary jobs worked part time.\"*\n   * [*Source 13.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2020/pdf/home.pdf) *Even more statistics from the US government for 2020.*\n      * *19.6% of men working full-time worked 41 or more hours per week, compared to only 10.2% of women who were working full-time. This means that men working full-time were nearly twice as likely as women to work 41 hours per work or more (Table 5). This coincides with* [data discussed at the 2019 G20 Summit](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---cabinet/documents/publication/wcms_713376.pdf)*.*\n      * *Men working full-time were also 2.3 times more likely than women to work 60+ hour weeks: 4.3% of men worked 60 hours per week or more compared to only 1.9% of women.*\n      * *Women working full-time were more than twice as likely as men to work shorter workweeks of 35 to 39 hours per week: 7.7% of full-time women worked those hours, compared to only 3.6% of men who did so.*\n      * *Men working 35-39 hours per week earned only 92.4% of what women earned working those same hours ($600 median weekly earnings for men vs. $649 for women). This means there was a 7.6% gender earnings gap in favor of female workers (for that cohort), and this is BEFORE accounting for any confounding variables!!!*\n      * *Women were more likely to be working a part-time job than men.*\n      * *Although not reported by the BLS, it can be estimated using its data that the average workweek for full-time workers (in 2020) was 41.3 hours for women and 42.8 hours for men, meaning the average man employed full-time worked 1.5 more hours per week compared to the average woman. This adds up to men, on average, having worked an additional 78 hours per year compared to the average full-time female worker.*\n      * *Some of the raw earnings gap naturally disappears by simply controlling for some of the variables. For example, women technically earned 82.3% of median male earnings for all workers working 35+ hours per week (i.e. full-time). But for those workers with a 40-hour workweek (more than three-quarters of all full-time female workers), women earned 87.4% of median male earnings, and that's after accounting for just one variable: hours worked.*\n      * *For young, full-time workers aged 16-24, women earned 94.7% of the median earnings of their male counterparts. Once again, controlling for just a single important variable—age—we find that more than two-thirds of the \"gender pay gap\" disappears. There are tons of other factors like these that go unaccounted for when you hear people/the media talk about the gender pay gap. Keep this in mind from now on.*\n   * [*Source 14.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2008/02/art5full.pdf) *Conducted by the US government. Looks at 12 European nations and shows that men work more than women in all of the countries studied, among many other things.*\n   * [*Source 15.*](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t04.htm) *Government statistics for 2021. Men clearly work more than women.*\n   * [*Source 16.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00197939211045376) *Some people may not think that men work more than women enough to help warrant the pay gap, but this paper explains otherwise (they basically accounted for the jobs being worked and how men and women vary in the number of hours worked within these specific jobs rather than ignoring the types of jobs worked).*\n6. Building off the previous point, **men work more overtime**, and the gender pay gap statistic does not account for overtime pay. And if men are working more hours than women, that means that men are going to make more money from overtime which is higher than your standard base rate.\n   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *This is one of my favorite studies ever. It's just so well-done and is, in my opinion, the epitome of what research is supposed to look like. It was conducted by Harvard University, and one of the authors is literally a woman (meaning there isn't any bias caused by sexism or misogyny on behalf of the authors). It demonstrates a multitude of things, but as it relates to this specific point, it shows clearly that men work more overtime than women (p. 2–3; Figure A.16, p. 85).*\n7. **Men are more likely to accept overtime, and especially when presented without prior notice** (e.g. if someone had an emergency and couldn't come in, and employees are asked if they can stay, men are more likely to accept it). This means men tend to be more reliable workers overall. It's technically a separate point from the one above because the frequency of accepting overtime is different from actually working it (e.g. someone could work a lot of overtime one week and not work it at all for the next 12 weeks, vs someone who works only a few hours of overtime every week).\n   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *Also shows how men are more likely to accept overtime when it's presented to them and that men in general are especially more likely to accept overtime without prior notice (p. 3; Figure 6, p. 49; Figure A.17, p. 86).*\n8. **Men are less likely to have unexcused absences.**\n   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *Women have more unexcused leave of absences than men (Figure 22, p. 65). This further implicates men as being more reliable workers. What's ironic is that men face harsher penalties/disciplinary measures than women (Figure 21, p. 64), contrary to popular belief.*\n9. The statistic does not account for **work experience** (i.e. how long someone has been working in their respective field).\n   * [*Source 18.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2535309) *In general, men have greater work experience than women (courtesy of working more than women); the timing of work experience and overall work matters a lot as well, and since men are simply working more than women, the advantages of this timing will be more apparent in men than women. This study has data directly showing that men have greater actual work experience, potential work experience, and job tenure than women (the last of which relates back to the previous numbered point).*\n10. **Men do not get pregnant and are less likely to leave work for kids** (e.g. paternity leave); pregnancy forces women to stop working, which relates back to points 4, 5, 8, and 9, and men being less likely to leave work for kids also shows more dedication to work.\n      * [*Source 19.*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwao.12506) *The abstract alone states \"mothers with young children have reduced their work hours four to five times more than fathers\". Some of you may say that this therefore nullifies Source 12 as supporting evidence for point 5, but it actually strengthens it because it exemplifies the gender differences that can cause a skew in the gender wage gap myth and highlights the behavioral dimorphism between the sexes. At most, it would only nullify SOME of its generalizability on a year-to-year basis, but even then, it still showcases how statistics can be skewed/misrepresented to provide a false narrative about gender discrimination that doesn't actually exist with regards to pay. Anyway, Source 13 also states similar as well due to the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) where women are far more likely to leave work/not come in, but I don't want to be redundant and keep using the same source even though it's a fantastic study.*\n11. **Men are less likely to take sick days.**\n      * [*Source 20.*](https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/68/5/320/4973626) *Women take more sick leave than men, even after accounting for many variables.*\n      * [*Source 21.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6070205/) *The introduction alone is enough to show that women take more sick leave than men, this is undisputed and has been for decades. This study sought to determine whether there were differences in attitudes towards sick leave based on gender, and whether this contributes to women's absenteeism. They did not find much support for this, indicating that women take more sick leave regardless of societal norms and expectations.*\n      * [*Source 22.*](https://journals.lww.com/joem/Abstract/2015/08000/High_Job_Demands,_Job_Strain,_and_Iso_Strain_Are.5.aspx) *Women take more sick leave due to mental health reasons than men (p. 860), with 90% of \"mental health\" reasons being either stress, mood, and/or anxiety-related.*\n12. **Men are less likely to take vacation days.**\n      * [*Source 23.*](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1019.5400&rep=rep1&type=pdf) *Great study that shows how women take more vacation days than men, while also discussing why it is the case. Has several other findings/key points that showcase male-female dimorphism as it relates to work and the family, and they are very interesting; they essentially prove what is already self-evident with regards to gender roles, despite what mainstream society is trying to push today.*\n13. **Men are more likely to move for a job.**\n      * [*Source 24.*](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol40/53/40-53.pdf) *Shows conclusively that men are more willing to move for a job. They try to say that single women are just as likely as single men to move for a job after accounting for confounding variables, but that's nonsense because one of the variables was essentially how well they like the job (i.e. \"job characteristics\"), when the location of a job doesn't have an impact on how much the job itself should or should not be liked (and if any of you researchers disagree, you will need to account for the Halo Effect to fully make sure that distance isn't what's making them view those same \"job characteristics\" as distasteful enough for them to not want to move). It's as if they're trying to say that jobs should cater to women by changing how they operate so women will like them better, rather than simply just acknowledge that women do not want to move for work as much as men. In fact, it's not even as if they're saying that, they literally suggest it lmao! It's very gynocentric when you look at it. The reason why they say this is because they do not want to admit that the gender gap is literally caused by women's own personal preferences, because then that would mean that the gender gap is normal, natural, and that women willfully make the choices that cause the gender gap, essentially nullifying any narrative that women are victims of oppression and that the gender differences that exist between men and women are caused by men and women ACTUALLY being different. This last point really irks the ideologues. In addition, it would place accountability over the gender gap on women, and women absolutely cannot handle having accountability.*\n      * [*Source 25.*](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/app/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/GD_ResearchReport_MetroMovers_Draft4-1.pdf) *Literally the same thing as the previous source (including all of the progressive diatribes that I dismantled) but with a massive online job search website.*\n      * [*Source 26.*](https://web.stanford.edu/~niederle/CEN_discrimination.pdf) *This one has some progressivism within it as well, but ignoring that, we find that any discrimination against women isn't due to them on the sole basis of them being women, but rather because of beliefs over how well they would do the job. In fact, it shows that people are MORE likely to favor women as job candidates when a negative belief is ascribed to a woman rather than when it is ascribed without the gender being stated. In other words, gender discrimination isn't gender discrimination at all but rather performance discrimination, which is the definition of a meritocracy (i.e. a system in which people are judged based on their merit/how good they are at their job, rather than characteristics unrelated to said job/merit).*\n14. **Men are more likely to work night shifts.**\n      * [*Source 26.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2021/article/nonstandard-work-schedules-in-29-european-countries-2005-15-differences-by-education-gender-and-parental-status.htm) *Government study looking at data across 29 European nations from 2005-2015. It shows that in every region, save for Scandinavia, men are more likely than women to work hours outside the standard 9-5. This coincides with data from Source 14 and Source 17, which showed similar findings.*\n      * [*Source 27.*](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3216/3084) *Shows definitively that men are more likely to work night shifts than women.*\n15. **Men are more likely to work weekends.**\n      * [*Source 27.*](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3216/3084) *Also shows that men are more likely to work weekends than women.*\n      * [*Source 28.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2011/07/art1full.pdf) *While also showing that men are more likely to work nonstandard work shifts, it also shows that men are more likely to work weekends as well, which Source 11, Source 14, Source 15, and Source 17 also demonstrated.*\n16. **Men are more likely to work holidays.**\n      * *Yet again, this was already shown by Source 11, Source 14, and Source 15.*\n17. **Men are far more likely to work dangerous jobs** such as oil riggers, underwater welders, etc. These male-dominated jobs pay higher than nurses and hair stylists on the basis of danger, hence why it's separate from the first point.\n      * [*Source 29.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4880472/) *Men are more likely to work dangerous jobs and are simply more willing to accept risks that jobs may have in general. This is represented by the fact that men make up most workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 30.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfoi2004_chart11.pdf) *US government data for 2004; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (93%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 31.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfoi2006_14.pdf) *US government data for 2006; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (92%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 32.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/osh/os/oshs2008_33.pdf) *US government data for 2008; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (93%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 33.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfch0009.pdf) *US government data for 2010; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (92%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 34.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfch0011.pdf) *US government data for 2012; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (92%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 35.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cftb0292.pdf) *US government data from 2014; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (92%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 36.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfoi-chart-data-2017.htm) *US government data from 2017; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (93%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 37.*](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cfoi.pdf) *US government data from 2016-2020; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (93%, 93%, 92%, 92%, 92% for each consecutive year, respectively) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 38.*](https://www.ualberta.ca/anesthesiology-pain-medicine/media-library/eliassons-wellness-docs/mens-mental-health/a-roadmap-to-mens-health.pdf) *97% of workplace deaths in Canada between 1993 and 2005 were men.*\n         * [*Source 39.*](https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-11/Work-related%20traumatic%20injury%20fatalities%20Australia%202019.pdf) *97% of workplace deaths in Australia were men in 2019, with similar trends from 2003-2018 as well. These are the things feminists will never, ever talk about.*\n18. **Men are more interested in jobs that are scalable**; men are more interested in physical things, while women are more interested in jobs that deal with people. The former is scalable, the latter is not; that means Elon Musk is able to service millions of people with Tesla whereas Mrs. Johnson is only able to teach a class of 30 students per year. This point is separate from the first point because scalability relates to potential growth/earning, and based on the laws of chance, you're more likely to find some major hit successes in professions that are scalable rather than unscalable.\n      * [*Source 40.*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19883140/) *Meta-analysis showing men are interested in things, and that women are interested in people.*\n      * [*Source 41.*](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00189/full) *Another meta-analysis that supports the previous one above; \"patterns of gender differences in interests and the actual gender composition in STEM fields were explained by the people-orientation and things-orientation of work environments\". Basically, even in male-dominated fields, women are overrepresented in service-based and people-oriented STEM fields such as the health sciences, with the trend being found on a multinational level. This also acts as evidence for the very first point about men choosing higher-paying jobs.*\n         * [*Source 42.*](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_aa2018.htm) *Evidence from the US showing this trend with women.*\n         * [*Source 43.*](https://afmc.ca/sites/default/files/pdf/CMES/CMES2018-Complete_EN.pdf) *Evidence from Canada showing this trend with women.*\n         * [*Source 44.*](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/health-at-a-glance-2017/doctors-by-age-sex-and-category_health_glance-2017-53-en) *Evidence from OECD countries (38 in total, with another 10 non-OECD countries included throughout in some data).*\n19. **Men are more likely to ask for a raise.**\n      * [*Source 45.*](https://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/16689) *Men are more likely to ask for a raise; the only exception is when women enter managerial positions (i.e. are put in male roles, basically). It also shows that women are basically worse at negotiating than men (\"less successful\" = euphemism for being worse at).*\n      * [*Source 46.*](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1994) *Women are only as likely as men to ask for a raise when they are explicitly told they can negotiate for one. I can tell you right now that most jobs rarely ever directly tell its employees that they can freely ask for a raise lol.*\n      * [*Source 47.*](https://escholarship.org/content/qt9978v172/qt9978v172.pdf?t=omys3w) *Women are less comfortable engaging in salary negotiations, they're less likely to negotiate salaries overall, and they're not as good at it as men (the researchers don't word this last point this way because it angers feminists, but that's the gist of it). There are many other reasons that they go into as well.*\n20. **Men are typically more aggressive/competitive in their mindset and attitudes regarding work** which helps them climb the corporate ladder more (e.g. you make more off commission in sales because you close more sales due to being more competitive).\n      * [*Source 48.*](https://archive.bio.org/sites/default/files/docs/toolkit/Why%20Men%20Still%20Get%20More%20Promotions%20than%20Women_HBR%20article.pdf) *Upon reading this, you find that women are essentially not as willing to do what it takes to climb the corporate ladder; the report says that therefore the entire civilizational structure should change to favor women, but that's just ridiculous. Why not just admit that women are not as willing to hyperfocus on their careers in the same way as men? Why not just admit that women don't do it because they simply don't want to sacrifice other areas of their life for a career? Why not just finally admit that women are different from men? They can't. And that's a problem for BOTH genders.*\n21. **The top people are always going to be men due to the variability hypothesis.**\n      * [*Source 49.*](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/493921) *Men vary greater than women; when seeing any of the extremes, men are more likely to be represented on both ends. That means the most successful people in the world are going to overwhelmingly be men, and the most unsuccessful dregs of society will also be men. This represents a problem with feminist thinking because they want \"equality\" when it comes to powerful, important, and successful positions in society and say that a lack thereof in these top positions are due to sexism and discrimination (and that therefore all of men and society need to just give women these positions to \"make it fair\"), but they will never talk about the men at the lowest ends of society or talk about equalizing that. I'm not saying they should become homeless criminals and whatnot either (rather they should focus on decreasing the amount of men that are disenfranchised here; but they'll never do that since they would have to admit that men aren't oppressors and would have to actually acknowledge the plights of men), I'm just saying there's a double standard here whereby women want the rights and privileges of both sexes with the responsibilities of neither, all the while blaming men for any (and all) of their own shortcomings and faults.*\n      * [*Source 50.*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886913003036) *Men vary more than women yet also tend to be better on average on measures of creativity.*\n      * [*Source 51.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variability_hypothesis#:~:text=The%20variability%20hypothesis%2C%20also%20known,most%20traits%20than%20females%20do.) *For those who still don't get it, here's a Wikipedia article since they tend to describe things fairly simply and succinctly.*\n\nJust to really drive home the point, I quote the official statement of the US Department of Labor after having a massive [study](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2019/pdf/home.pdf) conducted for them:\n\n>**This study leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a multitude of factors and that the raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action. Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers.**\n\nAnd even ignoring the technical research aspects, just think about it like this: If a woman were to do the same job as a man for less pay, only women would get hired because that would be CHEAP LABOR. And for those who don't know, there's a whole sexism argument that claims men get hired more easily than men (which also isn't necessarily true either, but that's a separate discussion).\n\nThere isn't a single statistician who isn't braindead, let alone competent, who takes the statistics presented about the gender pay gap myth at face value when drawing conclusions. It's only after you account for all the variables available can you really begin to extrapolate true causality, and even then it is still weak with these types of statistical analyses anyway since it's virtually impossible to account for every variable that exists *and* have a full consensus for data rather than a statistic that has a much smaller sample size. Plus, when it comes to statistical analyses like this, you're ultimately seeing how things relate to one another (i.e. correlated) rather than seeing how they directly influence/cause something. The only way to truly test for causality is by running actual experiments with strong controls in place (which is nigh on impossible to do in situations like these). If you take a statistics class or two, you'll learn about this stuff more in-depth. Multivariate analyses are pretty much always better than univariate ones (when drawing final conclusions from, anyway), and it's due to reasons like this where society perpetuates the gender pay gap myth as a social dogma.\n\nIf women can do anything men can do (and \"do it better\"), then why are they still supposedly \"oppressed\"? Why are they still the victims? And why do they need government legislation to mandate \"gender equality\" in order to achieve it? If they were really the same as men (i.e. \"equal\") in all these regards, wouldn't perfect equality naturally occur based on merit alone? It doesn't make sense, and it's simply because it's just not true. Men and women aren't the same, and we won't ever be the same. That doesn't mean we shouldn't be treated fairly—equity over equality, always—but this myth needs to die once and for all.\n\n﷽\n\nوَلَا تَتَمَنَّوْا۟ مَا فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِۦ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ ۚ لِّلرِّجَالِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا ٱكْتَسَبُوا۟ ۖ وَلِلنِّسَآءِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا ٱكْتَسَبْنَ ۚ وَسْـَٔلُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مِن فَضْلِهِۦٓ ۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمًا",

    "text": "I am so so very tired from the overtime I need to work because of women in the teams I work with who aren't functioning. I'm working until midnight day after day and into the weekend week after week. It's all a lie. Almost no woman I work with who has a demanding position actually works. I do it all Such women have the degree (I have it too) or a title in the email signature three-four words long.  Equal, no? Well no. Most of the time, almost always, she won't have a clue on how to do the work her job requires. They will spread confident statements that will sound knowledgeable but if you actually know what they are talking about you will know it's complete nonsense - mistakes and fabrications - they are simply making it up (instead of simply looking it up). It becomes obvious to you after a while that they see their competence not as being skillful, experienced and as a result very effective - but as being good at throwing around the right \"buzz sentences\" to make it look as if they are someone you can trust with that job. They will send you their \"completed task\" and it will almost always be half baked. You will need to do your share - and 50% or more of theirs, you will need to spend more time on fixing problems they created (by never asking how something is done and instead \"throwing something\"), and then you will find out that while they know you are leaning over your computer at 10 pm working to fix it, they are out of office.\n\nThese \"a woman can do anything a man can\" women, holding \"same position as a man\", simply create a facade, a theater show. Mostly the only thing equal to a man they have is the job title and degree - they don't actually have the knowledge, know how to do the job or put in the effort needed, rather, the \"equal number of women\" in such positions is made possible by men doing their own 100% and then 50% of the women's work.\n\nThis is the reality of it all. Not all women in these positions are like that - absolutely not! I worked with bright, hard-working, responsible, knowledgeable women (\"knowledgeable\" means: being responsible enough to spend time looking for all the needed knowledge and making sure you really understand it, instead of relying on mumbling something and on someone else \"taking care of it\"), who will hold their end of the pole with you and won't let go until it's in place, but they were a rare sight. In nine out of ten cases, it would be sleepless nights, no weekends, to do the woman's part and then some (as for men, my experience was that they do their best - each according to his capacity. If they're not holding their end it's because their mother is in hospital, not because they don't want to \\[edit: come to think of it, a slouchy man in these responsible roles just gets replaced as soon as everyone have time to breath again. Maybe knowing this pushes men to deliver while women might get the opposite message - we need you for the body count so as long as you don't shoot a missile at the office you won't get replaced\\]. And if men don't know something they just say it and ask, instead of inventing nonsense that create problems that you need to then solve. Them not minding their \"ego\" and simply asking for instructions saves unimaginable amounts of time). Has anyone else had this experience? Any doctors or engineers here who can tell how it works in their field? (I'm so tired).",

    "text": "Invisible war on men: This is how misandry kills millions The gap between the average male and female life expectancy of given population group is alternately labeled as **Life Expectancy Gender Gap (LEGG)** or **Gender Gap in Life Expectancy (GGLE)**. Going forward I will be using the LEGG acronym.\n\n# The lost years\n\nThe first important thing to know about the LEGG is that its impact is, without an exaggeration, enormous. Let's take for example the US, with a [LEGG of 5.8 years](https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&series=SP.DYN.LE00.MA.IN&country=) at the average predicted age for men and women 73.5 and 79.3 years respectively. Do you see the enormity? No, you don't?\n\nOk, let's put things into perspective - how do you measure an impact of early death? With **Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL)**. This measure is based on an estimate of years a person would have lived if they had not died prematurely. It is usually reported in years per 100,000 people and the reference \"mature\" age should correspond roughly to the life expectancy of the population and is now usually given as 75 years. Now, men and women in the US lose some [8,265 and 4,862](https://data.oecd.org/healthstat/potential-years-of-life-lost.htm) potential years of life per 100,000. Given the population as 332 millions, men lose some **5,648,980** more years of potential life than women. Do you see the enormity now? Not yet?\n\nDuring the roughly 3.5 years of WW2 the [US lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties) some 407,300 military and 12,100 civilian lives. With an average life expectancy back then cca 68 years, and a guestimated average age at the time of death 21 years, every killed American lost some 47 years. That means the US as a whole lost some **5,640,000** potential years of life every year of the war. \n\nIn other words, there is an invisible perpetual war that kills as many men every year as WW2. Do you see the enormity of the LEGG now? I think you do.\n\n# The causes\n\nThe second important think to know about the LEGG is that nobody seem to care. Biologists, statisticians, politicians, Wikipedians - **not even men's rights activists** \\- nobody seems to be franticly looking for the causes and proposing policies to stop this haemorrhage of men's lives. Let me summarise what [Wikipedia has to says about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy#Sex_differences):\n\n* It is the life style - men drink more, smoke more and eat crap. There is nothing we can do or should do.\n* And it is also the biology - men lack the protective double X chromosome and have higher rate of mitochondrial mutations. We see this across all mammalian species. There is nothing we can do or should do.\n* Females have have higher mortality as foetuses but lover mortality as premature babies. That is why male babies and boys dies of diseases much more than girls. There is nothing we can do or should do.\n\n(Speaking of Wikipedia, it has dedicated articles for many things, including the [Orgasm gender gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgasm_gap), but it does not have a dedicated article for the LEGG.)\n\nTo my surprise I have not been able to find any further information, neither on biology forums, nor on Google Scholar. Studies usually focus on one cause or divide the mechanisms into [social and biological](https://academic.oup.com/inthealth/article/13/5/482/6127106?login=false) but there our knowledge seem to end. I am not a statistician nor a biologist but I know how to use excel and at this point I was so frustrated that I decided to \"do my own research\". \n\n# \"The research\"\n\n1/\n\nMy first observation was that there is a huge variance between developed countries with similar GDP and life expectancy. Example:\n\n* 2021 Norway - LE: 83.16 years, LEGG: 3,0 years\n* 2021 France - LE: 82.32 years, LEGG: 6,2 years\n\nConclusion:  At least 50% of the gap is not caused by male/female biological differences. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2/\n\nNext, I knew where to find [Eurostat data on causes of death](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/bookmark/fdea070e-a3a2-4f25-9c9e-c79b69eeef19?lang=en) \\- unfortunately only from 2010 - and I filtered out everything mechanical: suicides, assaults, accidents (men suffer 90% of all work related fatal accidents) and drug and alcohol overdoses. The LEGG shrunk significantly:\n\n* 2010 Norway - all LEGG: 4.54 | non-mechanical LEGG: 3,51, decrease by 29.5%\n* 2010 France - all LEGG: 7.14 | non-mechanical LEGG: 6.19, decrease by 15.3%\n\nConclusion: 15% - 30% of the gap is caused by non-biological (preventable) external factors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3/\n\nThen I was curious how much of the LEGG is caused by mortality differences of infants and children so I calculated non-mechanical LEGG at 20 years, as opposed to LEGG at birth. The difference is negligible:\n\n* 2010 Norway - non-mechanical LEGG at birth: 3,51, non-mechanical LEGG at 20: 3.37, difference: 3.8%\n* 2010 France - non-mechanical LEGG at birth: 6.19, non-mechanical LEGG at 20: 6.07, difference: 1.7%\n\nConclusion: The impact of fetus/baby mortality is negligible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4/\n\nNext, I did one more napkin calculation. Assuming that [smoking reduces the life expectancy on average by 10 yers](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/tobacco_related_mortality/index.htm) and smoking rate among French men and women are 0.349 and 0.319 and smoking rate among Norwegian men and women are 0.17 and 0.154, I reduced the LEGG further:\n\n* 2010 Norway - all LEGG: 4.54 | non-mechanical, non-smoking LEGG: 3,35, decrease by 35.7%\n* 2010 France - all LEGG: 7.14 | non-mechanical, non-smoking LEGG: 5.89, decrease by 21.2%\n\nConclusion: Other non-biological factors clearly play a role. [Men famously visit doctors only half as often as women](https://imgflip.com/i/1y06kv). Men lead in drugs and alcohol abuse, men lead in obesity and processed meat consumption. Man also do most paid work so there is work related stress and exposure. \n\nIt should not be a rocket science to isolate these factors. Actually, it would amount to a very cool paper with thousands of citations. So where is this paper?\n\n# The good\n\nApparently I am bad at googling papers - luckily some friends pointed me to some actual research. [This paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00038-018-1097-3) mentions in passing that external causes (accidents, self-harm) caused 21.2% of the LEGG in Sweden in 2014 (my Excel calculation is in the ballpark!). Further studies attribute 75%+ of the LEGG to non-biological factors (e.g., behavior, life style, social roles) (Luy and Wegner-Siegmundt [2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00038-018-1097-3#ref-CR24); Oksuzyan et al. [2008](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00038-018-1097-3#ref-CR29)), with higher mortality risk among men due to smoking, hazardous alcohol consumption, substance abuse and occupational risks (Loef and Walach [2012](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00038-018-1097-3#ref-CR22); Oksuzyan et al. [2008](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00038-018-1097-3#ref-CR29)). A paper [Causes of Male Excess Mortality: Insights from Cloistered Populations](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1519702) examines 11,000 Bavarian monks and nuns living in \"very nearly identical behavioral and environmental conditions\" with nuns having only a \"slight advantage\" in life expectancy. \n\n# The bad and the ugly\n\nSocial and biological mechanisms out there are causing men to lose life equivalent to WW2 every year. We should be creating policies to stop this haemorrhage. We should be targeting men specifically with anti-smoking campaigns while improving their access to preventive health care. \n\nInstead, the UN's quietly manipulates the [Gender Development Index](https://www.themotte.org/post/681/how-un-manipulates-the-gender-development) by removing 5 years from the LEGG, arguing that men living 5 years shorter is justified by biology. The [Global Gender Gap Report](https://www.weforum.org/reports/global-gender-gap-report-2023/) published annually by the World Economic Forum does something similar, arguing that if women live at least 6% longer than men then equality is achieved. \n\nAs a consequence, women is Norway living only 3 years longer than men is interpreted as oppression.",

    "text": "How the field of psychology fails men. (my top 11 reasons based on my personal experiences listed below) I hope this helps those of you in need of help find proper help and I encourage you to share anything you believe will benefit your therapeutic relationship with your provider. **1)** When I was first considering therapy in college, I was look for a straight male.  That was my only criteria and that's when I realized ***we need more men in the field of psychology***. It was extremely difficult to even find straight male therapists with availability let alone a good one. In the end, I end I didn't even end up finding a good straight male therapist. Seeing that [*79%*](https://hwd.health.gov.au/resources/publications/factsheet-alld-psychologists-2017.pdf) of the workforce in psychology is dominated by women, men have very little representation in the field. Considering it's important to find a therapist that you relate to I will also mention we don't know how much of the remaining *21%* of the workforce is a straight guy, gay guy, bisexual man, or trans. I say this to say that a straight man will most likely prefer to talk to a straight man, a gay man will most likely prefer to talk to a gay man and so on for the bisexual and trans community. If you break down the remaining 21% by sexuality straight men are even more underrepresented in the field, yet we make up about [147M](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/11/census-bureau-survey-explores-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity.html) members of American society. ***How can men lean on a resource if we're so underrepresented?*** Seeing that women make up [*76%*](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2011/01/cover-men#:~:text=Data%20from%20APA's%20Center%20for,influx%20of%20women%20as%20well) of newly issued psychology doctorates and [*74%*](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2011/01/cover-men#:~:text=Data%20from%20APA's%20Center%20for,influx%20of%20women%20as%20well) of early career psychologist this isn't going to change any time soon.\n\n**2)** As I dived deeper into therapy I realized **most if not all of the language in therapy isn't inclusive for men**. For example, in therapy I had to read a lot of the literature on boundaries. The language itself was mostly written in third person and used female pronouns. In addition, all the examples of the concepts the literature was communicating only included examples with women. I can't share the literal examples from therapy, but here's a [psychology today article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/tech-support/201906/how-to-recover-from-an-emotionally-unavailable-mother) that displays what I'm explaining. You'll see all the examples are from a females perspective.\n\n**3)** [**The field fails to accept that men feel the same emotions but express them differently.**](https://www.centreformalepsychology.com/male-psychology-magazine-listings/men-wont-clam-up-if-youre-male-friendly-a-brief-guide-to-supporting-mens-mental-health) On many occasions I've been sitting across from a therapist that either had absolutely no emotional intelligence or no idea at all what I was feeling.\n\n**4)** [**Practitioners need to be more cognizant of their anti men and pro female bias.**](https://www.centreformalepsychology.com/male-psychology-magazine-listings/landmark-research-study-finds-clear-evidence-of-pro-women/anti-men-bias) Many practitioners believe in ideals such as toxic masculinity and patriarchal theory which did absolutely nothing for me, it just created an anti men, pro female bias which shined me in a bad light without even knowing me.  This eliminated all psychological safety and made me feel like I had to tip toe around consultations with this particular therapist which is not at all how you're suppose to feel.  The same therapist even dived into the patriarchy in one session and went on to spew some anti white man hate yet he himself was a white man. In therapist that had this anti men, pro women bias I noticed a tendency to project their own negative qualities onto me.  It seemed like they truly believed the anti man hatred and projected how it made them feel about certain aspects of themselves onto me.\n\n**5)** The practitioners I saw basically blamed everything on toxic masculinity. [They need to realize that believing masculinity is bad for you is actually linked to worse mental wellbeing](https://www.centreformalepsychology.com/male-psychology-magazine-listings/toxic-masculinity-is-toxic-terminology). The term itself does nothing for men and actually just labels men. A man who has anger issues for example may be labeled with toxic masculinity, yet this is a trait that anyone can embody, but on one will label a woman with anger issues with toxic masculinity. The label does nothing for men and actually alienates the real issues men may have. A man with anger issues may have very well grown up in an abusive home where his anger once protected him from getting hit or he was neglected and anger was the only emotion heard. Either way, labeling him won't help him overcome that trauma. Very rarely if at all does a man actually portray anger issues because he believes that's what it takes to be a man. **The real issue is much deeper than his idea of a man and is often tied to childhood abuse not masculinity.** (this one bothered me so much i'm going to do an entirely separate post on this and why I think the word toxic masculinity is garbage).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6)** Once I gained a general pulse on how therapist viewed masculinity I decided to stop discussing masculinity with them because for the most part they either viewed it as something negative or knew nothing about it. [**Therapist need to realize that masculinity is great and have more positive views on men.**](https://www.centreformalepsychology.com/male-psychology-magazine-listings/masculinity-isnt-toxic-its-the-tonic-society-needs-an-interview-with-therapist-professor-miles-groth) **Masculinity at its core is great, it's about providing, protecting, having a brotherhood, being a great father, and finding a higher purpose to create positive change in the world.  Gender norms and stigmas actually prevent guys from accomplishing this and embracing true masculinity.** With gender norms providing looks like making the most money, owning a giant house, spoiling your wife, etc, while in reality providing without stereotypes looks like listening, going on dates, and chores, but also making a decent salary.  When it comes to protecting you can protect your spouse in many ways (not just the stereotypical way from physical violence) for example, be on their side in public, don’t undermine their parenting, prepare them for success, have open minded conversations, encourage them to be healthy and more while also meaning you know some form of self defense so you have confidence in defending your wife. I wish practitioners would accept that masculinity is an innate biological drive and feeling not just a guys idea of what a man is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7)** So many therapist had assumptions about stigmas that I embodied which was absurd and basically victim blaming.  **Providers as well as the industry needs to accept that men actually are not the ones perpetuating the stigmas or regressive stereotypes.** Why on earth would we perpetuate something that's hurting us? There's some Ted Talks that I found helpful in explaining this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Steph Slack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3WDw-DBKLA&t=676s) talks about her Uncle's suicide and how stigmas perpetuated **by society not himself** prevented him from reaching out, asking for help, and getting the help he deserved. She acknowledges that society doesn't respond in a supportive way to men in need and also pushes some of the stigmas onto men that prevent them from getting help in their time of need hence why they say you never see it coming when referring to suicide. You can't see something you're not looking for. If you have the stereotypical view of man a a night in shining amour you'll never see him when he's not living up to that unrealistic expectation and he'll be afraid to show you vulnerability because you only see that side of him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Brene Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jtZdSRst94) (a renowned researcher on shame an emotion linked to depression) gives a talk on shame and encourages vulnerability. At the 16:38 mark, she references a conversations she has with a man at a book signing. **\"You see those books you just signed for me and my three daughters, they'd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down. When we reach out and be vulnerable, we get the shit beat out of us and don't tell me it's from the guys and the coaches and the dads because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else\".** This interaction led her to start researching shame in men, something she didn't do prior to this interaction.\n\n**8)** I felt like I had to tip toe around issues that disproportionately affected men and I often wanted to talk about suicide and how big the issue is because I was and still am suffering from depression. **The field needs to recognized that there are issues that disproportionately affect men such as suicide, substance abuse, false rape accusations, the education crisis, male loneliness, parental alienation, porn addiction and many more.** In addition to recognizing it, they need to do something about it. Push the discourse forward and encourage colleagues to specialize in those issues because I've seen so many therapist who claim to have a specialty in [\"mens issues\"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/ny/new-york?category=mens-issues) on Psychology Today but actually know nothing men's issues.  It makes sense how under researched these systemic issues are given that mens issues gets [ no government funding](https://bamindex.org/mn00001-2020-22-ca-commission-funding/) because there still isn't a commission for boys and men. There may be a need for research but based on my experience therapist certainly weren't making an effort to educated or specialize in issues unique to men.\n\n**9)** During my care I was victim blamed on two separate occasions for being in an emotionally abusive relationship with a woman. Some therapist I saw didn't even acknowledge that I was in an emotionally abusive relationship meaning they propped up some of the very social stigmas that hurt men.  **Most if not all practitioners need to stop giving into to a lot of the victim blaming narrative when it comes to mens mental health especially suicide.** Unfortunately, this kind of discourse is everywhere making it easy to pick up.  For example, [the big think](https://bigthink.com/health/why-american-men-suicide/) claims:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*“But counterintuitively, about 60% of American males who died by suicide had no known mental health issues, according to a new study conducted by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and UCLA.”*\n\n**Just because there was no know mental health diagnosis doesn’t mean there wasn’t one. It could however mean that there isn’t anywhere near enough support present to help men.**\n\n*“What’s striking about our study is the conspicuous absence of standard psychiatric markers of suicidality among a large number of males of all ages who die by suicide,” Mark Kaplan, a professor of social welfare at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, said in a statement.\"*\n\n**Just b/c there was an absence of known markers of suicidality doesn’t mean they weren’t present. No one just wakes up and kill’s themselves.**\n\n*“Instead, they found that alcohol and firearms heavily contributed to the deaths of the majority of men who commit suicide.”*\n\n**So alcohol and access to firearms is the problem? Sounds pretty political. Addiction has literally been proven to be linked to trauma, but no mention of the underlying issue. Stricter alcohol consumption laws sure but stricter gun control will literally not solve male depression. Men can find another way. Do you think banning ropes will stop men from hanging themselves?**\n\n*“Poring over data collected between 2016 and 2018 via the CDC’s National Violent Death Reporting System, the researchers found that males without known mental health issues who died by suicide were between 50% and 90% more likely to use a firearm and 20% more likely to have tested positive for alcohol postmortem compared to males with mental health issues who committed suicide. They were also 40% to 50% more likely to have been in a recent argument with a friend or loved one, 30% more likely to have suffered a recent eviction, 60% to 80% more likely to have faced recent legal problems, and 30% to 50% more likely to have relationship problems.”*\n\n**Again no mention of the underlying issue being depression, trauma, ptsd, anxiety, and the lack of care.**\n\n*“While it’s likely that some of the males without known mental health issues were concealing struggles, the study hints at a different explanation for why males commit suicide rather than just poor mental health: Men are more impulsive than women.*\n\n**So now we’re more impulsive than women and b/c of it we just jump to kill ourselves? That makes no sense!**\n\n*“This emotional reactivity, exacerbated by alcohol intake and coupled with much greater access to guns (men are twice as likely than women to own a gun), result in far more males taking their own lives. About 83% of suicide attempts with firearms result in death, by far the most “effective” method.”*\n\n**Again stricter gun control won’t solve the problem, men will just find another way. Better laws on alcohol consumption would make a difference in overall depression for both genders but it also doesn’t attack the underlying issue of lack of proper care for men in mental health. This article clearly avoids the underlying issues men face and victim blames men.**\n\nThere's many other outlets that follow and spread this false victim blaming narrative that therapist subscribe to such as medium and very well mind (very well mind is extremely popular amongst therapist).\n\n* [https://www.verywellmind.com/men-and-suicide-2328492-](https://www.verywellmind.com/men-and-suicide-2328492-) (an online blog who's mission is to prioritizing mental health spreads the same victim blaming narrative as above)\n* [https://www.verywellmind.com/gender-differences-in-suicide-methods-1067508](https://www.verywellmind.com/gender-differences-in-suicide-methods-1067508)\n* [https://judedoyle.medium.com/the-male-loneliness-epidemic-does-not-exist-9c2013daf644](https://judedoyle.medium.com/the-male-loneliness-epidemic-does-not-exist-9c2013daf644) (claims male loneliness is a gun problem not a loneliness problem, basically conflates politics with social issues)\n\n**10)** I'd also add to the list that **therapist need to familiarize themselves with resources that are specifically/only for men like the ones linked below.** I've seen about 6-7 different therapists by now and none of them were familiar with any resources that were dedicated to treating men yet they knew a lot of resources that treated only women. For example, when it came to sexual assault a lot of therapist had referrals for female only support groups like Mount Sinai but none for men. Although there is an actual lack of resources for men, they should make an effort to learn about the few available and perhaps advocate for more. Some examples are:\n\n* [https://menhealing.org/](https://menhealing.org/)\n* [https://veteranfathers.com/](https://veteranfathers.com/)\n* [https://boystomen.org/our-mission/](https://boystomen.org/our-mission/)\n* [https://www.centreformalepsychology.com/](https://www.centreformalepsychology.com/)\n\n**11)** **You can also add that the field itself does face** [**limits to freedom of speech**](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/07-08/free-speech)**,** this does affect the average guy from getting proper treatment because there's a prioritization of care for the LGBTQ community yet, the average guy already isn't getting the treatment he deserves. **There's also a shortage of care on top of men being underrepresented in the field.** [**As of March 2023 160 million Americans live in areas with mental health professional shortages.**](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2023/may/understanding-us-behavioral-health-workforce-shortage) That means more than half of American's can't see a counselor in a timely fashion, yet suicide waits for no one so you can see how that also screws over men. Many of the issues I mentioned are systemic and why the industry needs serious change before it can actually help men.",

    "text": "Partner belittled an accomplishment of mine Posting from my throwaway account because it's too personal.\n\nI've been out of (regular) work for nearly year. Basically, had my first experience of almost being fired, which was fully deserved. I sank into a deep depression during the pandemic which I did not disclose to my employer and when confronted with a probationary performance plan, I realized I couldn't carry on and gave my notice. Although I've struggled with severe depression before, I'd never experienced such an EXTENDED state of despair for multiple reasons; I'd always been able to muscle through before. I'd never just \"given up\" and become so unresponsive; it scared me. Afterwards, I looked at various job listings but my confidence was so shaken that my mind would go blank any time I came close to applying for anything. I moonlit as a freelance editor in the meantime.\n\nI was full of shame that I had worked my way up to a prestigious position only to fail. I was weak and brittle and devoid of any of hope or sense of direction for 6 months. It took forever to let it go. This past spring, I had a burst of inspiration and applied (at the very last minute) to an online doctoral program associated with a great college that several of my cousins had attended in person. After scrambling to send my transcripts and rec letters in time, I waited 2 weeks and was notified of my acceptance. My partner of many years and his mother discouraged me from attending because an online program was not prestigious enough to justify the cost (which I thought was pretty reasonable considering the level of instruction and rigor). It would suck up my time/money and not help my career, supposedly. My partner is a lot older (i.e., has wayyyyy more experience than me) and holds a doctorate in a field somewhat adjacent to mine, so as usual, I assumed he knew better than I did. After a few weeks of pressure, I caved and deferred my admission. \n\nSince I'd worked adjacently with academics for a long time, I decided to take a chance on a goal of mine since grad school - teaching a college class in my field. I was offered a position, spend a few weeks preparing, and finally taught my first ever class as a college lecturer. I'm a pretty casual person and told my students that they can just call me by first name (like my lecturers did when I was in college), but they were particularly sweet and deferential and all called me \"Professor.\" It was really heart-warming but mostly humbling, and made me feel even more committed to doing the best I can. When I told my partner about it, he hit me with this:\n\n\"Wow, \\[insert college name\\] must be real legit that someone who doesn't even have a PhD gets called professor.\"\n\nI was shocked. He had been putting enormous pressure on me to get a job (understandably), and seemed delighted when I got this one. I had never once thought of his behavior as insecure, but when he was explaining to me that since I don't have a PhD, I shouldn't be entitled to that honorific, it really hit me that maybe on some level, he doesn't want me to be his equal. It pissed me off, and I honestly just wanted to bitch about it - I know my audience here don't need an explanation of how it feels to have a man belittle you just so they can feel superior.",

    "text": "I feel Crushed with how Female Pain is treated Have you noticed recently that discussions surrounding mens mental health is talked about in a very caring and empathetic manner? A lot of the headlines are “There is a crisis amongst our men” or “We are failing our men” or my favourite “why the modern men are struggling, why it matters, what we should do about it”.  Their emotions are centered and validated and  is treated like an issue that we ALL need to work on. And I cant help but be jealous when i think about the myriad of ways women’s pain and suffering is dismissed and treated in such cruel ways.\n\nIf you search up about womens depression rates and reasons why women are more depressed then men, there is a lot of subtle blame being placed on us. I read an article recently and they highlighted that women are often depressed because we have “a more ruminative coping style” or that we “are more susceptible to other peoples opinions” pretty much concluding that OUR behavior is what’s causing our depression. I was disgusted by the article because it didn’t even mention the misoginy, bigotry and discrimination we face that surely contributes to our higher depression rates. Have you all run across an article stating boldly “We are failing our women”. I would KILL for that validation that im not crazy and my suffering is valid and real. But nope, we have to deal with the following. \n\nFirstly, I hate how a woman’s pain is considered a fact of life. That I should learn how to deal with the misoginy by now and find a way to accept it. Or that harmful things that affect men like r*pe is more urgent and even worse when it happens to them just because it happens to women more often. It always disgusts me when a man shares his experience with s/a and r*pe and there is an implication by the comments that he’s braver for overcoming it or dealing with that sort of pain simply because he’s a man. Its a slap to the face for all female survivors. Women deserve dignity and safety just as much as men do and no amount of time it happens or history we have with gendered violence will make us more equipped to “handle it better”. People who say “it must be worse for you as a man” disgust me beyond words can say. \n\nAlso, our pain is constantly trivialized and minimized. We aren’t believed when we go to the doctors when we say x is affecting us. This is a HUGE injustice towards women, it’s effectively killing us and we ARENT receiving any help for our real, tangible issues. It is extremely unfair and bigoted that a man can express his concerns to a doctor and be promptly believed and supported but we have to constantly advocate for ourselves, travel the city to find a doctor that cares and will treat us like a human and then deal with condescending disregard from health care practitioners about how are issues arent real at all. How does one overcome something like this? Its absolutely revolting and unfair.\n\nAnd then to continue, there is this implication that women are *allowed* to express emotions and that we are constantly validated and supported unlike men. ummmm in which planet  is this true? Women aren’t supported at all. With every tear that drops, it is treated as evidence that we are overreacting and blowing things out of proportion. And also, when men cry it’s taken much more seriously because men never cry so this has to be a real issue right? This leads us to being more dismissive when women cry because it has to be “just what women do”. When no, we should listen to both genders equally when they express pain . And also what makes people not think that women are not affected by the “crying=weak” trope. Like hello? it doesn’t take much to understand that when men are constantly told that they are weak for crying they are assuming women are weak for crying too or maybe more accurately, women are weak full stop. This affects women. Deeply. Either we internalize we are weak and thus, trivialize all our emotional pain by saying “we are just whining” or “b*tching as usual” or if your anything like me, You cry yourself to sleep every night but wouldn’t dare cry in public or in front of someone else  ever because the last thing you want to hear is victim blaming or looks of pity. \n\nWhich leads me to two other things. Victim blaming is gendered. Whenever something bad happens to women without fail no matter how egregious was the act or how broken she feels, there will always be an element of blame. “What were you wearing”, “why were you walking there at night”, “you shouldn’t have trusted men lol”, “you need to have more self respect and leave your abuser”, “What did you expect??”, “thats just male nature they are wired like that😃”. Its everywhere. non fucking stop. And its taking a HUGE toll on me. Whenever something bad happens to a woman, i cant even bring myself to scroll or engage anymore because without fail, i’ll come across some variation of these comments and the lack of empathy and support pains me to my core for both myself and other women so badly. Its just so sad. \n\nLastly, to build on the “women are overreacting” concept, there is a trope that annoys me like no other trope annoys me. I present to you: “Men are logical and problem solvers”. I cant stand it. When ever womens pain is brought up, without  fail there is some meathead that says “Men are natural problem solvers, so when women just want to vent, men think it through and find solutions. we are wired to fix things”. Omg they need to shove it up their ass. Good luck “solving” systemic misoginy, rape culture, social bias against women, Clinical depression, fear of walking down the streets due to threats of violence, male supremacy doctrines in religion, glass ceiling, pay gap, violence against women, and the weight of pain of subjugation. Like golly, why didn’t i think of that? If they are such “problem solvers” than one would agree that it’s fair to say “solve the male suicide issue problem instead of blaming feminists”. But no actually, that’s not okay. Thats callous and cruel and inconsiderate. So what give you the right to treat women with such  lack of empathy and disregard?  Instead of listening and caring you condescend and provide flimsy “solutions” subtly asserting you think that our problems are trivial and easily “solvable”. Honestly with these sort of attitudes, i’ve refuse to talk about my pain to men , consider that problem solved lol. \n\nAnyways, that pretty much concludes some things i’ve noticed and it has really been affecting me lately . Im scared to talk about my feelings in person  now and i’m not sure this will change anytime soon even though i though i feel isolated.  But I want to tell every women who reads this, that your feelings ARE valid and I care. I understand you. You don’t deserve to feel ANY pain. Im so fucking sorry 💔💔",

    "text": "The History of Somatic Symptom Disorder, AKA \"Hysteria,\" and how it has shaped the medical field, ChatGPT, WebMD, and its effect on women today. This is separated by sections with titles in all caps\n\nHISTORY\n\nFrom the American Psychiatric Foundation: \" Somatic symptom disorder is **diagnosed when a person has a significant focus on physical symptoms, such as pain, weakness or shortness of breath, to a level that results in major distress and/or problems functioning**. The individual has excessive thoughts, feelings and behaviors relating to the physical symptoms.\"\n\nWhich is further defined as: \" **The somatoform disorders are a group of psychiatric disorders that cause unexplained physical symptoms. They include somatization disorder (involving multisystem physical symptoms), undifferentiated somatoform disorder (fewer symptoms than somatization disorder), conversion disorder (voluntary motor or sensory function symptoms), pain disorder (pain with strong psychological involvement), hypochondriasis (fear of having a life-threatening illness or condition), body dysmorphic disorder (preoccupation with a real or imagined physical defect), and somatoform disorder not otherwise specified (used when criteria are not clearly met for one of the other somatoform disorders).** \"\n\nFrom [ScienceDirect.com](https://ScienceDirect.com) article by  R.E. Kendell, in [International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/referencework/9780080430768/international-encyclopedia-of-the-social-and-behavioral-sciences), 2001 \n\nHysteria no longer appears in the DSM-5 Nomenclature but....  \"The term hysteria comes from the Greek word *hystera* for womb, reflecting the belief of ancient Egyptian physicians that the phenomena of the disease were due to ‘wandering of the womb.’ [Hippocrates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/hippocrates) and Galen both accepted this assumption and until the late nineteenth century hysteria remained a disease of women and of the body (generally the nervous system).   The idea that it was a purely [psychological disorder](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/psychological-disorder) dates from Breuer and Freud's [*Studies on Hysteria*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/studies-on-hysteria) in 1896, which led to the psychoanalytic concept of hysteria—the dominant explanatory theory for the next 60 years. The demise of hysteria was due primarily to the fact that the term came to be used in a variety of ways that were only tenuously related: (a) neurological conversion symptoms; (b) psychophysiological reactions—a wider concept of conversion including pain and visceral symptoms; (c) dissociative reactions—fugues and amnesic episodes assumed, after Janet, to be based on dissociation of consciousness; (d) outbreaks of mass, or epidemic, hysteria; (e) Briquet's syndrome—multiple, unexplained, somatic symptoms and persistent invalid behavior; (f) anxiety hysteria—an obsolete psychoanalytic term for phobic anxiety; and (g) a personality type assumed to be particularly susceptible to develop hysterical symptoms. Contemporary understanding of hysterical behavior has been influenced strongly by the sociological concepts of the ‘sick role’ and ‘illness behavior’ and by learning theory, and attempts to reduce both the attractions of the sick role and influences discouraging healthy behavior now have a central role in management. This conceptual model explains the distribution of hysterical behaviors in populations, including the predominance in young women, and many other clinical observations, but it fails to account either for neurological conversion symptoms or for fugues and other dissociative phenomena.\"\n\nBasically what this says is that Hysteria was created in 1900BC and was labeled as the \"wandering womb\" claiming that the uterus would move locations and the SOLUTION to this was... Marriage and sex... Well... Sex really. Coitus.\n\nFrom  K. Pajer, in [Encyclopedia of Stress (Second Edition)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/referencework/9780123739476/encyclopedia-of-stress), 2007:\n\n\"Subsequent centuries brought changes in the definition and hypothesized etiology of hysteria. The definition became quite broad, referring to nearly any symptom of disease that was found more often in women than in men. Etiological explanations continued to focus on uterine pathology but also included causes such as satanic possession.\"\n\nThis means that any sort of disorder or symptom that was found in women but not in men was labeled as \"Hysteria\"\n\nAlso from K. Pajer:\n\n \"The nineteenth century brought a dramatic increase in the incidence of hysteria, although it is not clear why this happened. Treatments continued to focus on the uterus and newly discovered ovaries. The cauterization of the cervix, leeches applied to the cervix and vagina, and the removal of the ovaries were all common treatments that were only moderately successful. In the late nineteenth century, however, [hypnosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/hypnosis) was discovered to be useful for curing some symptoms of hysteria, such as the paralysis described earlier in S.M. Janet, Freud, and others believed that the mechanism of this cure was that hypnosis allowed the [therapist](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/therapists), and then later the patient, to gain access to repressed feelings. In exploring these hidden feelings, buried conflicts could be resolved and the symptoms would disappear. The use of hypnosis diminished as Freud developed the technique of free association with interpretation by the analyst. This technique became the hallmark of psychoanalysis and was eventually used for many psychiatric disorders. \"\n\nSYNTHESIS\n\nFrom a Sociological perspective, one could argue that the cultural idea of  can be dated back to 1900BC. \n\nHere's what I mean. You all know what I mean. The concept of no one listening to you. It's not instinctual for men to be like that. It's cultural and sociological and perpetuates an idea that's based in 1900BC. Men have not listened to women about their health issues since 1900BC, to the point where they created a disorder that can be used as an excuse to not listen.\n\nThe concept of \"Hysteria\" has effected so many women today. The last mental asylum wasn't shut down until 1996 with Bill Clinton. Before these mental asylums were shut down, men could drop their wives or any female relative off, and they would not be allowed to leave until that same person came to remove them. If that person died, you would not be returning to normal society. Many women were born, raised, and died in these mental health asylums until 1996.\n\nSo that being said: let's chat. Here's the topic:\n\nThe concept of \"Hysteria\" has created a long-standing, sociological, cultural, and instinctual mindset towards the attitude of women, what we talk about, do, who we are, how the world sees us, and most importantly: how doctors see us.\n\nThis concept is so deeply bred into our culture that the language perpetuated by it is often seen in so much of our media, and is so deeply ingrained in us. \n\nGoing back to what Freud said, claiming it to be \"(a) neurological conversion symptoms; (b) psychophysiological reactions—a wider concept of conversion including pain and visceral symptoms; (c) dissociative reactions—fugues and amnesic episodes assumed,\"\n\nWHICH: the definition of visceral means very real, and relating to soft internal organ systems like the heart, lungs, and reproductive system. Fugues is loss of awareness usually \"associated with forms of hysteria or epilepsy.\" Or, for better words, when you zone out and aren't aware of things momentarily and briefly forget what's going on.\n\nSo BASICALLY that moment where you can't think about anything because your period is absolutely so painful.\n\nThis is basically saying \"Oh yeah is she is a woman, is having some brain fog, and she's feeling pain- it's not real\" which is an idea created by Ancient Egyptians, then perpetuated by Sigmund Freud, the \"Father of psychoanalysis\" which was then put into the DSM-5 because of him and USED TO ABUSE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WOMEN. \n\nthis is like when you're watching a movie, and there's not a single scene where two women are together and they're NOT talking about a man. \n\nOr when you go to the doctor to get an IUD inserted, and they don't provide any cervical dilaters, painkillers, or anything of the sort, and just go right in like we're back in 1900BC.\n\nOr when you go to the doctor because you're crying in pain, and they won't give you painkillers even though you're 3 years clean from opioid addiction, and your pain levels are reading as an intolerable level.\n\nSo, that moment when you tell your boyfriend that you're upset about something, and he doesn't seem to care. The father who claims his daughter's period to be \"not that bad.\" The old-fashioned mother who won't allow you to bring your bathing suit to the pool party because she knows your on your period and doesn't want you to use a tampon. The husbands who ignore their wives pregnancy pain and tells them to \"Just deal with it, it'll be out in a few months anyway\" and then the wives end up dead because it was really a medical emergency.\n\nSO Sigmund Freud is the reason to blame for why you never get help for your period pains.\n\nAnything that is sexist can probably be related to this social idea. In a world where men don't listen to women, the world was created for them and not for us. \n\nI recommend reading \"Invisible Women\" by  Caroline Criado-Perez. In her book she examines many of the things in America that you wouldn't think would be attributed to sexism. Like how the cities are plowed first instead of the small towns because more men drive to work.\n\nCHATGPT AND WEBMB\n\nIf you go to WebMd and search for conditions, with anything that is both related to the brain (neurological) and pain (neurological/inflammatory/receptors that respond to stimuli/yes fish still feel pain) and your gender is set to female, one of the conditions on that list, usually close to the top, is somatic symptom disorder, which is hysteria.\n\nIf you set the gender to male, it will show up if you include general pain like \"muscle pain\" but it is usually farther down the list. If you provide an array of mixed symptoms, it will usually not show up.\n\nWhy is this an issue? Because when you go to the doctor, chances are when they leave and come back, they're going to google or look up all of your symptoms.\n\nHere's what I got from ChatGPT\n\n \n\nHere's a list of ten possible conditions that could cause pelvic pain, brain fog, and fatigue in a 22-year-old woman:\n\n1. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\n2. Endometriosis\n3. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)\n4. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n5. Fibromyalgia\n6. Hypothyroidism\n7. Depression or anxiety disorders\n8. Iron deficiency anemia\n9. Interstitial cystitis\n10. Urinary tract infection (UTI)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this instance, it labels Depression and Anxiety as \"Mental health conditions like depression and anxiety can cause physical symptoms such as pelvic pain, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating.\"\n\nWhich, is partially true, but to me it seems like the pain, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating would be the thing CAUSING the anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression is a real thing, but most oftentimes, they are comorbid with something else. (Please correct me if I am wrong.)\n\nI did it again, with better more specific results.\n\n\"based on the symptoms you described, here's a list of ten possible conditions that could explain a woman's lower abdominal pain, difficulty concentrating, warm feeling over the uterus, intense cramps, delayed period, and a false pregnancy test result:\n\n1. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): PID is an infection of the reproductive organs that can cause lower abdominal pain, fever, abnormal vaginal discharge, and delayed periods.\n2. Endometriosis: Endometriosis is a condition where the tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside of it. It can cause pelvic pain, cramps, delayed periods, and difficulty concentrating.\n3. Ovarian cysts: Cysts that develop on the ovaries can sometimes cause lower abdominal pain, delayed periods, and discomfort during activities like bending down.\n4. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): PCOS is a hormonal disorder that can cause irregular periods, lower abdominal pain, and difficulty concentrating.\n5. Ectopic pregnancy: Although the pregnancy test was negative, an ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. It can cause lower abdominal pain, delayed periods, and sometimes a warm feeling or discomfort.\n6. Uterine fibroids: Fibroids are noncancerous growths in the uterus that can cause lower abdominal pain, cramps, and delayed periods.\n7. Ovarian torsion: This occurs when an ovary twists, potentially causing severe lower abdominal pain, cramps, and delayed periods.\n8. Gastrointestinal issues: Certain gastrointestinal conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can cause lower abdominal pain and difficulty concentrating.\n9. Stress or anxiety: High levels of stress or anxiety can lead to physical symptoms like abdominal discomfort, delayed periods, and difficulty concentrating.\n10. Hormonal imbalances: Imbalances in hormones such as estrogen and progesterone can affect the menstrual cycle, leading to delayed periods and associated symptoms.\"\n\nThird try, here's the whole conversation:\n\nChatGPT: \"I'm not a doctor, but based on the symptoms you described, here's a list of ten possible conditions that could explain a woman's false pregnancy test, missed period, muscle pain, localized cramps, fatigue, and emotional changes:\n\n1. Pregnancy: While the pregnancy test was false, it's still possible for a woman to be pregnant and have a negative result, especially if the test was taken too early. In some cases, pregnancy symptoms can manifest even with a negative test result.\n2. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): PCOS is a hormonal disorder that can cause irregular periods, muscle pain, and emotional changes.\n3. Uterine fibroids: Fibroids are noncancerous growths in the uterus that can lead to missed periods, muscle pain, and localized cramps.\n4. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS): PMS is a condition that can cause muscle pain, cramps, fatigue, and emotional changes in the days leading up to the menstrual period.\n5. Hormonal imbalances: Imbalances in hormones like estrogen and progesterone can disrupt the menstrual cycle, leading to missed periods, muscle pain, and emotional symptoms.\n6. Thyroid disorders: Conditions such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism can cause hormonal imbalances, leading to missed periods, muscle pain, fatigue, and emotional changes.\n7. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS): CFS is a complex disorder characterized by persistent fatigue that lasts for at least six months and is not relieved by rest. Muscle pain and emotional symptoms can also be present.\n8. Fibromyalgia: Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and emotional changes.\n9. Post-acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS): PAWS can occur after substance addiction recovery and can cause various physical and psychological symptoms, including muscle pain, fatigue, and emotional instability.\n10. Psychological factors: Emotional changes, fatigue, and muscle pain can also be influenced by psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, or depression.\n\nIt's important for her to consult with a healthcare professional who can conduct a thorough evaluation, consider her medical history, and perform appropriate tests to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms.\"\n\nME: But if she is actually having pain, would that really be psychological? Because if she is stressed, wouldn't the pain be causing her stress and anxiety?\n\nChatGPT: \"You're right, pain itself is a physical symptom and should not be dismissed as purely psychological. Stress and anxiety can indeed contribute to the experience of pain, and in some cases, they can amplify or exacerbate physical symptoms.\n\nWhen it comes to pain, it's essential to consider both physical and psychological factors. Stress and anxiety can lead to muscle tension, which may manifest as muscle pain. Additionally, psychological factors can influence how pain is perceived and experienced, affecting an individual's emotional well-being and overall stress levels.\n\nIt's crucial to approach the situation with a holistic perspective. A healthcare professional would take into account the individual's symptoms, medical history, conduct a physical examination, and potentially order additional tests to determine the underlying cause of the pain. They will consider both physical and psychological factors to provide a comprehensive diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\"\n\nME: Aren't you afraid that by including psychological disorders, that you'd be perpetuating the old and misinformed idea of hysteria? \n\nChatGPT: \"I apologize if my previous response gave the impression of perpetuating outdated notions or stigmatizing psychological disorders. It is not my intention to promote such ideas.\n\nIt is important to approach health and well-being from a biopsychosocial perspective, recognizing that physical symptoms can be influenced by various factors, including psychological ones. Mental health is an essential component of overall health, and it is crucial to consider the interconnectedness of physical and psychological well-being.\n\nHowever, it is equally important to emphasize that physical symptoms should not be dismissed or solely attributed to psychological factors without appropriate evaluation. Healthcare professionals aim to provide comprehensive and individualized care, considering all potential causes and utilizing evidence-based practices for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIf you have concerns about the portrayal or understanding of psychological disorders, I encourage you to engage in open dialogue with healthcare professionals and seek information from reputable sources to ensure accurate and compassionate perspectives are shared.\"\n\n.\n\n So, from what I've seen it tells me that ChatGPT is going to be more reliable than googling your symptoms, using WebMD symptom checker, or anything else, and honestly it probably will help you be more successful at determining whether or not you actually need to go to the doctor. And will take into account your symptoms on an equal level. It is probably going to be better at determining comorbid conditions.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nShare with me. Tell me your experiences like this, at ANY time where you felt that someone ignored you, disrespected your body, didn't listen to you when it was important, told you to \"just suck it up\" when you shouldn't. Share with me any time a doctor didn't listen to you or ignored your symptoms. Share with me any time ANYONE discounted how you felt, what you believed, the way you dress/dress/who you are/ANYTHING. If not, share with me what you think, what you have to say. I want to know what everyone has to say.\n\nThis problem of the medical field not listening to women has GOT TO STOP. \n\nTLDR: This misinformation that dates back to 1900BC, which labels \"Hysteria\" to be pain in a major organ system (like the uterus/ovaries) and brain fog (symptom of period pains/PMDD/ADHD/epilepsy/etc. the list goes on) is the head contributor to this social ideology that we live in today, which is present in the workplace, day to day life, in relationships, the medical field, and so much more.",

    "text": "Helene Wecker's books: are both miserable gender-role disasters? (Spoilers for The Golem and the Jinni) This whole post is going to be spoilers for the first book.  TLDR: loved the intro but hated the sexist ending, is that redeemed in the 2nd book?\n\nI just read Helene Wecker's first book, *The Golem and the Jinni*.  The first 4/5 was a fun romp of two different supernatural beings exploring their new lives.  I love slice-of-life epics, especially when they're leavened by something extraordinary.\n\nThe book's conclusion explains that entire premise is centered around a feckless male Jinni.  He's basically a fuckboy, arrogant and mean as a wasp.  He plays with poor tribespeople, seduces women, destroys their lives, starts the book's entire circumstance waterfall, pisses everyone off, endangers a bunch of people, hurts a lot of folks in unforgivable ways, never learns empathy or kindness or sympathy or love, then when he tries to suicide everyone drops what they're doing to save him for no reason I can find.  His personality is somewhere between insufferable ass and outrageously destructive fuckboy.\n\nThat's it.  That's the book's premise.  It's centered around an irredeemable man and his penis.  The golem in the title is basically Wonder Woman: bright, kind, thoughtful, strong, indefatigable, indestructible, self-sufficient, reads minds, speaks all languages, can learn anything, etc etc etc.  Probably could be a polymath, detective, diplomat, scientist, doctor, therapist, explorer, or anything else she put her mind to.  However at the end of the book, she chooses to live an extremely constricted life as a (swearword) baker's helper, re-bound to serve a man and his emotional needs.  What a waste.\n\nSo: two supernatural beings who could be and do anything, choose to be Fratboy and Ignorable Woman, exactly to their worst expected gender roles.\n\nIs the 2nd book, The Hidden Palace, worth reading or is it more of this sexist garbage?",
