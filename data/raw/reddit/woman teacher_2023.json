    "text": "“Straight men believe that they are competing with the top 10% of other men for women’s affection, but really what they’re competing with is the peace that women feel in solitude.” Yeah yeah, I got it from a TikTok but it hit home for me. \n\nEspecially having experienced so many men express *rage* as a result of my lack of interest in them, my unashamed happiness with myself, my polite rejections of their advances. \n\nIt’s still jarring to me that I have said some variation of, “I’m no longer interested in getting to know you anymore, but I genuinely wish you well in your future,” and have had so. many. men. desperately try to shred my self-esteem in response. Majority would tell me how disgusting looking I am. Many have told me I’m a terrible person. One went as far to tell me that my job (as a teacher) doesn’t make a difference in the world and that I should stop teaching altogether. Some have pushed it even further to tell me that my life doesn’t matter, that I deserve bad things, or some veiled threat of how “karma will get me.” So so many of them have told me that they are “above my standards.”\n\nAnd it never fucking dawns on them that **I get to set my standards all by my goddamn self.**\n\nI know not every woman/person finds peace in solitude, but it’s incredibly eye-opening to know how angry some men will get when they see us living in content, or god forbid in joy, by ourselves.\n\nAnd with their rage, they only push us further away...\n\nAnyways, what are your thoughts? Can you relate? Would love to find some connection in this community as I let this quote float around in my brain.\n\nETA: the community really delivered! This was exactly the type of connection and sharing of experiences I was hoping to find. Thanks 🙏",

    "text": "I’m pregnant and my employer is bullying me into quitting \nAhh the joys of pregnancy. Morning sickness, food aversions, and your boss trying to bully you into quitting… wait a minute, that doesn’t sound right.\n\nI found out I was pregnant at 5.5 weeks along, and to a keen eye my symptoms started being noticeable at 7 weeks. By week 8 I had to take the full week off work as I spent most of this time in the bathroom. What kept me going was the silver lining of the first trimester coming to an end. Unfortunately for me my return to work wasn’t as hopeful.\n\nMy boss has always been uptight, and passive aggressive. I described them to my partner as ‘that strict teacher in primary school that never let you feel comfortable’. I didn’t mind their behaviour. As long as you stuck to your deadlines, ensured the day to day operated smoothly, and were willing to jump onto a task not in your job description, you were fine. \n\nIn the workplace I’ve always felt appreciated and respected by my boss and clients. Each monthly performance review was met with praise.\n\nSomewhere around 7 weeks pregnant things started to change. My boss started to give my briefings over the phone, and I was only briefed on a project a day or two before deadline. When I’d complete the task I’d be berated for not doing it correctly, and only then receive a written brief with tasks I had not been allocated over the phone. I brushed it off the first time, but by the 4th time in week I knew something was up. Being pregnant and poor, I was determined to push through. Then things got worse. In team meetings I was singled out, told I preform poorly at my job, and every comment I made was criticised. At a different point in the past two weeks I’ve had every team member reach out to me asking if I was ok. \n\nWhat’s pushing me to my breaking point is now my boss is pushing me to go contracted or casual, which will mean I won’t qualify for paid maternity leave. The worst part of all? My boss is a woman.",

    "text": "A student I don't know interrupted my lecture today to hit on me. Guys, it's been a week. So I teach at a community college in my area, and this week I'm covering classes for another teacher who is out on bereavement.  I'm standing at the front of a lecture hall, clearly lecturing, with a slide deck up on the projector, and some kid (probably early 20s) comes up and stands in the open doorway to the room. \n\nHe stares at me for a minute and then, while I was talking!, tried to speak over me in a loud voice.  I finished my full thought, then turned to the door and said, \"I'm sorry, can I help you?\"  In a polite, but not too sorry voice. \n\nI shit you not, this kid stands before God and man and says, \"I was passing by the room and I heard a beautiful voice coming out of the doorway, and I just had to stop in and see you.\"\n\nThis is not a student of mine.  This is not a friend of mine.  This is a kid half my age interrupting a college lecture to hit on the professor in front of a full lecture hall.\n\nI stared at him hard, shook my head and said in a loud voice, \"No you absolutely did not 'have to.' PLEASE LEAVE.\"  And I turned back to my lecture. He left.\n\nThe class just stared at me appalled, and one young woman got up and shut the door for me.  I used to teach middle school, so I rally pretty quickly from stupid interruptions, but what the hell?!\n\nThis is after I had to call the police on Monday on a different guy peeping in on the ballet class (I've danced my whole life, and the ballet teacher lets me take classes for free as a faculty member).  Friends, there were literal nose marks on the window from where this guy pressed his face up against the glass.  I looked over at the window as I was dancing and he was staring me down so freaking intently I thought his eyes were going to stick to the glass.  I couldn't see his hands.\n\nThen on Tuesday I had to call the police AGAIN on a homeless man who was sleeping in front of the elevator I need for my work and who wouldn't move when my coworker and I asked nicely.  I am empathetic and wish him the best, but you CAN'T just block people from using the equipment at their place of work.  \n\nIt's been a week. What the hell is wrong with men?  I mean I married, work with, and know so many wonderful guys, but what the hell is wrong with these guys who think they are entitled to my time, attention, and space or that I exist for their fucking viewing pleasure?",

    "text": "A little bit upset with the \"lonely, sexless 20's man\" Increasingly, I keep seeing posts, discussions and conversations around the new epidemic of the single, lonely, virgin or sexless man in his 20s'. I see it online, I see it in real life, and I for sure see it on Reddit.\n\nThis discussion bothers and scares me a lot, especially with the rise of anti-women/LGBTQ laws, and increasingly 1950's traditional extremism that's popping up more and more. I'm a 20 year old woman and I feel like whenever the discussion on alienation in your 20's is brought up, it only applies to men. Women cannot be lonely; we all have a ton of friends of course!\n\nBut I'm constantly lonely. I didn't have a support network for most of my life, and all of my friends either are so busy with their own lives, or are fair-weather. It looks like I have 15 or more, but only 3 are close friends, and only 1 will drop everything to come and help if I need help.  I can go weeks without seeing any of my friends; but since I'm a girl, I'm not included in the discussion on alienation. There's alienation where you are by yourself, but what being in a group and realizing that you're only here as long as you play your correct part? I can stick around as long as I'm funny, but if I ask for help with something serious, then I'm a burden. In class, I can't for the life of me make any friends. I had no friends in public school, and I've only made friends outside of my classes in college.\n\nThe thing is, those experiences? It's not limited by my sex or gender at all. It's a very human problem, so why is half of the population excluded from talks about it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course men face different limitations because of the ideas drilled into their heads at a young age, but the outcome is the same. Why don't we talk about women who struggle with being alone and on their own in their 20's?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I think this applies to the sexless part. I'm just going to say the quiet part out loud since I'm so tired of people skirrting around it; the \"solution\" for these sexless young men is for women to have sex with them, and become their gfs, wives, fwb, etc, etc. It feels like a huge backlash against the fact that women are now becoming independent and aren't tied to their husbands by their hands and feet legally, socially, and financially. If we ignore the fact that not only men are facing issues in the most turbulent time of our lives, we can construct a narrative that this is a man exclusive epidemic. Also, why is there such a huge fixation for men to have sex? I don't see this for single, unmarried women for them to go and have sex as much as possible. Sex isn't that big of a deal to not have, and its a bit creepy and sad that men are told that they need to have sex or else they're not manly enough, or that it's a pressing biological urge. My own father said that for young men, it's just different than for women when it comes to sex. That they need it more than women do. Doesn't that sound so sad? Life is so wonderful and lovely, but men have to have sex for it matter? At that point, are they even better than breeding bulls? We're humans, not dumb animals. Why would we expect men to have to behave like that? And where does that put women? If sex for women is different than sex for men, why do we need to give men that? No one is entitled to someone else's body for anything.\n\nAnd this need and drive for sex is ironically, part of the reason that there are so many sexless single men who don't a lot of friends. I don't have a lot of actual friends, but I've been friended just because the person wanted to fuck me. I've had friends try and get me drunk to have sex with them, I've had men who, we got along super well, but they started to get creepy because they didn't want a friend. They wanted to have sex with me. That's so horrid for both parties! I want to be friends with everyone, but if I have to worried that a dude is only getting close to me because of what I can give him, it's heartbreaking.\n\nThis whole discussion is leading to the idea that we need to return to traditional gender roles because men can't function socially or without a sexual partner. But that thinking limits men, and punishes women. In all of these talks, women aren't seen as actual people unlike the men are. I don't see anyone saying, hey, where are all of the lonely women? How are they doing? What's going on with that? I don't see anyone treat them more than sex and socialization dolls for men. And the conversation babies men! It acts like they are no more than dumb animals that need to get their dicks wet and that no one will ever ever like, so they need to lash out; instead of seeing them as actual people!  This whole epidemic of the \"single, sexless 20 year old men\" is just so dehumanizing to both groups. We should talk about men's mental health, but the solution we're coming to is that women aren't suffering and that they need to start fucking these poor guys and become trad wives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Frustrated with the focus on men only in lonely and sexless conversations, and the unspoken idea that women having sex and becoming their S/O's is the only solution, and that women aren't suffering as people either.\n\nEDIT: A lot more people than I thought have read this post, and things I skimped on in detail for personal reasons are becoming a hot topic which bothers me. I've struggled with making friends my whole life; I was bullied in pre-k for God's sake. I wasted a decade of my life alone in my bedroom, not talking to anyone and feeling cut off from society. I tried to make friends following advice from other people, because I know what real loneliness feels like. I got some DMS that didn't think that I did, but I do. I know what it's like to go out to school for 8 hours everyday where people hate you for things you can't change, where they hate you for being award or having mental issues, they hate you for being poor,  and the wear and tear it is it look at a room and know that if they're thinking of you, it's at your expense. I had to leave my first high school because I was being bullied so bad I would wake up vomiting before class. In my second high school, I started to break down mentally at the end. Every week as a senior in high school, I would break down and have to go home. No one cared. None of my teachers thought that there was an issue with me crying and sobbing in my classes so often, none of the new, tentative friends who hadn't been picking on my for their entire school lives cared that I was having mental breakdowns next to them.\n\nI am more akin to a dude in my manners; I do get angry and mean when I'm unhappy. The same things that worked for my male classmates to get help didn't work for me. No one seemed to care that I was so close to losing it all. That's why this whole thing bothers me. There's an idea that women don't really suffer from being alone, that they don't need to contribute to the conversation when it's brought up. I am one of those women who didn't have friends, who everyone thought was ugly because my family couldn't afford decent clothing, and who was mean and jaded because I was treated so badly. When I came to college, I was still so fucking lonely. I did course work, made no friends in my major, and slept an average of 4 hours each night. Even when I started to get this big group of friends, it doesn't really cancel out the lifetime of being isolated, nor does it mean that everyone is close to me. A friend to me is someone who I can hang out with and talk to. Out of that big old group, only one person really gives a shit when I'm in trouble. I don't even ask other people for help because we're not those types of friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know what it's like to literally have no one. I also know what it's like to have lots of people, but too know that if you don't play your part right, you'll be shamed and tossed out. Both are horrible in their ways; like how drowning and burning alive are. The whole point of this post was that this is an issue that is effecting everyone, but is only being applied to young men who don't have sex instead of the wide array of the population.\n\nMen need to have their mental health taken seriously. I never said anywhere that all men deserve to suffer forever; in fact, I think the opposite! Wouldn't it be great if all men didn't have to operate underneath a system that treats them like animals that crave sex, but rather a system that treats them like smart people who can be wonderful, and amazing and alive. We can't make that system fair though in reality without also taking into account how women are treated though. Women are fighting all of the time for so many things - an issue that runs as deep as how society wants us to live together needs both sides not one. If we only care about how men are alone and sexless in an age where our lives are being torn apart, the path forward is one that hurts women and limits what men can be.\n\nEDIT 2: Read the whole damn post before dropping your hot take in regards to what I said. I know that this is Reddit and no one has any reading comprehension, but if you have beef with a point I make very, very early on, you might have the pleasant surprise of an answer that supports the point you want to argue about :D! \n\n&#x200B;",

    "text": "Am I overreacting? Pregnant, and mom keeps insisting I move back to a very red state. Can someone tell me if I am overreacting/pregnancy hormones, or if I had a right to be mad at this?\n\nFor about 5 years, my husband and I lived in Florida. Florida was always a bit red, but we lived there before DeSantis got into office, so it was manageable, especially living in a blue city. Everything went downhill once Desantis was elected. \n\nMy husband and I had a dream from the start of our relationship to move to Colorado, and once Florida politics got worse and worse, we decided to just up and move. Especially since we were starting to talk about having kids. I refused to have children in a state that has no human rights. Plus, as a bisexual, very pro choice woman, it was not the place for me. My husband agreed. The only reason he liked Florida was because of the warm weather, he has some chronic pain ailments and the cold weather makes them worse. \n\nAnyway, I think from the time we moved, my mom held on to a glimmer of hope that I or we would move back. Always dropping little comments that I could move back in with mommy if my marriage doesn't work out (which I would never do). Trying to bait me by sending me photos of the beach saying \"don't you miss this?\" (no. Mountains > oceans. Plus, I can fly two hours to California, have a beach AND human rights! Win win!). Bragging that it's 80 degrees in February in the hopes that I'll say I miss it. This continued even after my husband and I bought a house here, basically showing the long term commitment of staying here. Her argument is because we live in a slightly red area of Colorado, it's \"basically the same\" as Florida and may as well come back. Um, no, it's not. At all. The city leans slight red and is surrounded by blue areas. It's been incessant little comments since we moved in 2021. \n\nThe \"funny\" thing is, my mom is a democrat. She hates Desantis. But, she loves the warm weather. And has, verbatim said \"As much as I disagree with his politics, as a post menopausal, straight white woman, they don't have much of an impact on me\". I like the warm weather too, as does my husband for reasons mentioned above. But human rights matter more to us, so if the cold becomes too much ever, we will move to California. \n\nNow, I'm pregnant. Yay!! This has only made her comments much worse. We don't have any family in this state, BUT my husband and I are both self employed, doing very well financially, and we will both have the ability to be stay at home parents as we set our own schedule and have savings to not work for up to a year. My husband is extremely hands on, and I know he will do everything I do less breastfeeding and birth. I do not underestimate how hard parenting is, but I think I have an advantage being that we can both be stay at home parents, we can afford a post pardum doula, and my husband isn't a loser man child that sees childcare as \"women's work\".\n\nI know this sounds dramatic, but I would literally rather be a single mother in a dingy studio apartment on welfare vs move back to Florida. This is truly how strongly and angry I feel about it. \n\nThe last time my mom made a comment relating to us moving back to Florida, I snapped. I lost it. I told her it's evident that she cares more about selfishly seeing me/her grandkid, then she does them having human rights (especially so if this child is a girl). She cares more about seeing me, than me having rights, and me being in a place that makes me happy. I said it's disgusting how she can care so little about politics that don't directly impact her life, especially as she was a teacher all her life, mostly teaching students of very marginalized backgrounds. I said \"you literally live in the North Korea of the USA and you want me to come back??!\" It was a very heated convo and we haven't spoken in a week. \n\nIf she genuinely and whole heartedly wants to see me and her grandkids more, nothing/no one is stopping her from selling her home and moving to Colorado. But ohhhhh noooo its cold here!!!!!!! It snows here!!!!!!! I don't know anyone there!!!!!!!!!!! It's more expensive!!!!!!!!!! \n\nIs Colorado perfect politically? No, no location is perfect. But I love it here for reasons beyond politics. It is the most scenic and beautiful state I have ever seen. I take two to three hikes a week, and can't wait to do more 14ers once not pregnant. The people here are so much nicer too. Overall, there's very little I don't like here. \n\nAny outside thoughts would be appreciated, but either way, it felt good to get this off my chest.",

    "text": "I just realized a crazy double standard… TLDR:  at the end.\n\nI was talking to a former friend (M46?) who is separated from his wife and “dating” a 20 year old model. Arguing, actually. I was talking about acceptable age gaps and trying to inform him about how women are socialized and culturally conditioned differently than men are, and she might feel obligated to have sex with him even if he wasn’t pressuring her (which he would never do.) And that since she’s so young she hasn’t had any time to see the societal discrepancy and yadda yadda. Anyway, he asked me what I think the age of consent should be if not 18. Like, bruh… missed the point entirely. I hate the idea that, as soon as a girl turns a certain age, then she’s free game. \n\nAnother time we were talking about something that really upset and enraged me. My best friend’s sister, who I’m not fond of and absolutely don’t respect, works as a high school teacher. An 18 year old male student got mad at a 14 year old female student who was teasing him but wouldn’t have sex with him. She had sent him a sexy Snapchat thinking it would just disappear like snaps do, but dude simply recorded the screen on another device and sent it to their entire class as revenge! The school suspended and gave him detention, nothing else. If I was that girl’s parent, I would bring the wrath of *hell* down on that school and that guy! I told my friend that it’s posession and distribution of child pornography to minors and he should be arrested and charged as an adult and go through the legal system. Cuz, you know, that’s what it’s for. My former dude friend was totally against this, student is young, barely an adult, don’t ruin his entire future over this one little mistake… the usual defense of despicable violations of women. My argument was that even if a judge was lenient with him because of his age, actually having to go through the legal process might actually make and impact on him as to how horrible his actions were. \n\nWhy is the male student barely and adult, isn’t mature, didn’t truly understand how fucked up his actions were and the 20 year old he’s dating (19 when they started) is a fully mature woman capable of making mature decisions, etc?\n\nWHY?!? Why is *she* a mature adult and the male student is still just a kid?!?\n\nTLDR: my former friend mid 40s guy thinks the 19-20 year old model he’s dating is a fully mature women but an 18 year old guy who sent a 14 year old girl’s sexy Snapchat to his entire class is just a kid and didn’t really understand what he did was wrong and shouldn’t have charges brought.",

While I have encountered all manner of creeps in my 42 years of life, I've never been this closely associated with one.\n\nI really respected him. I thought he was a great principal. I saw him as a role model. I wanted to be able to approach every situation with his level of kindness and compassion.

I thought he was a good man. I thought he was an example of non-toxic masculinity. I mean, he played D1 college football but was also the kindest middle school principal I have ever worked for.\n\nWhen I first found out about the charges, my mind instantly went to \"It's probably just a vindictive parent.\" That's so fucked up. I can't believe I'm admitting that! Then I thought, \"Well, college football in the 80's definitely resulted in CTE. Maybe he has a brain tumor.

Over the last few days, I've seen a few posts across the Internet about the teacher in the UK who has recently been revealed as having raped a young boy 8 times in the 90s. \n\nSo many women I know who profess publicly to be feminists, to be for equality, to be fighting against sexual assault, have made vile comments about this case. Saying that it can't be assault because 'any young man would jump at the opportunity to f**k a teacher' that it's 'a young lads fantasy' or that 'he probably took advantage of her'.\n\nThis is a adult who raped a child. I know UK law does not define the rape of a boy by a woman as 'rape', but that's what it is. An adult women took advantage of a minor and otherwise reasonable people seem to be determined to paint the child she raped as the likely perpetrator. \n\nFrankly, do better. \n\nIf you stop supporting the victim of rape because the victim was a boy not a girl, that's not feminism. If you make excuses for the pedophile who took advantage of a minor because she's a women, you aren't fighting for equality; you're disgusting. \n\nThe SA of a child isn't something any decent human should be defending, regardless of who the victim is.",

Some grown black man acting like I'm the same size and gender as he is when Im clearly a woman, they threaten me because I'm not kissing their ass or put their hands on me, and if they ever get confronted on the matter by someone else they'll lie and say I made them do it because I was starting drama with them first even though I don't even say anything to these men most of the time. I'm visibly black, darkskinned with kinky hair..I don't use the hair typing system anymore because I feel like it promotes colorism and racism. I feel like that makes matters worse because it seems like it gives colorist black men the green light to be rude as possible to me. \n\nI got tormented by a black male teacher when I was in high school and no one helped me. He hated me for whatever reason and when I got older and started going to practice after school hours he would come up with reasons to torment me. He would call me out in front of everyone, he pushed me, he made up some reason one day to throw everyone's stuff on the floor except his favorite ones and indirectly said it was my fault. \n\nA few days ago this black homeless man with barely any teeth acted like he wanted to fight me because my trash bag had a hole in it and I didn't realize. I live in homeless shelter and im just waiting to be placed into a permanent home. For whatever reason he was helping the maintaince people take out the trash so he saw my bag leaking, i apologized and was literally about to clean my mess up until he started making passive aggressive insults.\n\n When I defended myself he stood by the door trying to scare me..I called him a fucking idiot and started walking away. He said as I was walking away,\" say that again. I was in the army for x amount of years.\" I cursed him out and said he wasn't going to do shit because he would've done it already. I had mace in my pocket but the fact that he was trying to scare me and thought it was a good look for him to try to scare a black woman is insane. I came back out with my mom and she said,\" stop talking to my daughter crazy.\" He said he never said anything to me and that i started bothering him out of nowhere..i started screaming and making a scene, then he walked to his room saying he was going to get his sister to beat our asses. \n\nBefore anyone in here comments that this is a poor person issue I've experienced this similar situation while being in middle class areas the school I went to where the black male teacher was tormenting me was in a middle class area. And I already have a feeling someone is going to say that poor areas have a high rate of violence so I should be expecting this..I have not seen any fight that broke in since I've been in a homeless shelter, and before someone else tells me I need to leave I know I'm leaving I'm just waiting to get permanently placed somewhere else. This wasn't about being in a poor area he was just very eager to do it because I'm a black woman. After that he came out to smile at the hispanic women in the hallway. After that I wanted to cry not because I was scared of him but because I'm I'm sick of being treated this way. \n\nNo matter what I've worn I'm always been treated like a man from men my own race. I was more girly when I was in school and still got pushed and hit by black boys. They would try and justify it somehow all of the time while always leaving the hispanic or more exotic looking girls alone. I used to be all for black empowerment but honestly I'm not anymore. I'm sick of defending black men and boys but they turn around and want to try to break me down and treat me like shit. I've never experienced so much hatred from another group of men..even when I dealt with racist white men they have never tried to act like they were going to hit me.\n\n I'm sick of it..I'm so uncomfortable around my own race of men because of all the stuff they've done and tried to justify doing. I had gotten some help from a few black men but I've gotten way more hostility and anger from them as a collective. And every time a black man acts like he wants to hit me and I'm around other black men they just all stare and don't do shit about it, but later want to talk about being protecters and providers. I told my ex about it and he hasnt said anything (he's black) ,I asked if he was even going to ask if I was okay..no response. He's been texting me obviously wanting to have sex but you can't even pretend to care? \n\nI hope I'm allowed to post this here. I don't really know if I'm allowed because there's other races of women here. I hope this doesn't come across as hate speech. I just feel like misgynoir and violence against women within the black race isn't talked about enough even with these youtube channels I feel like these things aren't getting enough coverage or people just write us off as being bitter. And yes I got referred to a psycharist, but for anxiety. I'm scared of having ptsd on my record but I do think I may have it..I still think about the teacher that bullied me and it happened over 6 years ago.",

    "text": "Imagine if the genders were swapped A boy is wearing a tight shirt in high school. His female teacher stops him and asks him to change; this is backed up by the principal and he is sent home and told to come back when he's wearing looser clothes that don't tempt his teacher. \n\nA man is at a party wearing a tank top, the sides are cut out and you can see his six pack. Later, he tells everyone a woman raped him. They say but wasn't it actually your fault for wearing a shirt that showed off your body? You should have worn something different if you didn't want to be raped, you really were kind of asking for it. \n\nA man is at a pool shirtless. Women walking by begin calling out derogatory terms to him and staring at him, some even approach him, putting a hand on his thigh and getting angry or violent if he does not respond politely. He finally begins responding politely and later is cornered by one of the women. She tells him if he didn't want this then he should have said so earlier. His friends see no problem with this when he tells them and tells the man if he has an issue he should just have covered up. \n\nI just read an AITA post about a woman told to cover up in her own pool that inspired this. These are all obviously insane but this is what most women face their entire fucking lives. If it's not okay if women are doing these things, then it is also equally not okay if men are doing them.",

I am a Family doctor and do meet people of all kinds in my office, but I do not think my far NW location gives me an accurate cross section of my metro area or the world around me. My patients are all ages and genders and orientations.\n\nSo today I went to the Adams Morgan Porchfest. I think porchfests are pretty common in lots of cities and towns ad it is fun to walk around a neighborhood and listen to musicians play and get a look at the crowd.\n\nIn any case, DC is generally a young city and it was energizing to be around so many young people. I was noticing so many of the young people seem to present in non gender conforming ways. I was struck by a tee shirt on a person that said, \"Raise boys and girls the same\". It got me thinking. I was pondering the universe and moving to the rhythm of the music, when something started to make sense to me about the rise of folks who present to the world in an array of gender and style. \n\nIt's all completely clear that this is a generation who is raging against the Patriarchy. The culture wars are about breaking down the established cis het white male dominance of everything. I am 63 years old. In my generation, we were all forced into gender norms that seemed to be cast in stone. When I worked hard to get into the advanced math and science programs both in high school and college, I was told, more than once that I was taking a man's spot and that the only benefit was basically to be good breeding stock for the promising young men I went to school with. (not kidding at all.  My High school chemistry teacher and English teach told me this in front of the class. A professor told me this is a large lecture hall during Genetics class.) My generation helped break the glass in that way. but it was always the Patriarchy and it still is. \n\nWomen can have masculine traits and men can have feminine traits and we do not have to fit neatly into our gender assigned at birth. We don't have to be normative by the rules of patriarchy to any gender or any sexual orientation. we need to break the Patriarchy and they hate it. \n\nYou do not need to be cis, You do not have to be trans. You do not have to be white. You only have to be human and have respect and love for others and for this gorgeous planet we abuse.\n\n/end rant",

    "text": "Im realizing being a girl is dangerous Hey y’all! I just found this subreddit today and I love having a space to talk to other girls since I am a high school senior (17F) who lives exclusively with my dad. \n\nBut to get back on topic, I’m starting to realize how scary it is to be a girl/woman. Since Andrew Tate and other male podcasters have been around, going to school has become a literal nightmare. I’m noticing the aggression most of my male classmates are displaying towards my friends and I and other girls. \n\nOne phrase they love using is:\n\n“Who do you think you’re talking to?” as if they’re threatening/daring us to speak to them… normally?\n\nThey act as if they hold some sort of authority or power over us even though we’re all pretty much the same age. Boys will call some of the female teachers “bitches” and “weirdos” for asking them to do their work while male teachers are often respected or listened to. \n\nI know this isn’t new in any way but with the uprising of abusive and toxic masculinity, I’m noticing how it affects boys/men of my generation and how us girls feel so unsafe going to school now. School has become a total boys club and some girls have honestly opted to do online school. \n\nBtw, I only mentioned a couple cases of this toxic male behavior but I can honestly go on and on and on and on. In my personal experience, a guy in my class asked me out via Instagram and I rejected him. Shortly after, he started detailing how he would rob me, follow me home, and even “joking” about how he would kill me. I’ve told my dad already and we’re going through the Title 9 process now. I might start online school soon.  Being a girl sucks.",

    "text": "What the Hippocratic Oath really says I remember having to recite the Hippocratic Oath during medical school inauguration, and afterwards the phrase \"First Do No Harm\" was probably engrained in our minds as its key ingredient. I'm currently reading *The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian* (Robin Lane Fox), he mentions the Hippocratic Oath in the chapter *The Eastern Greeks* that made me look up its history (I guess I was never curious enough to even wiki it). Apparently the one we recite in modern times is a [revised edition](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/doctors/oath_modern.html) from 1964. \n\nThe original version runs as \n\n>I swear by Apollo Healer, by Asclepius, by Hygieia, by Panacea, and by all the gods and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will carry out, according to my ability and judgment, this oath and this indenture.  \n>  \n>To hold my teacher in this art equal to my own parents; to make him partner in my livelihood; when he is in need of money to share mine with him; to consider his family as my own brothers, and to teach them this art, if they want to learn it, without fee or indenture; to impart precept, oral instruction, and all other instruction to my own sons, the sons of my teacher, and to indentured pupils who have taken the Healer's oath, but to nobody else.  \n>  \n>I will use those dietary regimens which will benefit my patients according to my greatest ability and judgment, and I will do no harm or injustice to them. Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked to do so, nor will I suggest such a course. Similarly I will not give to a woman a pessary to cause abortion. But I will keep pure and holy both my life and my art. I will not use the knife, not even, verily, on sufferers from stone, but I will give place to such as are craftsmen therein.  \n>  \n>Into whatsoever houses I enter, I will enter to help the sick, and I will abstain from all intentional wrong-doing and harm, especially from abusing the bodies of man or woman, bond or free. And whatsoever I shall see or hear in the course of my profession, as well as outside my profession in my intercourse with men, if it be what should not be published abroad, I will never divulge, holding such things to be holy secrets.  \n>  \n>Now if I carry out this oath, and break it not, may I gain for ever reputation among all men for my life and for my art; but if I break it and forswear myself, may the opposite befall me. – Translation by W.H.S. Jones.\n\nHere's what Fox has to say:\n\n>It is probably in the eastern Greek world that we should locate the most widely cited and endorsed of all Greek prose texts: the so-called 'Hippocratic Oath'. Doctors still contest, or appeal to, its principles, but within Greek medicine it was only the 'oath' of a minority of practitioners. There is no reason to ascribe it to the great Hippocrates, the most famous early Greek teacher of medicine who is linked to the east Greek island of Cos. Like Hippocrates himself (probably an early to mid-fifth-century doctor), its date is unknown, but its morals and ideals have been upheld for centuries as a tribute to 'Greek science'. As a 'charter text', what it says is sometimes misrepresented by those who appeal to it. It is even cited in support by those who disapprove of euthanasia. What it actually requires is that doctors swear not to assist poisoners, rather than not to assist those who wish to be helped to die. Most modern doctors still admire the clause against the sexual harassment of patients, women as well as men, although the Greek oath also protected the persons of slaves; most doctors are less keen on the oath not to give a pessary to a woman 'to assist an abortion'. The clauses swearing to share one's livelihood with one's teacher in medicine and not to repeat gossip heard in the course of everyday life, outside professional hours, disqualify even the most admiring modern doctors from the halo of the Hippocratic Oath's observance.",

    "text": "Got told there were \"concerns\" about my wardrobe [EDIT: THANK YOU to all of you wonderful people for the support and kindness! I posted this and then went to bed, and waking up to this amount of comments, the overwhelming majority of which are positive, has brightened my weekend. \n\nOnto the FAQs:\n\n1. No union yet - it's in the works though!\n2. Our county dress code is one line: \"Employees shall dress and conduct themselves in a professional manner.\" That's it. \n3. I'm a C-cup, so fairly average. I will admit to a curvier figure, though. Can't help what my mama gave me!\n4. I always make sure my undergarments cannot be seen through my clothing, and even if there was a chance, I exclusively wear nude-colored undergarments. Also, I exclusively wear my shirts tucked into my trousers/skirts, so the likelihood of skin or undergarments showing when I bend down is extremely limited.\n5. In my department, I am one of five young (mid-late 20s) women. Me and two others look somewhat similar (same hair color/texture, similar height - that kind of thing), and we dress in similar fashions. Nobody else in this group has been approached regarding their clothing. \n6. I, too, am frustrated that the person (or people) raising concerns did not speak to me first. My coworkers and I have been talking about how weird and catty that is, if it turns out that this all comes from fellow teachers.\n\nI will be reaching out to the DH, who really is a wonderful woman and leads our department with fierceness and love, to see if I can wrangle anything else from her. She does not like to \"stir the pot\", so I think that's why she was not forthcoming in the meeting. Speaking of, it really was an off-the-record kind of thing, so I don't believe there have been any formal complaints as yet. Regardless of the professionalism or lack thereof, I do think, deep down, she was trying to help before anything happened. \n\nStill sucks, though, and I can see now the issues with her coming to speak with me.\n\nAgain, thank you all! Have a happy Sunday, and I hope you rest well before the work week begins tomorrow.]\n\n3rd year HS teacher, teaching 10th and 12th grade. Department head came in yesterday during planning, which was the last block of the day for us, and started with, \"This is awkward. I just want to say that you're not in trouble, and I'm doing this now to get ahead of it, because it would be even more awkward if [male admin] or the principal had to talk with you about it. There have been concerns raised about your wardrobe.\" \n\nI immediately felt so embarrassed and ashamed. She explained that it was more than one person, and that she (super helpfully /s) didn't have any specifics. She just told me to \"be more cautious\" when I got dressed in the morning. I don't know who it was that spoke with her, and I really can't figure out WHY they spoke with her.\n\nI'm a woman in my late 20s, I'm very short (barely 5ft.) and people often joke that if I didn't wear my badge I'd look just like a student. Because of this, I dress as professionally (or, as grown-up) as I can. I do not show cleavage, and if I wear a tank top it always follows the \"three-finger rule\" PLUS I always have a cardigan over it. My pants, dresses, and skirts never go above the knee. \n\nMy coworkers and I are at a complete loss over what the issue is. I always make sure I'm dressed appropriately, especially after a very uncomfortable encounter with a male student at the end of my first year teaching. It feels like I'm being targeted, though I'm really not sure why or by whom - other teachers (including the department head) wear dresses above the knee, wear tank tops with no cardigans, etc. I literally have no clue what I am doing wrong, which is made extra frustrating by my boss' inability to explain further what the \"concern\" specifically was. (It seemed like she genuinely didn't know.) \n\nI honestly almost started crying during the meeting and was so glad it happened at the end of the day and week so I could just come home and crawl in bed. My confidence has been deflated, and I feel like I can only show up to work in Victorian garb from now on. \n\nJust needed to vent. Hope y'all have a good weekend!",

One teacher (white woman) was specifically told that she \"doesn't understand the culture of the children (title one school, mostly African American)\" to which she reminded them that she is engaged to a black man and has a mixed race child. They didn't respond to that either and basically the teachers were told if they are ever heard saying it again, they would be fired. \n\nI tried searching this claim and found something about how it's equivalent to telling kids to \"shut up\", but even that seems like a stretch.

If you’re unfamiliar it’s based on the true story of a woman who was left behind on San Nicholas Island off the coast of Southern Ca when her tribe was forcibly removed by mission Padres in the 1800’s. It’s doubtless a compelling story, however, it has some Native American tropes since it was written in 1960.  I teach them the true story of this woman who lived alone for 18 years and we engage in some archaeological investigations based on the redwood box cache found on the Island by the US Navy’s geologists in the Winter of 2009.

I highlight that it was not a benevolent relocation, but a forcible one that resulted in the eradication of an entire culture, and that this story is repeated throughout American History.

She was interviewed last week on Monday and was offered the job on Tuesday. after filling out some preliminary paperwork, she went into the district office to sit down with someone from the district HR on Thursday. after completing this , the HR woman says \"well you're in the system, so you're ready to go! you could even start tomorrow if you'd like !\" to which my girlfriend replies that perhaps it's best if she started Monday. the HR woman agreed and stated she would reach out the middle school and let them know it would be her first day. \n\nflash forward it's sunday, and my girlfriend has not heard a thing about her first day. she has been given no materials, no cirriculum, no protocols, no nothing . she's extremely worried that she is going to be thrown into the classroom for her first day without any of the necessary preparation. i keep telling her that she should refuse to teach, and that it would be beyond shitty of them to throw her into a classroom without any materials or preparation. anyone have any advice for handling this situation ?\n\nEDIT:: forgot to mention that school started two weeks ago. she was a late hire to fill in a position that someone quit and is being covered by a temporary sub.\n\nEdit... Again: This is the girlfriend. I am a recent college graduate from a community education/ family consumer science program. I initially was studying to complete my teaching license during school but switched emphases before graduating. During college I completed a background check and fingerprinting for my state board of education . Fast forward to last week... I have been having trouble finding a job in community education close to where we live. I saw a job posting at a large middle school in a very large district in my state. I decided to apply and was contacted that very same day to set up an interview basically as soon as possible. \n\nI interviewed on Monday and was offered the job on Tuesday. The position I was offered was a late hire position due to the previous teacher leaving as soon as teachers were due to be back in school. I set up an appointment with HR for the earliest possible time, which happened to be Thursday. Since I had my background check and fingerprinting on file with the state board of education, the woman helping me in HR let me know that \"technically\" I could start the next day. Since I had not heard anything from the admin team at the school since my job offer on Tuesday, She recommended Monday as my \"start date\". She then let me know that she would contact the principal and I would hear from them regarding the details of my first day. I didn't hear anything from the school on Thursday, so I attempted to contact both HR and the school on Friday, to no avail. The school and district office are obviously closed during the weekend, and I am feeling somewhat distraught about this Monday start date. I have plenty of teaching experience outside of a K-12 setting. However, I have no access to any sort of New Hire/ mentoring resources the principal assured me while offering me the job. I do not even have access to my district email or canvas. No information has been given to me about what classes I would be teaching, what classroom I will be in, etc. Is this normal? I just have no clue what to expect and am feeling quite panicked at the possibility of walking in Monday to teach a class that I have had zero preparation for in the slightest.",

    "text": "A student proselytized to me, and I need another set of eyes A senior I've known for three years now wrote me a letter about how she feels she won't have fully expressed her love and appreciation if she doesn't share the truth with me. I opened her letter, and my stomach just dropped. She wrote about a time she struggled in her life and how Jesus who died on the cross for us pulled her through. She told me I don't have to believe, but she wanted to witness to me in case it helped. I'm Jewish. She knows this; it's not secret knowledge of any kind. I care about this kid, and I know what she's been taught, but I would feel remiss if I sent her into the world without the understand that a lot of people find being proselytized to troublesome, offensive, and hurtful. I wrote a letter back but haven't given it to her yet. Can you guys lay eyes on this and give me some guidance before I do anything?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDearest \\[student\\], \r  \n\tI’m so happy that you were able to work through that period in your life. Depression is a heavy beast and a weight none of us should have to bear—and certainly not alone. You are such good and kind person, and all I wish for you is the goodness and kindness that you offer to others to come back to you threefold. There are so many handholds we use to pull ourselves through (and sometimes, hopefully, out of!) that fog. For some it is religion, for some it is friendship and family, for some it is hope, for others still it is therapy, and for some it is all four and others. If your religion has been a solace to you, then I am glad. Mine has often been a refuge for me as well. I think our many philosophies are often a guiding light for the lives we wish to lead, and I am always grateful for how many true and real ideas there are in the world that we may always learn from each other. I’ve long been taught, and long believed, that to walk a different path alongside a friend is a powerful thing. To sustain each other as we seek our own truths is selfless kindness, I think.\r  \n\tI can appreciate why you wrote your letter, since I know you wrote it out of care, but I want to gently tell you that to many people (myself included), such a witness is a hurtful thing. It presupposes that a person’s own guiding lights and beliefs are lesser or wrong—I have read some to call it cultural erasure. Proselytizing is a violence at its worst and uncomfortable at its best; it can teach people that they are not safe to be themselves around you. And I know that you of all people do not intend that to be true. I know few people as warm and welcoming as you, and I can tell it even from your last line – that you wanted to offer in case it might help, which is so very true to your nature.\r  \nAs you make these first steps into the world as a burgeoning adult, I want to send you with the lessons from language learning: \r  \n\n\n**The best way to learn is to listen with the intent to understand.**\r  \nIf we listen with the intent to change, we can never understand someone else or genuinely learn from them. We never improve ourselves as people if we try to make everything our language. The multitude of languages in the world gives so much to the richness of it. \r  \n\n\n**People will acquire things appropriate to them, and each person has their own art to how they speak.**\r  \n\\[classmate\\] has words they really like to use; \\[other classmate\\] has his; you have your way of speaking. All are beautiful and good. \r  \n\n\n**You have to be safe to learn, and people learn better by choice.**\r  \nIf you don’t want to be in the classroom and don’t like the class, it will be much harder (if it’s possible at all) to learn the language. If someone comes to you and begins a conversation, signs up for a class, asks to learn, then the choice is theirs and it means something to them.\r  \n\r  \nThese and others I hope will serve you well on your road to come. You’re a good language student and a good person, \\[student\\]. I wish you the blessing of friends from many walks of life who listen deeply to you, and to whom you listen deeply, such that you each can be thoroughly what you are and still take wisdom from each other’s lessons. On Friday night, my family and I will say the blessings over a braided bread which stands for many things. We believe that it represents what the world stands on: study, work, and acts of loving kindness. This week for me, it will also stand for the richer whole that exists when we genuinely allow many different true stories to be told, something I think all people benefit from the beauty of. I'm proud of you and the brave, wise, strong young woman I know you are becoming.  \n\n\n\\[teacher\\]",

    "text": "Being forced to listen to a horrific 911 phone call from Columbine shooting in a faculty meeting I had my first faculty meeting at the high school I am doing my clinical teaching. It was on active shooter preparedness. Two police officers came to give a presentation. \n\nSome parts of the meeting were helpful and informative. I think these kinds of safety focused meetings are necessary. But there was one particular component that I found upsetting and wrong. We had to listen to a several minute 911 call recording of the Columbine shooting. It was the one of the teacher in the library who was panicking. We watched it all the way until you hear, “Oh god he’s at the door” or something like that. The clip ended, and the cop described in detail how she and the students were killed. \n\n\nTo subject a room full of teachers to listen to several excruciating minutes of another teacher and their students moments before being murdered horrifically felt insensitive and unnecessary. School shooting situations are many teachers’ worst nightmare. We have all heard the horrible stories and the news and have imagined what it is like. The point of that video seemed to be to warn teachers not to panic and not repeat the actions of the woman who was killed. I think this point could have been expressed without a room full of teachers having to hear the last moments alive of a fellow teacher in unimaginable distress. \n\nCan you imagine if you were killed trying to protect students in a shooting and “failed” and other people were using audio footage of your death and “failure” to “prove a point”?\n\nSchool shootings are a dreadful epidemic. Many teachers have left the field because of it, and many people are hesitant to pursue teaching for that reason as well. Conversations need to happen about it, and meetings need to be held. However, I do not believe sharing the 911 call was the appropriate way to do that. \n\nI had to sit through this meeting and recording twice. Once at the middle school and once at the high school. The first time, I wanted nothing more than to plug my ears and put my head down. I started counting the tiles on the floor to try to ground myself. The second time, I tried to just dissociate. I left feeling deeply disturbed, upset, and shaken. I should have just stood up and walked out, but I am a brand new student teacher and I was afraid of looking bad or calling attention to myself. \n\nHow is this okay?\n\nEDIT: Wow, I had no idea until some of you commented that the teacher did not die!!! That is literally what the presenters told us.",

I was transferred from a pretty diverse school to a very conservative one. \n\nAt first I enjoyed it. They all did their work.

However, these kids just don’t care. They don’t do their work. They complain if they have to read even 2 pages. They don’t want to do ANYTHING. Emailing home helps at first, but they revert back.

    "text": "The Parent Rant Just a rant. 7th grade teacher. We’re five weeks into the year and send midterm grade home last week. Got this one kid who has a “17.” He’s capable, but doesn’t turn in much work. He’s had some behavioral issues, but his lack of effort and low impacts of his behaviors don’t put him “on the radar.” I’ve had two parent conferences per week during and after school and written up about 30 kids. I’ve also called about 6-7 parents per week.\nWell.. my team got an email from my admin on Friday saying this kid’s mom wants a conference. NP, but we’re all booked this week. Today the kid showed OUT. He was talking about one kid’s weight and another’s body odor. \nI don’t tolerate bullying, so he moved up the list and I called mom on the spare 5 minutes before the after school staff meeting. Total “see you next Thursday.” \nSome choice comments mom makes after I tell her the child’s behavior:\n“It’s five weeks into school and my child is failing, how come you’re just now calling me?” My retort was “you’re the parent, aren’t you checking your child’s grades?”\n“Check my child’s grades?!?!

    "text": "And The Female Students Agreed! Disclaimer: Maybe I'm just old, old fashioned, out of touch, missing some cultural contacts, I don't know.  But I couldn't believe what I heard on Friday.\n\nI am working as a long term sub in a class at a tech center.  The class were the school problem children LAST year and continue on into this year.  I am doing what I can to bring some level of professional conduct/classroom management that I can.  Last full time was not gifted in that area and it shows.\n\nFriday, speaker scheduled.  Successful local small businessman and his female business partner.  He's quite good, very low key but lays it out straight for them.  Generally, attentive to him and when they started getting silly, he called them on it.  I loved him!\n\nAS SOON AS THEY ARE OUT OF THE ROOM,  the guys start hooting and hollering about the woman's looks.  Repeated comments about her \"fine a$$\", commentary on it's shape, size, you get the idea.  I try pulling it back in when I realize the girls are doing the same thing!  \"It's just natural to look at something that fine\"\n\nMy jaw hit the floor.  I began working to get them to re-direct to a different subject (with limited success).  All of this was done at a volume that would be easily heard (if not necessarily the words understood) through the closed classroom door.\n\nSeriously do not know what to do with these people.  The subject matter is nowhere near my areas of \"expertise\", that's a reason for outside speakers, on topic videos, etc.  I'm busting my butt to get them to Monday when the new, qualified teacher arrives.But it's Romper Room in a class filled with seniors, supposedly preparing for a difficult licensing test at the end of the year.\n\nOr is it just me?\n\nEdit - To clarify a few things.  The class in question is a second year class of a two year program.  Hence, all seniors.  It is a barbering class.  I know nothing about the subject, and hair styles play very little part in my personal life.  I get my hair cut 3 or 4 times a year, tops.  Because I do not have a license to cut hair, I am not legally able to teach the cutting part of the course.  So, I have been stuck with the theory/soft skills aspects of the course.  Most of which is review.  There is value to this because students inevitably fail at the theory portion of the licensing tests.  The students are not much impressed, so we have been looking for ways to get them anything related to cutting.  Thus far we have used demonstration videos (from a source they suggested, and is pretty good), and outside speakers.  Those speakers talk about the business end of barbering and can offer demonstrations in person.  In fact, I will be the \"practice dummy\" for a stylist on Tuesday.  Thus, the speakers are not a \"reward\" in any way.  They are an attempt by me and the Tech Center team to offer the best options while the search for a FT teacher went on.  Eliminating them will degrade the educational process while doing nothing (IMO) toward improving classroom behavior.\n\nSecond, I absolutely should have pushed back harder at the time of the behavior.  My only defense is that I was stunned by the level of inappropriateness I heard.  The class had been unruly, but this was several steps above anything I'd seen.  I will also admit that I am worn out from trying to keep up with this class.  I'm not the only one to have worked with them and feel this way.  I inherited this class one week before school.  The previous FT resigned his position two weeks before the first day of class.  There were no lesson plans ready, there had been no inventory of the salon supplies/equipment (which should be done at the end of each year), and it landed in my lap with a thud.  (My admin has a great deal of confidence in me, based on several years of working together, both at the Tech Center and at one of the high schools.  So, I feel a certain level of pressure internally to live up to my \"rep\").  There is another speaker in this class on Tuesday, and the issue will be addressed PRIOR to their arrival.  Admin has spoken to them repeatedly, last year and this year.  \nLast, but not least - I will let the incoming FT know that I will be available to help them as much as I can.  We'll start with a planned two week long \"phase in/phase out\" process.  Beyond that, she'll have me in the building every day (I'm assigned FT to this building), my e-mail, my phone #, and she will be able to call on me as long as she feels the need.",

    "text": "I accidentally took my choir students to a Free Mason Lodge Event. Please help me. Hey all. I’ve never used Reddit before but I need a teachers and parents perspective. I’m a high school choir director. My advanced choir gets hired out in the winter time to sing holiday carols in our community by a lot of alumni. The event we had tonight was set up just like every other one we’ve done but ended with a very weird twist. \n\n\nHere is what I was told by the woman who hired us:\nShe had reached out to the school asking about hiring the choir to perform, and was passed along through our events coordinator. She herself is an alumni, and wanted to hire the group for their party this evening. She told me it would be at the downtown Masonic Lodge, and that she wanted Christmas carols for the season, and that our time slot to sing was from 5PM-5:30PM. She told me the choir would sing at their after-party for some event they were having. She didn’t give me specifics of what type of event but I didn’t think to ask because she implied it was for the holidays. She paid us $200 via check at the school months ago. I asked the students to meet me in front of the building between 4:15 and 4:30 PM. Parents had been told of this event back in September and reminded again a month ago. She told me the kids would sing for 15-20min total with small breaks in-between at their party and be done.\n\nHere is what happened.\nWe showed up outside at 4:30, we went into the lodge, where the woman had us sit in a large rec room, where she asked us to sing 2 carols while they did their quick induction of members ceremony, and then at the party located in the next room after. She showed me where the kids and I could sit, and the piano to use. The kids and I then sat through a type of ceremony that was not only unprecedented, but completely under-exaggerated by the woman who hired us. This ceremony lasted a little over an hour. It was slightly religious in nature, but I made sure to tell the students they were not a part of the ceremony nor did they need to participate in any way. If at any point their safety had been a concern we would have left. But the issues of the night are that A) we were there WAY longer than anticipated, and B) it was never my intention or understanding that the students be present for any type of religiously-affiliated ceremony. Or whatever induction of members ceremony we just witnessed. When the event concluded, we sang 2 more carols in their party and left. I ensured all students were picked up and spoke with any parents that felt concerned about the evening. \n\nI feel tremendously embarrassed and slightly bamboozled myself for the events of this evening. My only intention was to provide this group with a performance and fundraiser opportunity for the holidays. I thought my screening process for these events had already been quite clear and admin was aware that we do these events and they’re on my groups calendar for anyone to find. \n\nI emailed my principal immediately and all he said was “so it sounds like it didn’t go well. Let’s talk soon”\n\nI’m freaking out. Am I going to lose my job?",

    "text": "Why do I have bursts of absolute disgust for my discipline? I am a 30 year old woman doing a postdoc in computational biology (a discipline I chose 8 years ago, when I did my masters). I've been changing topics and found interesting new things to do every year, and learnt a lot. I have been burnt out at times, especially during the PhD, but never had any proper crisis. Some of my colleagues I have liked more than others, sometimes I have been in genuinely fun environments, and have never been in a bad one. At the risk of sounding insufferable, I have rarely (if ever) been truly excited about my work and that of other people, not in the way that I get all giddy when I go to the theatre or to a classical music concert, say.  I  find it baffling when I meet someone who is genuinely excited about their research. Moreover, most of the reward I get from my career has to do with my ego and not my research *per se* (e.g. when people say nice things about me/my research, as the number of citations increases... even when I help someone it's weirdly ego-related!)\n\nI've realised that my decision to go into science has a lot to do with me finding maths easy when I was at highschool and my teachers and parents considering me being smart-ish, quiet and analytical, and everyone seemingly thinking that science was prestigious whereas other things were \"dumb\" in comparison (I was guilty of thinking like this for a very long time! not anymore). Nowadays I am not timid and quiet and even though my analytical side is the one that I exercise the most, I think there is so much more in life that I miss out on daily because in my discipline other things are prioritised: rigour and attention to detail, the elements of life and death seen as objects that (ideally!) can be reduced to some mathematical representation. I find the whole thing dry and uninspiring, and more and more often think that 1. this is not the way I want to spend my days, 2. this view does not represent my view of the world nor the aspects of which which I find most beautiful, 3. it is not really my vocation and there is something else out there for me.)\n\nMy doubt is whether this is a grass-always-greener situation, possibly in conjunction with not having been able to find a truly inspiring environment (despite 8 years in Oxbridge, where everyone is so smart and everything so beautiful!) or if I should listen to myself and this intuition that tells me to get out of here. The idea of working for industry (pharma companies, technological companies) disgusts me too, right now. The longer I stay, the deeper I fall in the science rabbithole, and become less employable in other fields. Has anyone been through anything similar?",

    "text": "Feeling Lost and Don't Know Where To Go Next In My Career? I am a 28 YO woman and I feel lost and kind of hopeless as I'm searching for my place in the world. I feel like it might be too late to discover what I really want to do and what I'm meant to do, but I thought posting here would be a good place to start.\n\nI have a Bachelor's degree from UT Knoxville in Communication Sciences and Disorders. I thought I really wanted to be a Speech Language Pathologist, but with some hindsight, I think I realize that was more my father's dream than anything else. \n\nI grew up in the type of community where women really had two options as far as careers went, you either became a teacher or you became a nurse. I mean zero disrespect to either of these fields, but I never liked kids and I get squeamish easily, so neither of those careers were going to work for me.\n\nAnother crucial bit of context is that I was born with a rare eye disorder and  Autism Spectrum Disorder, in a community where it was better to assimilate to everyone else as opposed to finding your own way to do things. \n\nI made it until my last semester of classes, but I just couldn't make anatomy and physiology adaptable with my vision. Both the school and myself tried really hard, but it just wasn't meant to be I suppose.\n\nThe school knew how hard I tried and they again transferred me over to vocational rehabilitation, because they figured it would suit me because of my passion for individuals with disabilities, however, the program ended up discontinued and now I don't know where to go from here. I don't even know that I was even passionate about it. I am currently working as a researcher on the college campus and next week I am taking a plunge to take a career aptitude test to try to find where I really and truly belong, but I feel a need for some form of guidance.\n\nAll I know for sure about myself is that I love things like public speaking, writing, and researching. I also love college students and want to help them find their place in the world as well. I love the campus I currently am working at and wish to stay here in Carbondale for the foreseeable future. I feel like if put in the right program I can make graduate school work for me, but after two failures I do kind of doubt myself.\n\nI don't have children and don't want them (I'm not rushing to pass down the medical issues) so I'm not worried about family planning on top of a career. I just...I want to feel like I do something worthwhile with my life, not just because someone other than me wants it for me, but I've spent so much of my life trying to do what others want for me that I don't even know who I am meant to be for myself.",

    "text": "What are the paths from traditional high school history teacher to following my heart for international remote work? I have a 14 year career as a high school teacher. In that time I’ve earned two masters degrees, taught English for summers in Beijing, and became a department chair. I thought I was going to be working in traditional American public schools in some capacity until I retired. \n\nThat was the plan until six months ago when I met and fell in love with a woman from the state where I currently work. Her rough family past has made her not want to live her. From that difficult childhood, she experienced much posttraumatic growth, and has built a life where she can work and live anywhere with her job. A few weeks ago, she moved back to Europe, where she already had community from a previous job. Her plans for moving to Europe long pre-dated meeting me. We both want me to move there. \n\nI’m sure some people might be reading and shaking their head, thinking, “dude, you’ve only known her six months, pump your brakes, are you sure you want to walk away from a career to follow her?”\n\nI suppose my answer to that is it’s not all about her. Even if her and I don’t work out (but it would be amazing if we do), after learning about the digital nomad life and thinking I put in 14 long years in an emotionally and mentally demanding job, sweating it out in the American school system, I think it’s time to make this my last school year and follow my heart. This has much to do with her, but it has much more to do with the fact that I’ve been doing the same thing in the same state my entire adult life and I want to do something different. Besides, she’s living in a gorgeous ancient city with great infrastructure on the Mediterranean and I’m living in mid-Atlantic urban sprawl.\n\nWalking away from teaching is an incredibly daunting prospect for me. Thankfully I have enough money saved that I could live at least a year and pay for some amount of retraining without needing to work.\n\nSo, my question is - my only experience is teaching high school history. I’m really good at it. What sort of jobs / certifications / trainings / paths should I look down so that in a year or two I can be working remotely and internationally?",

Thanks in advance to those who read So as the title says I (am 21) male and have been struggling to find the right career for me and don't know what to do, a little background when I was in high school I wanted to go to med school but people told me that I wouldn't be able to make it and I panicked and picked engineering since I was good with maths and as silly as it is I was doing great but felt miserable cause I didn't want to be there so after 2y I changed career tried music as a full career but got cold feet and quit then I decided to choose something related to my original dream of med school I got on a pre-med school course and I loved it. but here's when things got sour you see I wanted to get my degree as quickly as possible because I come from a household of poor income and med school wasn't and option for that since getting the degree in my country takes 6 y plus 2 years of residency so I decided to go to radiology but ended up getting scared of the x rays and it's side effects on the body so the college put xme on nursery school at the beginning I thought i could do it since it was also health related but I realize the hard way that nursing and med school are to different things completely I've also learned that I have a big ego I want to have a job were not only I will be important but were I can have financial security and more specifically we're I can make a good amount of money, which is hard to do on nursing either in my own country Venezuela or the country I want to move to Argentina apparently nurses there are heavily underpaid not only the career my teachers and classmates are straight up awfull with me I'm the only man and you would think is a plus, wrong woman's are hard to deal when they are in group. Most of them are old angry women who want to get they're degrees for only personal satisfaction ( I have no issue with that) so here I am without any idea of what to do quitting or staying and manning up. for those who may ask I live with my mom and eat her food while I'm in this mess, I had a job for two years before the career change but I'm currently unemployed any advice you can give me about my career drama would be greatly appreciated also thanks to everybody who takes the time to read you are gold.",

I've had few job experience: 3 months at a call center in 2018, 1 month managing an intranet from an oil company in 2020, 1.5 year working as a cashier at my uncles supermarket and then 17 days as a door-to-door seller.\nI've tried to study two colleges, one in Computer Science and other in Social Studies, but dropout from both since public universities in Brazil have a hard schedule to match with any regular job. Now I'm studying computer engineering from home since I've got a 100% scholarship in a private university, I'm also studying to be a philosophy teacher at home with bills to pay, however I'm about two months unemployed. I even tried to sell some of my book collection and candy at streets, but to no avail. Nothing seems to work for me in terms of work. I've been applying for many jobs, but companies are not answering anymore. I've been giving particular teaching since 2021, since I enjoy studying many fields, but right now I don't have any student left. I even teach English since here in Brazil most people only speak Portuguese.\nAlso, I married a woman in January, she's 20, she has never worked in life, and only has some business tech degrees and high school degree she finished in 2022, however she is not finding a job either. She's a great artist, by the way. She paints, she draws and make some adornments, but it's hard to find anyone who would like to buy her stuff. She's doing her art for more than 5 years and never got any recognition.\n\nWe don't know what we should do.

    "text": "How to be happy with your career choice? **Bharath (Q5):** Many students are forced by their parents to study something or to do something they are not interested in doing. I have even seen students committing suicide because they were asked to do something which they never liked and as a result they had failed miserably. In that case, should students listen to their parents? In my case though, I was not interested in doing an M.Tech. I still listened to my father and did it. As a result, I have got this divine knowledge from You. You gave me Nikhil sir as my teacher, who helped me understand this knowledge by patiently answering all my questions. So, by listening to my father, even though I did not like what he told me to do, something good happened to me.\n\n**Swami replied:** Parents are always wiser than their children because parents have more worldly knowledge than the children. Worldly knowledge is also a fundamental necessity. Suppose, you are planning to present a devotional drama to the public to develop their devotion to God. To perform the drama, a stage is essential. So, you must have all the knowledge of the stage too. The devotional drama is your spiritual effort. Maintaining yourself in the world i.e. securing your livelihood, is the stage. Worldly knowledge is the knowledge of the stage. If you are very rich and if you are interested in spiritual knowledge, it is good. You need not struggle to maintain yourself in the world. You can only concentrate on the spiritual effort which leads to the permanent welfare of the soul. It is certainly far far more important than merely the welfare of the body. But if you are poor, then as the first step, you should concentrate on the welfare of the body, which is securing your livelihood. **Even if you are a middle class person, you should concentrate on the welfare of the body in the first step. This is because, your limited savings might not be sufficient for your lifetime since the value of money might fall steeply in the future.**\n\nAs regards education, even if you do not have any interest in a subject, you have to develop interest in it since it is helpful for your profession. **You should choose a field of study which has better career prospects so that you may get good employment and develop interest in that field.** Even if a man is forced to marry a certain woman, he must develop interest in his wife, once the marriage has taken place. He married her under inevitable circumstances. If the circumstances had not been inevitable, he could have married the girl he loved very much.\n\n**Similarly, in order to maintain yourself in the world, which is the basic stage for the spiritual effort, you have to study the subject in which you have no natural interest.** After entering in to the subject, you must show your interest in it to the climax. You should not withdraw from the subject saying that you have no natural interest in it. It would be just like saying to your wife that you do not love her because you were forced to marry her under inevitable circumstances! It would be real injustice. Until you are well-settled in life, you must continue your interest in that subject and in the profession related to that subject. Once you are established in your profession, you can pursue your interest in another subject of your choice. But please do not extend this concept to the example of marriage that I gave you. It was only a simile. You cannot say that after getting married, you will also continue your interest in your lover on the side! A simile can be applied to a concept only in a limited manner.\n\n**Shri Nivedhan:** What are all the ways of being happy in life?\n\n**Swami:** You must actually see the other side of the coin. Instead of asking how one can be happy in life, you must ask how the happiness can continue forever. If you take the case of worldly pleasures, the happiness is not continuous and moreover, it ultimately ends in unhappiness alone. Temporary happiness, which finally ends up in sorrow, is not desirable at all! On the other hand, the Gita describes eternal happiness. **It says that the happiness which comes after some initial unhappiness during the stage when one makes efforts, alone is eternal** (*Yattadagre vishamiva*\\*\\*\\*…\\*\\*\\*). You must not only see your need of happiness in the present but also in the future. Some people give importance to their happiness in their old age. They work hard earn and save enough money for their old age. They also take care of their health through good exercise and food habits. These people accept some discomfort in the present, so that they can be happy during their old age. But it is not enough. It is even more important to make efforts to ensure your happiness after death. Merely focusing on your happiness during the temporary period of this life, is not wise.\n\nIf you concentrate on God, you will be happy now, you will be happy in your old age and you will be happy even after death. **God is the best and only way for getting eternal happiness. His grace can be attained through spiritual knowledge and devotion.** You can realize this perfectly once you study spiritual knowledge completely. **You must be very careful in choosing the means of getting temporary happiness or the means of getting permanent happiness.** It is most important to analyze your own goal very very carefully. You must decide whether you are seeking temporary happiness or permanent happiness.",

    "text": "Child at my daughter’s school taken aside for a private discussion for “racism” towards me. Hey everyone, this happened at my daughter’s school this week and I’m kind of uncomfortable with how it went down. Would love to have some insight on this situation.\n\nMy daughter goes to a small school in our town where I volunteer in the library weekly. It’s my favourite day of the week, and I had a great time this week as always reading with and telling stories to the kids, plus getting to spend the day with my daughter. I got there a little early and since no one was in the library, I decided to go and paint with one of the teachers and some of the younger kids.\n\nAs we were painting, one of the little boys, let’s call him Miles, came up to us, pointed at the little bit of lace visible at the front of my wig and loudly said “Fake!” before he and his little brother sat down next to me and started to paint. I rolled my eyes, because kids are gonna be kids, and went back to what I was doing, but the teacher was clearly upset. She told him what he said wasn’t okay and made him apologize, I said it was fine he does that sometimes. She continued to tell me that didn’t make it alright, and started telling me about her experiences with racism growing up as an Indian woman.\n\nFor additional context I know this kid relatively well. I’m friendly with his parents, he’s friends with my daughter, frequently borrows her manga, and will generally come into the library to chat with me on the days I volunteer (translation: to show me his new Pokemon), read with the other kids and flip through whatever book I’m reading (he’s a very advanced reader). A few weeks ago at one of the school’s many events, a bunch of the kids and their parents were eating together and he said that he liked my hair. My daughter’s best friend said that it was fake. The school is very diverse and since a few of the black kids are either from mixed race families or have been adopted into white ones, conversations about my hair are frequent and sometimes the non-black kids join in. He asked what my real hair looked like and I told him that he'd already seen it several times.\n\nBack to the present, one of the other teachers (who was white) came up to me after lunch time and said that he and the other teacher were going to sit down and have a conversation with Miles about what he said and that it was important to talk to kids about racism. I said I didn't think it was necessary, but he continued to talk over me. If you recall my previous post about this school this is the same teacher who had been hitting on me, so I was way too uncomfortable to say as much as I probably should have.\n\nMy perspective on the situation is this. This kid wasn't racially stereotyping me, he has been present for multiple conversations about my hair, so he knew it was fake. He is a kid and is curious about cultural differences which is normal. I think non-black people have a different perspective than black people on what is considered unruly behaviour in a child. I also think non-black people think black hair is some kind of secret and are extremely uncomfortable talking about it or hearing it mentioned. I'm not.\n\nThe little boy is 7 years old. He's not white and comes from Middle Eastern/East Asian background, so there may have been an element of racism to the way the situation was handled towards him. He also made a comment about the first teacher's weight a few minutes after the one about my hair, so I also suspect that she just doesn't like him very much.\n\nAnyway, I'm curious about everyone else's perspective.",

They work in an entry level role below me but I’m assuming they caught the attitude bc they’re trying to go for the open lead role which will put them in my same position. They also like to double check my work like a teacher. \n\nInstance 2: Just today I was in a cross functional meeting with members of a different team. I explained why I thought X was better than Y after he asked for my opinion and I literally got laughed at like I was an idiot. \n\nInstance 3: Colleague on my team tried to sabotage my work multiple times until they got promoted to a different area and now I don’t see them often. Blessing in disguise. They now resort to watching my social media and eavesdropping on me during lunch. \n\nAll of these things make me feel like I don’t belong where I’m at even though I’ve earned it.

    "text": "What is it with older Black men being so patronizing? A number of Black men who are older seem to be patronizing to Black women and occasionally others from this weird place of acting as if they must bestow wisdom...or am I trippin? I've noticed this in observing how they try to flirt with women, how they try to teach, and how they interpret other's information erroneously as if looking for something to teach, challenge, or correct. Like...did someone just issue a decree that every Black man has to be a more annoying bagger vance once they're over 40?  \n\n\nI've had male therapists before and all of my therapists have been nice lovely people. However, the Black male therapist I have is...patronizing and often fails to fully grasp where I'm coming from in a way that transcends my having ADHD and rapid fire thoughts. To be blunt, as a therapist being on the receiving end is oddly fascinating. He simultaneously respects my knowledge and I'm encountering an attitude I've experienced specifically the most from older Black men which is a certain level of *let me explain the world to you* combined with this feeling of they're *doing me a kindness*. I am a therapist. I get there's an unavoidable explanatory quality sometimes. But every fucking session I feel like I'm back in high school listening to a particularly great, but deeply annoying Black male teacher who very clearly bought into this attitude. \n\nIt's a sexism problem on one hand, and I've experienced similar with white folks, but they don't do it with this sense of familiarity or attempted \"I'm helping you out by doubting you/talking down to you while simultaneously demanding you meet a certain level\". Or at least it doesn't feel that way, in fact of white folk it seems I get that attitude from the most is white women/afabs, which I think is striking. It is as though because they feel a kinship they don't think they can be perceived as anything other than helpful despite their tone/attitude. The result is me walking away feeling older Black men tend to perceive themselves as sages of the community instead of fully authentically just listening especially to Black women. I suspect they think Black women won't let them get a word in edgewise(...which is less to do with being Black and a woman with me, but more with my ADHD . \n\nOverall while this attitude can be present in other populations and individuals, but this feels so common and uniquely accepted as how Black men of a certain age should be. It appears different than older white dudes who are \\*similar\\*, but generally don't have a sense of that over familiarity/arrogance until they know you well or unless they feel like they know Black folk as a group well (barf). Maybe that's the core, when people feel they understand someone they perceive as less experienced/lesser/in need of wisdom then they don't feel the need to check how they convey information NOR question if they actually understood the information shared with them. They assume they're being the wise mentor, the kindly sage, the Bagger Vance and with Black women it feels so...automatic in the interactions with older Black men. Even men who've tried to flirt with me have on occasion come at me like I don't know what I want, what I'm doing, or as if I need guidance. Meanwhile certain Black men come into the room like they know you especially if you're Black. **It's not about their language, code switching, but about their tone and approach that feels like being put at a distance intellectually while fronting like there's a closeness they uniquely have due to their supposed understanding and wisdom**. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel bad critiquing one of our own when our field needs Black men so badly, but these older dudes stay with this attempted sagely behavior without listening to what a Black woman is saying and he recognized I got defensive because it sounded like he was judging my professionalism without actually grasping the concepts I was explaining. **Am I overgeneralizing to an insane degree? Is this a cultural norm or behavior you've witnessed. Am I codifying race into something rooted in sexism?**",

Enjoy! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe camera pans in on a class of 2nd graders. The teacher is a black woman with an afro pulled into a puff.

At the end, DEM franchise boyz come down the line leaning/rocking and the students all run away screaming \"Who is that?\" because of the generational divide. \n\nThe End.",

I had a black man leave a negative review for my business because I was attending to paying white customers at the farmers market instead of holding up the line and taking time out to entertain him with random conversation. At the end of his rant was \"what you expect from black businesses.\" I had to appeal that bs review for almost a month before it was taken down. \n\nI don't hide it if asked but sometimes I find myself really hoping no one asks. After being asked, I've randomly been asked for skinfolk discounts, had my prices questioned or sometimes I've just had a nice black woman state that she would've supported sooner if she knew it were black owned, which is nice and I appreciate it but it doesn't feel necessary? Out of my friends group I'd say almost half of us are business/side business owners, mostly black women, and none of us advertise our businesses as black owned except for one. The one that does, that's just so it's easier to be identified for grant qualifications.\n\nSo do you advertise and market your business/side business as black owned? What do you think are the real pros and cons of either choice?",

    "text": "Teaching English Overseas... Experience? How to? Hello,\n\nSo I'm in another part of my quarter life crisis, and I was wondering if anyone here had any experience teaching English overseas. For some background I'm Canadian, 25f, and I have a Bachelors Degree in English. Initially, the plan was for me to graduate and go to teach in Japan (as part of the JET program), but COVID happened and I lost my nerve. Now it's 2 years since graduation and I'm wondering if I should still look into teaching English overseas. It doesn't have to be Japan; I've also been eyeing China, the Arab world, and South America.\n\nIf anyone has any experience, pointers, tips or warnings, it's very welcome! I'd get a TESL sometime next year, and then probably be 'ready to leave' sometime in 2025. Some preliminary questions are:\n\n1. What sort of experience do you need to teach? Do you need to have been a teacher?\n2. Which countries would be the safest for a Black Queer woman to teach in? I think I could probably hide my queerness for a time but I couldn't hide that I'm Black (obviously lol).\n3. How is the pay? Is it enough to survive comfortably in said country? I come from a poor background.\n4. How long can you stay, and for those who have left/come back, how was the process of reintegrating into Western Society?\n\nThanks in advance! :)",

    "text": "My Friend Said the N Word, Seeking Advice I’m currently a senior in high school. We are reading a play called Fences and have volunteers playing a role. Throughout the play, we view the lives of a black family and their situation in the 1950’s. It was very much chosen by our teacher to learn about racism and other literary stuff common to English classes. \n\nGetting back to the point, my friend volunteered to play the role of a black man, who is the only other person saying the n-word  besides the main character (who is played by a black dude). Well, the only time the character says the word, he chose to say it and my teacher did nothing to reprimand him. I try to tread lightly with throwing around the word racist, I’m not sure if i’m valid in just believing that it was truly misguided as my counselor told me. With other black students wanting nothing to do with the situation, I want a conversation about it with my class. I feel like i am in the minority (and it hurts) since i don’t have the same views as my fellow black women in the grade.\n\nI was the only one that demanded an explanation after the fact (Out of the 6 black students, 2 of us were vocal about being upset) and was told that he understood how his actions affected us, and that he will be making an apology. I did tell him i was pissed, offended, and am not accepting the apology because nothing will ever change the fact that he thought it was okay to say the slur. But he is on the spectrum and genuinely cannot take social cues. I am not trying to make a excuse for him, because there is none, but with people making jokes about him, I don’t feel alright without letting them know that even while this is a horrible situation, I hope no one feels any hatred. \n\nI did have a conversation with my teacher and another black student, and I basically told him that i lost his trust and how I now feel very unsafe in this environment and it wasn’t my place to handle the situation. I also said that while we are having a dialogue about it tomorrow (that i asked for) nothing will change how it was initially handled. How should I proceed with the discussion taking place? I don’t want to make any excuses or accept any apology, but i just want the jokes about my friend and “how they would’ve handled it” to end because apparently this is a funny situation to my peers. I don’t want to be labelled as an angry black woman again or not truly black, so where should I go with this?",

I’m 10000% known in the school (in a good way), and so is he.\n\nSchool starts again. \n\nNow see we broke up in June about a week before school ended, and I shared to my Instagram that we’re no longer together. Now see the issue falls onto the fact that not *everyone* has my instagram, teachers too.\n\nSo when I come back to school, a good amount of people still think we’re together.\n\nHowever I began to notice that my best friend was hanging out with my ex a lot more, so much so she stopped hanging out with the girls like she always did. (I mentioned more about this in another post on this subreddit).\n\nI ask my ex’s best friend considering we both hold the moral of not trying to get with each other respect of the other friend (in this case my ex).\n\nSo I asked him if he noticed, and he in fact did, as well as plenty of other people who not only asked me, but ask him as well. They found it extremely weird, also considering some staff and students still think we’re dating.\n\nI’m not jealous, let alone want him back. I truthfully feel angry and betrayed.

So I think the added audacity for someone to linger with another black woman after crossing the last one’s boundary with politics and such is not only disrespectful to me, but my ex best friend. \n\nIf something does happen, I got a year left of this shit.

    "text": "Family court is absolutely stacked against men. A personal story. When I was 19 years old I made the mistake of marrying the wrong woman. Soon after getting married she was pregnant and gave birth to our son. Shortly after we divorced. The reason for the divorce was that she needed her independence. Apparently financially providing for somebody for multiple years while expecting absolutely nothing of them is abusive. But all that's for different sub. The divorce was uncontested, and rather amicable. Despite her cooperation, the squadron of lawyers and many hours of filings and paperwork I came out of court with a verdict that was, at best, tolerable. Now you might be wondering why we even went to court if we agreed so much on the divorce. That's because in the state of Georgia if a married couple has a child they must go to court to get a divorce and there must be a child custody plan on court order. And there must be an order for child support. \n\nDespite the fact that I raised my son from infancy by working night shifts, and my ex-wife both wanted nothing to do with the child nor did she help in any way, the best I got from the court was joint 50/50 custody. The caveat to that was even with joint custody one parent is awarded the title of primary, and the non-primary parent had to pay the primary parent child support. By default and impossibly to change my ex-wife was awarded primary. Even though I had paid for her to start her own company that did not pull in any revenue, since she had no income, my monthly child support payment was set at $1,000.\n\nYears pass and everything is fine. I pay my child support on time. I see my kid every other week for a full week. Eventually I remarry. With much more experience and dating and partnerships, I actually found myself in the company of a fantastic woman. She had been raped a little over a year ago and decide to keep the child, so when I married her I formerly adopted her 6-month-old son. Everything was going well, my new wife was even expecting a new baby. I was excited to finally have a second chance at a proper family. And then, as life likes to do, shit hit the fan. In September of last year, my colon ruptured. This led to immediate surgery, where they remove all your organs clean as much of the shit out of your body cavity as they can and put your organs back. I was in an ostomy bag though it was expected to be reversed in the coming months. I suffered multiple infections and follow up surgeries. During this time my very pregnant wife ended up falling down a single stair and breaking her foot. With both of us being varying levels of medically compromised, we made the difficult decision to place her son with her mother and my son with my father until we both recovered.\n\nDuring this time, CPS was called to our house, the accusation being that my home was uninhabitable due to the mess that had accumulated. And while it is true that my home was unfit for children, we had already come to that conclusion and removed the children from the home. Upon informing CPS of this, they immediately dropped the case. Because of the amicable nature and cooperation after our divorce, I didn't think my ex-wife was the one who called, however, given my mother was already suing me for grandparents rights, I was pretty confident and it took very little persuading by my ex-wife that my mother was the one who made call.\n\nDecember ends and I have my final surgery. My bowel is reconstructed, I no longer shit in the bag, my wife's foot is healed and I'm ready to return to work. However, FMLA only protects your job for measly 12 weeks. So I returned to work to find that I was not employed. Scrambling, I used my networking to get a job as quick as possible, however this job was out of state. Not far, in North Carolina about 3 hours away. But obviously I would have to move to work there. I take the job pack up the wife and kids , and move up there. I didn't have time to sell the house so I rented it at cost for my mortgage, and we rented a new house near my new job. Everything was going well and spring break was approaching. I had made new agreements with my ex-wife in terms of time with my son. This new agreement fell well within the confines of our previous court order for custody. Instead of the whole week every other week I would simply come down on weekends and hang out with my son at my dad's place. And then I would have him for spring break and summer break. I intended, since my ex-wife was now a teacher, to renegotiate custody to where I keep him full time in North Carolina and she has him over the summer and all weekends. If you do the math on that she'd have more actual time with him but it would prevent him from having to go to daycare as my wife is a stay-at-home wife. Spring break comes and goes, my son and I have a great time and I even bought him a tortoise. But this is where the trouble begins.\n\nOn the last few days of spring break, my ex-wife asks if she can have my son early to take him to her mother's musical performance. I personally don't believe my 5-year-old son would enjoy listening to a sultry old fart play the piano for a couple hours, but like a good parent I ask him what he would prefer. He declines to go with my ex and instead wants to spend his last day with me. The next day my wife comes and collects him and they go back down to Georgia.\n\nMy next weekend is coming up and I'm coordinating with my ex to pick up my son. She informs me that because I have not yet paid child support, she's not going to allow me to see him. Even if I hadn't paid child support, you can't withhold court ordered visitation for any reason. The Idiocracy of her statement is the fact that I hadn't yet paid child support for the month that we were currently in. I had until the end of the month to pay it and as the end of the month was my next paycheck that's when I told her I would. This went on for the next couple of months, her using the same excuse, and me not getting to see my son. My only reprieve is that the court order states that I have the right to call my son and speak to him on the phone at any reasonable hour. So at least I still got to hear from him. That is until the summer was coming up. I finally had the funds to start paying child support in advance to get rid of her stupid excuse, I had done so and texted her to request my son that weekend and coordinate summer drop off. This is when she informs me that she will no longer be abiding by that agreement and I will not be seeing my son for the foreseeable future.\n\n\nMy only recourse to this is to go to the court and file a motion for contempt of court where they can give her a court order to obey the court order that she's already not obeying. Wow. Of course this costs money, you need a lawyer and a hearing. But it's my only recourse and so I was preparing to do so. However, before I got the chance CPS was once again called to my household. However, my ex-wife was the only person who knew my new address. This made me realize that it was My ex who was calling CPS the entire time. CPS again came and went finding nothing wrong. But now I was livid. As I squared up to start my motion with the court I had another bomb dropped on me. My ex would no longer answer any of my phone calls and I could not speak to my son. And then, as icing on the shit cake, I got slapped with a temporary restraining order. The charge? Harassment. My crime? Calling and texting her every day.\n\n\nThere were a couple legal issues with this TPO and it's the main purpose for my post here today. What I've gone through highlights the intrinsic bias of the system against men in particular fathers.\n\nTo start, the TPO was signed and issued in Walton county, Georgia. I live in and had at no point left North Carolina. I was not subject to the jurisdiction of Walton county. The TPO was erroneously written from the first page. Section two of the TPO literally outlines jurisdiction in which you have to sign an affidavit stating that I live in \"blank address, Walton county.\"  To which they wrote that I lived in 123 fake road name, city, North Carolina, Walton county, Georgia.\n\nMy petitions for a change of venue due to the lack of jurisdiction were summary dismissed. I then asked for a dismissal based on the grounds that the alleged crime violated a pre-existing court order stating I had the right to do what I did. Again, rejected. Unfortunately, my wife was coming to the end of a very complicated pregnancy and was scheduled for a 39 week induction. This cannot be moved up for the baby's health and it cannot be delayed for my wife's health. Her induction is the same date as my court date. As much as I did not want to prolong my inability to contact my son, I motioned for an extension on the grounds that my wife would be giving birth that day. Again rejected. I figured the issue was the fact that I was trying to represent myself pro se in all these motions, so I scraped together enough cash to get a lawyer. She submitted everything I had mentioned above again. If all else failed I could at least have the lawyer go in on my behalf so that I could be with my wife during her labor. not only was all of it rejected, the lawyer informed me that she would not be allowed to represent me in this case and the judge told her that he \"better see my ass on that bench the day of court.\" \n\nDid I mention that the district attorney for Walton county is the one who filled out the civil TPO petition? Because guess who was representing my ex-wife at my court date. I then proceeded to get absolutely railroaded in this hearing. Not only did they decide to enforce the TPO preventing me from contacting my ex-wife or child. The judge went beyond the scope of the hearing to amend my custody agreement to in I have no visitation rights whatsoever.\n\nSo now I have a son that I never get to see,and  a woman I have to pay $1,000 a month to for the privilege. And no prospects for changing the situation.",

    "text": "Male privilege is a myth in Muslim countries, too, and here's why: **Afghanistan**\n\n*Trafficking*\n\nWell here's an interesting fact: [boys are more likely in Afghanistan to be trafficked than girls](https://hagarinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hagar-Research-Forgotten-No-More-Male-Child-Trafficking-in-Afghanistan.pdf). They can be subjected to sexual trafficking, forced labor or being sent off as a soldier (a loophole due to the country's absence of conscription). For example, boys often age 13 and under often were sexually trafficked into Bacha Bazi or \"boy play\", which was a custom where young boys were forced into entertainment where they danced or sang sexually as male entertainers for adult men and were raped repeatedly by their captors and his friends. At least 50 percent of sexual exploitation in Afghanistan was bacha bazi, and it often crossed lines into forced labor. Boys age 13 and under were most likely to be sexually exploited, and because Afghan girls were banned from sexual work and entertainment because they were seen as child-bearers and homemakers, [Afghan boys were picked as a substitute for sexual gratification](https://76crimes.com/2021/10/21/sex-trafficking-of-boys-contributed-to-taliban-victory-in-afghanistan/), being seen as a substitute for women. As a result, the people raping them saw them as a fake woman and didn't consider themselves gay for raping them. Taliban opposed Bacha Bazi but American-backed Afghan leaders practiced it and American forces ignored it. This led to support towards Taliban from families of victims and others opposed to the practice. The boys were made to dress in feminine attire and were released as soon as they grew beards. Many powerful Afghan men supported the practice because they believed women are for children and boys are for sexual gratification.\n\nBoys are more likely to be trafficked in Afghanistan than girls, as mentioned above, and often forced into forced labor or being a soldier, with young men ages 14 to 18 often being forced as soldiers or forced labor. Many soldiers were forced to become suicide bombers and young men put in forced labor worked in mines, worked in the streets or assistant truck driving.\n\n*Crime victimization and abuse*\n\n[Physical abuse and corporal punishment is common for Afghan kids](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220614&type=printable). Except for baseline, boys were more likely than girls to experience physical punishment at home. Boys were also more likely than girls to experience peer violence victimization. Boys also scored higher than girls on depression, but often admittedly scored slightly higher on hope. Schools and teachers also inflicted corporal punishment and violence, particularly on boys. 100% of boy schools and only 20% of girl schools involved physical punishment from teachers. The same study found high rates of sexual abuse, including rape, of boys at schools, often by male teachers and older boys. When it comes to physical abuse, mothers often can be aggressors. In a [study](https://www.whatworks.co.za/documents/publications/424-ndungu-et-al-gibbs-2021-afghan-child-punishment-sem-15122021/file), 71.8% of married women admitted to physically abusing their children, and a little less than half said their partner also did so, which means many times, their partner, presumably a husband, did not do so. [In a study of physical abuse of children in Afghanistan](https://areu.org.af/wp-content/areu_publications/2016/01/804E-Love-Fear-and-Discipline-IP-print.pdf.pdf), men were more likely to believe boys got more physically disciplined, possibly due to probably experiencing it themselves or due to boys being perceived as potentially troublemakers. Women believed girls were beaten more, and women reported higher levels of violence directed towards girls because men might be unaware of violence mothers inflict on girls in the house.\n\n*Murder/homicide*\n\nIn Afghanistan, [87% of homicide victims are men](http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/data/GSH2013_Sex_data.xlsx). [In fact](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/9/10/it-is-time-we-remember-afghan-men-are-also-victims-of-this-war), Afghan men and boys were killed all the time and American media only focused on the women and children, portraying Afghan men as sexist oppressors, but these men are usually victims instead. Due to media portraying Afghan men as evil misogynistic terrorists, the American military killed many male Afghan civilians and assumed they were terrorists. The media used feminist language (even the right-wing media did this) to portray women there as damsels in distress in need to help but not due to care for the women there, but to influence Americans into supporting the war against Afghanistan. America's war created so many political and economic issues, it made Afghanistan even more dangerous and violent for women and even for men. In fact, the US military only helped solely women who claimed to be harmed by Taliban, so many women lied and said the Taliban hurt them to get US aid from the US military. Most American soldiers, just like their political leaders or generals, did not distinguish between Afghan male civilians and Taliban fighters, and thus killed many male civilians. They often were unlawfully imprisoned, tortured and killed by the US military despite being civilians. Often mistaken as security threats instead of civilians, these men were killed either by the US military or by Taliban. According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, between January 2004 and February 2020, the US conducted at least 13,072 drone attacks in Afghanistan, killing 4126 to 10,076 people. 300 to 909 of those killed are believed to have been civilians. It's impossible to know how many were really civilians, because the US did everything to obscure this number. As the New York Times [explained](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html) in 2012, for example, the Obama administration counted “all military-age males \\[killed\\] in a strike zone as combatants … unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent.” “Counterterrorism officials,” the Times article went on to say, “insist this approach is one of simple logic: people in an area of known terrorist activity, or found with a top Qaeda operative, are probably up to no good.” Thus, many Afghan men who were civilians were killed by being guilty by association. They lived in Afghanistan in areas the US attacked, being labeled as automatically terrorists by default.\n\n[In fact](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/07/1096382), the media emphasizes women and children in Afghanistan who are wounded or killed, when adult men are the most likely to have been killed. In Afghanistan, of all civilian casualties, 32% were women and 14% were children. This means 54% were men. Men were the most likely to be casualties, more so than women and more so than children. Not to mention some these children are presumably boys. The media emphasizes exclusively the women and children who are killed.\n\n*Taliban's treatment of boys*\n\n[Taliban have turned so many young boys into soldiers](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/09/20/our-opportunity-end-talibans-use-child-soldiers). Boys as young as 6 are indoctrinated, and by age 13, learned how to use firearms. By their teenage years they were required to fight. The US-backed Afghan government and pro-government forces also recruited and used young boys. Taliban also used these boys to carry out suicides and other violent attacks, recruiting them through deception, promises of money or other incentives, or even threats. Taliban and other armed forces used young boys many times to carry out suicide bombings because they thought they could manipulate them more easily and might be less suspicious than adults. The US-backed former Afghan government and other pro-government forces also recruited young boys as recruitment and using them to fight. [Taliban used many young boys even as young as age 7 as suicide bombers](https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/08/31/afghanistan-taliban-should-stop-using-children-suicide-bombers), telling them lies like they would survive the bombing themselves if they were an amulet with Quran verses on it. Boys as young as 11 were also recruited by Taliban to carry out activities like smuggling weapons across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, planting explosive devices, and armed combat. There were even 5 year olds used to plant bombs in south Afghanistan.\n\nAnother thing people must realize about Afghanistan is that women didn't lack rights in Afghanistan before Taliban took over. Look up pre-Taliban Afghanistan and women didn't need to wear veils and they were much more liberated and dressed in Western clothes and often had prestigious jobs. It was like America. Honestly if the CIA didn't give weapons to Islamic fundamentalist warriors in Afghanistan during the Afghan-Soviet War in the 80s, Taliban would've never taken over. That's how osama bin laden got his weapons. The CIA gave the mujahideen guerillas weapons which helped them fight off Soviets and they saved Afghanistan but these guerillas turned Afghanistan into another war zone. Then, the Taliban told Afghans that they would stop the war zones and offered an alternative, which many Afghans thought would liberate and save Afghanistan. They then recruited many people deceptively to increase the number of Taliban members, and this helped Taliban take over. A year after taking over, Taliban then began to become oppressive, which citizens didn't expect. If it wasn't for the CIA, the mujahideen wouldn't have taken over and thus Taliban wouldn't have been able to offer an alternative to citizens and take over. The CIA indirectly created Taliban. The CIA also are why Osama bin Laden managed to get weapons.\n\n**Iran**\n\nIran didn't make women dress a certain way or do anything particularly oppressive until 1979 when the Islamic Revolution happened. Before that, Iran was a secular monarchy and it wasn't different from the Western world. Women back then had more rights than women today in Iran. If it wasn't for the 1953 CIA assassination of their prime minister, King Shah wouldn't have had such a firm rule over Iran, which eventually led to Iranians having a fit about him and overthrowing him, creating modern Iran. The CIA's actions eventually led to modern Iran happening. But men in Iran have it just as bad as women in Iran. [This article](https://avoiceformen.com/featured/the-myth-of-patriarchal-oppression-in-iran/) should give a lot of information so read this article too. Boys in Iran are disproportionately raped or homeless, men are drafted, 81.9% of murder victims are men (see citation above for Afghan murder victims too which is where I got this from), and men are economically oppressed too. The media only shows what women go through. There's much more details about men's oppression in Iran. They aren't a patriarchy. They oppress everyone, just like America. For example, yes, men can divorce women for any reason while women can only divorce men for certain reasons, but women receive more benefits: \"Should a woman get divorced, in addition to what she gets out of her husband (called *Mehrieh*), her provider is considered to be her father and in case her father is dead, she will get from the government an equal share of her father’s occupational insurance as her salary for as long as she lives. This way, most divorced women do not have to work.\" Hell, mahr is something men have to pay to women in Iran if he divorces her and it's alimony but on steroids. Look up about it. Here's [two](https://avoiceformen.com/featured/indentured-servitude-for-men-in-iran-the-myth-of-patriarchal-oppressive-divorce-alimony/) [articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahr).\n\n**Syria and Iraq (ISIS)**\n\nThe media always talks about how ISIS oppress women, but they hurt men all the time. If you look at Syria, so many men are killed, including by ISIS.\n\n*Murder*\n\n[Since March 2011, when the Syrian civil war began all the way up to now, 228,647 Syrian civilians have been killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Syrian_civil_war#Civilian_deaths). 79.4% of them were men (181,540 men), 6.96% were women (15,925 women), and 13% were children (29,741 children). Many of these children probably are boys. This means women were the least likely to be killed and usually men are killed. In fact, of all the 5,043 civilians ISIS killed, 68.65% were men, 11.64% were women, and 19% were children. Of the 200,367 civilians killed by Syrian government forces, 82.24% were men, 11.45% were children, and 5.96% were women. This means it's typically men being killed there. [Within their first year following the 2014 declaration of Caliphate](https://www.ibtimes.co.in/isis-has-beheaded-stoned-shot-1362-civilians-including-9-children-report-630716), ISIS had already killed 1,362 civilians, including 9 children and 19 women. This means 97.94% were men.\n\n*Sexual assault*\n\n[Many times the media shows women being made as sexual slaves by ISIS. What they don't show is that many men face sexual abuse/rape in this region too](https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/latest/2017/12/5a27a4e04/male-rape-sexual-torture-widespread-syria-crisis-report.html). They often were held as prisoners and raped, gang raped, or sexually tortured with these men ranging from age 10 to age 80. They also might get jobs due to poverty while being sexually blackmailed or forced to do sexual favors in countries of asylum to be paid money. In asylum countries, boys might be molested by older youth and others. [This sexual abuse of men and boys is done by ISIS, other non-state armed groups, or even the Syrian government](https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/07/29/they-treated-us-monstrous-ways/sexual-violence-against-men-boys-and-transgender). LGBT men were particularly at risk, but it happened to men regardless of sexuality, including straight, cisgender men. A woman for The Guardian, a newspaper who are pro-feminist, [even said](https://www.theguardian.com/working-in-development/2017/nov/21/male-sexual-torture-in-the-syrian-war-it-is-everywhere) she initially thought this was rare but interview many refugees from that region and all of them, including all the women, told her that they knew many men who were raped or sexually tortured, and of all men detained in prisons, the female refugees estimated 30 to 40% of the detained men were sexually abused. Armed groups even conducted raids on homes and raped both men and women. When fleeing, boys were promised food or money by older boys but were instead molested. [Syrian men are just as often sexually assaulted or tortured as Syrian women](https://www.arabnews.com/node/1370701/middle-east). People think that in these countries, society hates women who get raped, but they don't. The social norms by a vocal minority who influence/form the government decide what is right and because these countries are often dictatorships/kingdoms, most people can't say what they truly think. People might pretend to view rape victims negatively, which is why being raped damages your reputation there, but people there actually don't feel this way towards rape victims. People hate rapists there, and Syrian families were horrified by the male and female rape victims in their family's stories of sexual assault victimization. Yeah, there are honor killings, but most murder victims there are men, and honor killings don't happen as much as the media says, and a considerable chunk of it happens in a couple specific countries.\n\n**Yemen**\n\n[Even in Yemen, men and boys are often sexually abused, raped or sexually tortured in detention centers](https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/countries/yemen/). [In 2020, about 62% of civilian casualties killed were men, but this article emphasizes women and children](https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/average-six-women-killed-every-week-yemen-result-ongoing-conflict). [Even in Yemen, men and boys are raped during conflict, and this is a problem that happens in conflicts worldwide, including in any other nation](https://web.archive.org/web/20190321220806/https://www.foxnews.com/world/male-rape-emerging-as-one-of-the-most-underreported-weapons-of-todays-wars). This problem even happened in Libya in the 2011 revolution. Even in yemen, boys as young as age 8 are raped by often militias aligned with the Saudi Arabia and UAE-led coalition. Psychologists treating former underage soldiers forced to fight for Houthis, an Islamist armed group in Yemen, found that 50 to 60% of them were sexually abused by their superiors.\n\n**Saudi Arabia**\n\nEven Saudi Arabia has their fair share of oppression of men. [When it comes to trafficking victims](https://www.state.gov/reports/2020-trafficking-in-persons-report/saudi-arabia/), they only give shelter to female domestic workers and nobody else. Only Riyadh had a place for male domestic workers. Men and women from other employment sectors were unprotected. People like to complain about how women are not allowed to walk out or go on an airplane without a male guardian (at least in the nighttime) but [young men weren't allowed in malls unless with a female relative in Saudi Arabia](http://www.alriyadh.com/1008285). [In fact, evidence shows that women in Saudi Arabia are more likely than men to be happy](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2020-12/spotlight.ksa_views_on_happiness.pdf). Saudi Arabia is more happy than most countries. People there might think people in the Western world treat women poorly, and that not allowing women to do certain things is protecting them. It's called benevolent sexism rather than misogyny (or hostile sexism). The way America views Saudi Arabia is how they view America, but the people there don't necessarily agree with the government laws. [In Saudi Arabia, virtually everyone who is executed is male](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-60722057), and there's many kinds of capital crimes there, and two-thirds of homicide victims are men (citation above). [In 2013](https://ncfm.org/2013/08/news/discrimination-news/discrimination-against-men-news/saudi-arabia-bans-domestic-abuse-because-it-hadnt-already/), Saudi Arabia banned domestic violence by men against women, but ONLY men committing domestic abuse against women. Women doing this to men wasn't even banned (although maybe they'll be charged with simply assault). So much for patriarchy. [In fact, in 2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20131109094735/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/02/saudi-protest-driving-ban-not-popular), most Saudi Arabian women opposed the right to drive and they believed it would lead to sexual harassment, men betraying them, and other problems. They believed it was horrible America would allow women to drive and thought it led to women being harmed or unsafe from predators, and believed this was an imitation of America. They instead believe America allowing women to drive is oppression. They believing being prohibited from driving was a privilege. In fact, this is similar to how long ago, many women often didn't want the right to vote because they believe suffrage was harmful to women by allowing them into the dangerous world of politics and considered the lack of right to vote a privilege or luckiness. [In fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_suffrage#Dates_by_country), Afghanistan didn't allow anyone to vote until 2004 where everyone including women could vote. Although women couldn't vote in Saudi Arabia until 2015, men couldn't until 2005, just ten years prior. Men are expected to pay full sum for the wedding even if his future wife makes more than him. Men are required to work as usual with no other option, but women can get the option to work and go to school (if given permission) or they can choose to be homemaker. While women can walk alone in the daytime, at night they are required to have a man with them, but this is an overprotective attitude about women, not misogyny (hate towards women). Society just doesn't care about men getting hurt.\n\n**Domestic violence**\n\n[There's surprisingly high rates of domestic abuse against men in the Arab countries, where way more men than women are victims of DV](https://www.arabbarometer.org/wp-content/uploads/Sexual-Harassement-Domestic-Violence-Arab-Citizens-Public-Opinion-2019.pdf). There are more male victims than female victims of domestic violence in Yemen (70% vs 19%) Libya (66% vs 17%) Tunisia (52% vs 32%) Palestine (51% vs 18%) Iraq (49% vs 17%) Jordan (48% vs 11%) Sudan (41% vs 25%) Algeria (34% vs 16%). There are more female victims of domestic violence than male victims in Morocco (35% vs 29%) Egypt (43% vs 26%) and Lebanon (56 vs 18%). Typically people there get help by contacting relatives instead of police for dealing with domestic abuse. They don't often contact police unless they're in Lebanon. Yes, women come forward in Arab countries. They contact the family, and the family intervenes. It's not like in the West where you call police.\n\n**Americans underestimate people's support for women's rights in these countries**\n\nPeople in these countries aren't as conservative as their governments might be. [Among men in Egypt](https://web.archive.org/web/20170503224119/http://imagesmena.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/04/IMAGESMENA-2017-FULL-Final.pdf), men can have conservative attitudes towards women but even men. These Egyptian men still had conservative attitudes about men, most believed men and women both should not have friends of opposite gender, and most of them (80%) believed that boys are responsibile for the behavior of their sisters, even if they're younger than their sister. This means they believe the boy should be held responsible for something the sister did. Many views in the data do show you that Egyptian men have conservative attitudes towards women, but people who have conservative attitudes about what women should do or their jobs don't feel this way due to hatred of women, but due to social norms/gender roles which they still believe about men, too. 94% believe men who fail to pay maintenence should be penalized. Women were far more likely to spank (79% of women and 41% of men) or hit their children (44% of women and 11% of men). Some of the men admitted to having slapped or pushed their wife before and some women experienced it but most did not experience in the past year. Relatively low percentages outright beat them, and even lower percentages did so in the past year. Hardly any threatened them with a weapon. 64% of Egyptian men and 60% of Egyptian women believed woman should marry her rapist (but it could be out of concern for her reputation), but 72% of men and 67% of women disagreed with the idea that rapists should not be prosecuted if he rapes a woman then marries her. Only just 16% of men believed a woman is obliged to have sex whenever the husband wants if he provides financially, compared to 33% of women thinking this. Nonetheless, 80% of men and 73% of women believe a woman should be able to refuse to have sex with her husband when she doesn't want to. **Remember this though, read Arab surveys with a grain of salt. As a guy who knows many Arab immigrants, many people in these countries might have a social desirability bias and will answer what they feel the government expects them to say or what the Western questionnaires expect them to say. They probably don't mean a lot of the things they say.**\n\n  \nAccording to [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/103441/saudi-arabia-majorities-support-womens-rights.aspx) in 2007 (and the results could be different these days), 67% of Saudi men believed men and women should have equal rights, 55% believed they should be able to drive, 75% believed women should be allowed to have any job they are qualified for outside home, 52% believed women should have leadership positions in the cabinet and national council, 83% said women should keep all earnings from jobs for themselves and that husbands should support them and the household in full, and 88% believe in divorce, the child's financial support should be full responsibility of the father even if the mom has custody. Iranians had similar attitudes too, and most Iranians supported women's right to drive, including most Iranian men.\n\n**Dress codes**\n\nPeople complain about how women are required to wear a veil, but this is only true in Saudi Arabia, Iran, and some of Afghanistan. It wasn't always true in these countries. Besides, in many countries they aren't required to wear anything and in any other country besides these 3 they aren't required to wear a veil but it is widespread. but only Saudi Arabia requires BURQAS. In Iran you still them wear normal clothes, just a mere hijab and they still show some of their hair. But men have a dress code too. [In Iran](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2013/11/07/IRN102671.E.pdf), men can't wear shorts or western hairstyles, and men who wear \"feminine\" clothes might get stripped or beaten. [Men have to cover knees, and cannot wear sleeveless shirts without stigmatization](https://www.bordersofadventure.com/iran-dress-code-what-to-wear/). [In Saudi Arabia](https://www.saudiarabiavisa.co.uk/dress-code-foreigners.html), men aren't required to wear thobes as tourists but must cover legs and shoulders. They must avoid skinny jeans, shorts or sleeveless shirts. [In fact](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/20/themalehijab), in Iran, up until maybe the 2000s, men were required to wear long-sleeved shirts before they could wear short-sleeved. [In Iraq](https://web.archive.org/web/20150529185836/https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/18/world/middleeast/a-haircut-in-iraq-can-be-the-death-of-the-barber.html), for example, barbers were killed by militias for giving \"un-Islamic\" haircuts or shaving beards. These Islamic militants tried to stop beardless men in Iraq. One Iraqi fled and said he was beaten up as onlookers cheered for lacking enough facial hair and wearing traditional clothes instead of a t-shirt and jeans or bright clothes or clothes with English writings. [Taliban](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2022-03-28/taliban-bars-government-employees-without-beards-from-work-sources) also set restrictions on men saying they will be fired from government unless they have beards and wear certain clothes. [Taliban even will severely punish any man without a beard and stop male drivers to check if he has a beard or not](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/rest-of-the-world-news/afghanistan-taliban-carries-out-vehicle-checks-to-see-mens-beards-womens-clothing-articleshow.html).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt's a myth that male privilege happens in Muslim countries. Men and women are both oppressed there and the media just focuses on when women are but ignores men's problems there. In fact, [the roots of sexism toward women in the Arab World go back to Ottoman empire problems, which is caused by western europe](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/the-real-roots-of-sexism-in-the-middle-east-its-not-islam-race-or-hate/256362/). It wasn't caused by Islam. These countries weren't even always like this and pre-Islamic Arabia was actually worse for women until Prophet Muhammad came. It wasn't until the past couple centuries (and couple decades in some countries) when it all changed. Dress codes in these countries used to be more diverse and vary until recent times.",

I came recently to Canada, fleeing from war.  \nI am an art restorer by trade, taught to me by one of my grandfathers , though mastered psychology and had worked for some time consulting, as well as in HR and project management. I work since I was 12. My  grandfather was a professor at the conservatory, family is almost 100% teachers, doctors, musicians and artists: I write this all not to boast or something - I just want to show I am no junkie, not an imbecile , I care about my child every way possible, I got on the very first survival job I could get to provide for my kid, I was driving around the city for a very long time, till I got him a decent daycare - and it was a real challenge, I tell you; I spent my time doing physical therapy, because he had a bit of a trouble with his legs, and exercises every evening, I taught him counting, abcs, music. \nBut I have made a mistake with a choice of a woman. She is a classic case of Bern’s “Red riding hood”. \nNow she wants to take away my son from me by court. She might be taking drugs again . She is with some other guy, the search for whom she started systematically and purposefully almost the moment we got off the plane. She wants to destroy and humiliate me .

    "text": "Just wanted to share my story of sexual abuse as a male So this happened twenty years ago on a Saturday night,\n\nI was 15 at a friends birthday party, she was 27 and my friends neighbour, she was a high school teacher and was friendly with my friends parents and was asked to chaperone the party as we were drinking,\n\nI ended up talking to her for one reason or another, cant remember what we talked about but i remember thinking it was cool or fun that i was having a drink with a teacher because i was a stupid teenager,\n\nAs it got later she ended up asking me if id like a ride home and again like a stupid teenager i jumped at the chance thinking a free ride is so cool,\n\nSo she went and told the parents she was going to drive me home as i seemed drunk and then she was going to go home herself,\n\nSo i get in her car, i didn’t live far at all, maybe 2km, approaching my street i start giving directions,\n\n“It’s coming up on the right”\n\n“It’s the next street”\n\n“It’s this one here”\n\nShe drives completely passed it,\n\n“We just passed it”\n\n“It’s back there”\n\nAll the while shes just saying in a calming voice “its okay, its okay”\n\nI didn’t really question what was happening as i believed i was with a trust worthy person, not just an adult but a teacher,\n\nI just remained quiet as i think i was a confused but trusted her,\n\nWe end up doing a loop around the back streets and end up pulling into the drive way to her house, i remember thinking maybe she forgot her drivers license or something like that because i was a stupid teenager,\n\nShe tells me to get out of the car and then leads me inside her house, it was a share house, she told me to be quiet so i don’t wake her housemates, she leads me into her room which was the first right in the hallway, she then asks me if id like to watch a movie, i say “sure”, im not sure why i agreed, i was just confused and maybe a bit scared, i also didn’t want to say no to an elder, but also my stupid teenage logic inner monologue was saying “im sure we’ll just watch the movie and then she’ll drive me home”, ”maybe she just really likes watching movies” and other stupid thoughts,\n\nShe starts going through a pile of bootleg DVD’s, the sort in thin flimsy plastic sleeve you used to buy in Bali or Thailand, and eventually picks out legally blonde 2, asking if ive seen it yet as it only came out in cinemas a few months ago, i reply no and she puts it on,\n\nShe tells me to take my shoes off and sit on the bed, i do,\n\nWe’re both laying on the bed watching the movie and about fifteen minutes in she starts cuddling up to me, i just kind of freeze up as she starts \nKissing my neck and fondling me, she starts taking my pants off and then performs felatio on me, i’m just frozen and have no idea whats happening or how to process it, i just stare at things around the room,\n\nShe ends up stripping me naked and then taking her own clothes off, she asks me to go down on her so i do,\n\nI’m not sure why i didnt say no, i dont think i knew how to, i dont think i wanted to be rude or dismissive of her, also with my stupid teenage logic i kind of thought well, she did it to me so i need to do it to her,\n\nShe then repeatedly and excitedly asked if i was a virgin, i had only had one sexual partner previously and I told her no i wasnt a virgin, but she kept insisting that i was/must be,\n\nShe then asks me to penetrate her, i was just a little bit erect, but enough to make it work somewhat i guess, we have sex, it doesn’t last for very long as it wasnt really workable, she ten asks me to go down on her again, i do until she climaxes and she then just rolls over, im just left laying on the bed, not sure what happened or what to do, i just kind of wait until she falls asleep and then i get dressed and leave, i walk home in a state of shock still processing everything,\n\nI get home and it hits me a bit more, i start sobbing as im washing my penis in the bathroom sink, i remember i didnt want to shower as it might wake my parents up so i used the sink to try and wash away my shame, i also remember thinking i might of gotten an STI or worse HIV from her as i was young and stupid so my remedy is to just wash it,\n\nI go to sleep and upon waking think it all might’ve just been a dream, i dont remember specifically telling friends about it on the Sunday but i do remember telling people at school on Monday morning, \n\nEveryone thought it was awesome and that i was a legend, the culture was very different back then, this is when all the teen sex romp comedies like American pie were really popular,\n\nEven teachers found out about it but i assume they just thought it was a lie or something, i remember my female friends being concerned but all my male friends would just give me a high five,\n\nI just considered it as a normal thing that happens for the longest of times, it wasn’t until about fifteen years after the incident that i addressed it again,\n\nFor years i openly talked about and no one ever told me i was abused, they instead congratulated me, it took at least 15 years before anyone even suggested it was in fact abuse,\n\nWith hindsight i think it considerably changed my life, i dropped out of school shortly after, got involved with drugs and alcohol, didnt aspire to higher education, not saying all these things were a direct result, but definitely a contributor,\n\nOne thing that was most certainly a direct result was erectile dysfunction, was never able to get it up again with a woman again until i was 21 and finally bit the bullet and went to a doctor to get viagra, after having healthy relationships with past partners its subsided but i still generally need to take it the first few times i sleep with anyone before trust is established.\n\nA few years ago when i finally started addressing it and not burying the incident in my subconscious there was a whole new layer of pain and questions that got brought up, the realisation that i was in fact kidnapped and abused, the self blame for not speaking up at the time, the premeditated planning, her telling the parents she was driving me home, all dwell on my mind still, probably the biggest question has always been why?\n\nWhat was i to her, what did she tell her housemates in the morning, was i just a joke, something they’d laugh about?\n\nThe final blow was when i finally decided to report the incident to police, zero interest despite the fact that my claims can be fact checked from my friends parents, how would i know the layout of her bedroom and which room it is if i wasn’t in there, why do school friends I haven’t spoken to in twenty years know about it, but zero interest, i was told i would get a follow up phone call and would need to make a formal report with police but nothing ever happened with it, i sympathise with female victims of sexual abuse but i cant help but feel like if genders were released with my story i would at least get a phone call from the police instead of nothing at all.\n\nTLDR; i was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a teacher and i was told i was lucky, 20 years later i reported it and no one cared.",

    "text": "A guilty woman? Then it can't be news. If it is reported, there will be no \"award\". Recently, a woman burned her lover alive, watched him burn and then went home as if nothing had happened. In this fire she not only killed her lover but also a teacher who had nothing to do with the incident. Because she made it look like a fire, it was not thought to be murder.\n\n[The murderous woman confessed 19 days later. In her statement to the police, she said, \"His dying screams haunt my dreams\" and that she felt remorse.](https://www.mynet.com/sevgilisini-diri-diri-yakti-karsiya-gecerek-izledi-19-gun-sonra-cigliklari-ruyalarima-giriyor-diyerek-her-seyi-itiraf-etti-110107159189)\n\nWould you expect news channels to report on such a situation? Yes, you would. However, in Turkey, it is encouraged not to report news that portrays women in a bad light. That's why you don't see women as thieves, murderers, rapists, abusers, torturers or violent in the news in Turkey. Women are only shown in the news when they are the victims. \n\nSince the Turkish people in general follow the news only on TV and are not in the habit of researching, the belief that women are angels and men are devils is widespread. It is not easy to access these news on the internet. Websites do not publish these news either. In fact, old news of this kind have started to be deleted. The source of this incentive is the state. [In the Presidential Development Plan](https://www.sbb.gov.tr/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Eleventh_Development_Plan_2019-2023.pdf), it is stated as follows:\n\n>604.2. Best practices like news, advertisements, series, movies, cartoons, children's programs which contribute to the improvement of women's representation in the media will be rewarded.   \n>  \n>604.3. Awareness raising training prog\u0002rams will be organized on the representation of women in media for the staff of regulatory and supervisory public institutions in the field of media.   \n>  \n>604.4. The representation of women in media and related subjects will be included in the undergraduate and graduate programs of the universities.\n\nEvery news channel and website distorts the facts in order to receive this \"award\".\n\nThis has been practiced for a long time. In fact, I can imagine that this is the case in most countries, but I don't know if there are examples where this is supported by the state.",

    "text": "I'm tired of men mistaking basic human decency for flirting Edit: whoever gave me my first award (!) and said they fucking hate what is happening and fucking love F1, you’re a gem \n\nUpdate for a mild rant: today I was talking to a couple of the other ladies in my class during break. One of them mentioned they love car racing, so I asked if she watches the F1. The other lady said “oh Jordan told me you like F1” and I was like wtf how would they even come up?? I forgot to ask her what context it was in but I definitely will on Friday (I think I’m going to tell her about it). Today in labs we tried out using a peak flow meter, which is a very phallic looking long tube thing you need to put your whole mouth over and forcefully blow into. Before I realised how it looked, I had a go facing the others and saw him watching me so I quickly spun around and faced the wall. Later he asked me how to do it (instead of asking the teacher) and wanted me to show him, obviously I just explained it and said “here’s the instructions”. He kept laughing at my jokes when he wasn’t even part of the conversation. I don’t think I spoke to him today other than like “excuse me” and he was very moody all day, idk if that had anything to it. It’s 50% lol and 50% wtf\n\n\nI (28) started in a new uni class for nursing about 3 weeks ago and there's a guy (22) who seems to assume I've been flirting since the very first day. He made a strange comment about my Blundstone boots (pull-up tradie boots in Aus) saying he hasn't seen them since he was a kid, which is strange considering they are very common. That's not to do with him flirting, but just a weird tidbit. Also, he's brought it up my boots twice.\n\nI'm only doing 2 units with this class as I have a bunch of credits. He messages me about assessments that he and the whole class know I'm not doing rather than asking in the group chat. The first time he messaged, he said he heard me saying I like naps (who doesn't) and wanted \"advice on how to nap\". I told him to get chronic fatigue and that will help wonders lol. Another time, I told him about ChatGPT and he keeps asking how to use it rather than googling it. A couple of days ago during break, he asked me to show him how to do custom instructions. I just told him what to do, and he went, \"okay. doesn't matter then.\" and walked off. \n\nLast week we had a 1 hour break between labs and class so I decided to drive up to the shops and get lunch. He saw me walking out and asked where I was going. When I told him, he said \"do you want some company or would you rather be alone?\" which is such a loaded question because how do I say no without it being weird? He went on saying he doesn't want to sit alone on his phone like everyone does and was super mopey. I couldn't think of an excuse quick enough so I said sure. I had planned to eat out but got takeaway so he wouldn't think it was a date vibe. He asked me so many things about my life, like where I grew up and went to school. He thanked me like 5 times and I was like sure no biggie, because it really isn't. He said it again at the end of class in front of everyone and put his hand on my shoulder. I see him looking at me from the other side of the classroom *all the time*. The other girls in my class are mostly 18-19 and stick together, but they're still nice, so I'm the only woman who really speaks to him. \n\nI'm dreading the moment he either asks me out or gets mad that I'm not showing interest because the whole class will pick up on a vibe and it will be so strange. I know I shouldn't have to lie about having a partner, but it's the only real option without making things extra weird for the next 18 months. He probably won't believe me anyway but at least that will hopefully get him off my back. He 100% has an incel vibe which makes everything worse.\n\nI just want to be left alone. Class isn't a place to pick up girls and it will never end well unless you're soulmates. I want him to act the same around me as he does with the other guys and the 40yo lady in my class. I don't want there to be a weird vibe in my class or have him mope around and be salty to me for the foreseeable future. I'm going to ask my lecturer not to pair me with the guys for the labs where we have to touch each other, especially for manual handling when you have your hands on the person's butt and lower back. I don't think mentioning him in particular is a good idea. \n\nThis happens to me *so much* because I'm very friendly and polite, and have basic human decency. But of course it always comes back to bite me in the ass because men can't seem to grasp the fact that women can be nice without being interested. Ugh.",

    "text": "why do men blame women for the (relatively) new disparity in college degrees? as most of you already know, women are now completing more college degrees than men. i keep seeing men saying that “society is holding men back”, “we don’t need feminism because women are getting more degrees”, “it’s not fair to men that women are graduating more now”. my question is: how do these men rationalize this reasoning/why do they think that it’s our fault? \n\nfor as long as i can remember, girls/women in my classes always worked hard, respected the teacher, completed homework, cared about their grades, prioritized academics, et cetera. on the other hand, boys/men in my classes have disrespected the teacher, not completed homework or asked to cheat off of mine, not studied, not cared about academics, said “school doesn’t matter”, et cetera. obviously these things don’t apply to every man and woman, but there’s a general pattern. \n\nwomen were not allowed in or were pushed out of higher education and education in general for years and years; now that we have the opportunity to achieve, we are doing it (and doing it well). in fact, we seem to have raised the standards, even though men don’t face any new barriers with women in schools, and women still face sexist attitudes and inappropriate comments all the time in education (i could rant for like 20 minutes just about my own experiences). why are we expected to pander to men who have skated by with the bare minimum for so long and are now unable or unwilling to put in more effort? why are we expected to take the blame for their failings when they have tried to hold us back every step of the way? why do they think that it’s our fault that they can’t achieve everything just because they are (usually white) men? how do we get these people to realize that our success doesn’t cause their demise?",

    "text": "Mistreatment of women in my country  \n\nHello girls, I'm Moroccan and I just want to let my thoughts about because I'm frustrated, I have observed that a significant number of Moroccan Muslim( my default assumption) men, and men from other Muslim-majority countries like Egypt and Algeria, treat women unfairly and disrespectfully. Some women also exhibit this behavior, but it is unclear what else these individuals have in common other than the religion, I'm trying to understand what is the common ground that they share. although it mostly has nothing to do with what Islam preaches. For instance, I have come across a Facebook group with over 200K members that refers to women in derogatory terms such as \" lmra hashak\" which is kind of hard to translate correctly but it means something along the lines of \" women are something disgusting, something you're sorry to see\" because the term \" hashak\" is mostly used while talking about donkeys or dogs  ,and \" 9hwya\" which literally means \" the brown girl\" but in a very offensive manner, obviously both racist and degrading because that's what their intention is while using it. Other Arabic groups share similar content, including pictures that are demeaning to women. Additionally, there was a post mentioning a national team competing in mathematics with only one girl and four boys, people left derogatory comments, calling women stupid. because there aren't more girls there, and because in my country it's known that girls mostly get higher grades and pass more exams than men, such as exam to become a lawyer teacher etc., so when there is any post about any team that contains more men than women they immediately make everything girls did worthless,  And It happens with any post where there is anything about women sadly. I always check the comments hoping I'm wrong, just to be let down. They also do not acknowledge women's achievements throughout history or recognize the success of many women who did not get the recognition they deserved due to historical discrimination.\n\nIt is disheartening to see that many individuals in these communities blame the victim in rape cases and even defend pedophilia. In my high school, I witnessed four teachers who slept with 13-15-year-old girls or even younger. I want to understand why such mistreatment of women is prevalent in these societies and why some individuals think it is acceptable. I had hoped that in other environments such as university, things would be better, but unfortunately, I was once again disappointed. Even my professors speak about women in a derogatory manner, giving examples of them being stupid, crazy, and so on, even when the material they're teaching is unrelated to such topics. When they ask my mostly male classmates if they agree, they laugh and make even more offensive remarks. Some even go as far as to suggest that they would do worse things themselves.\n\nI once even tried to stop the professor and all he did was telling me \"you'll understand why men are better when you get married\". \n\nI just want to know if it's okay for me to have hatred for men in my country, and all the ones with similar mentality, or am I wrong? because I don't know why even the girls agree with them, if there is a rape case, it's women's fault, if there's assault case, it's women's fault. etc.\n\nThere is also a whole group that has the hashtag \"#NoToMarryingWorkingWomen\" where they say they won't marry any woman who works, because she gets exploited by her director and she isn't only his, but his and the director's too, and that they don't cook, and won't find time to take care of the children and him, and because she will start to go out with friends etc.\n\nAnd the list goes on obviously. \n\nI just don't get the hatred, is this also this common in your countries?\n\n Examples of such posts that they share, I provided translation :\n\n[https://ibb.co/c8Rn9ZM](https://ibb.co/c8Rn9ZM) \\- this photo was taken from a video where a girl was walking with a skirt and some man lifted her skirt and obviously sexually harassed her and slapped her bottom. they call him king for doing so. and when this happen most men were saying the girl deserved it for going out like that.\n\n[https://ibb.co/wQwzDm3](https://ibb.co/wQwzDm3) : insulting an inventor, and the comments kept saying she didn't help them make WIFI, she just opened her legs.\n\n> [https://ibb.co/jwM9Cjh](https://ibb.co/jwM9Cjh) : as for this one, the post says \" does women deserve to and the answers are \" she does \" \"she doesn't\" and everyone picked she doesn't, meaning they stopped at \" she doesn't deserve \" referring to she doesn't deserve anything. \"",

    "text": "How to learn to play? Women are not taught to enjoy playing games and sports. I freeze everytime I am playing - video games,  board games, baseball, volleyball, pool, pub quiz. I think it's directly linked to the experience of being a woman. How to work on this? Did you manage to overcome it?\n\nSo, it is a known fact that women participate in sports less than men, from a very young age for a variety of reasons. I was one of these girls, haven't really played sports outside of compulsory PE. And the compulsory classes often didn't happen as it was somehow acceptable for the girls' teachers to cancel a class if we asked \"because we had so much homework\", because of periods, shame of growing boobs or having forgotten to shave our 13 year old legs. It's not that I didn't like sports, it's more that I didn't think I could be good at it, it was not very encouraged, not a part of hanging out with my friends and just not a thing.\n\nOn the other hand, I barely ever played video games or board games, bowling, pool in a pub or anything similar.\n\nNow, as an almost 30 years old adult, I struggle with participating in any of these. I freeze when my partner shows me a new little game. I freeze when somebody suggests playing a board game at a social outing or passes me a baseball on a family barbecue. I just get very reserved, nervous and don't feel like doing any of these, while as such I am a very social and pretty confident person. And deep down, I really like all of these activities - I am just afraid of being judged, sometimes think that they are an unnecessary waste of time (especially video games) and don't allow myself to indulge.\n\nI managed to learn how to go to the gym, but either for group classes or for personal training where I am learning how to be comfortable doing a physical activity around other people. I enjoy a few games, but only if I know their rules very well  like bowling or scrabble. \n\nAny tips on how to overcome these feelings? I believe they are very connected and many women that I have spoken to have similar experience, because of games not being seen as a typical women's behavior. We are seen chatting, shopping, drinking coffees or wine, reading, doing sports like yoga. I believe women and girls deserve to play (in all the meanings of the word) and I think about the ways to reverse this conditioning.",

    "text": "Casual misogyny effects in long term This is a rant post. Feel free to ignore.\n\nI grew up in a not very happy household where femininity or any female related things are looked down upon.  All the clothes, make up, superficial stuff for example. Pregnancy and motherhood. Being a stay at home = being lazy. Whereas all the masculine features are over inflated. You know \"protect, provide and lead\" shit. So after all of that disdain i kinda rejected my femininity. I was extremely embarassed by my gender. I hated being a girl. I hated that i would grew up to a woman. I hated that i didnt have any strong woman i could look up to(majority of scientists and leaders are all male also i dont have any strong woman as example so :/ little me is like \"what the heck do i do?\") Strong woman examples i had are not like \"oh she studied so hard but she did it against the odds\" but its more like \"look how RARE she is amongst all those mindless females who are not interested in working hard or studying\" and thats it. I hated being physically being weak. I hated my body for periods and shit, it hurts dude. I hated that \"women fight eachother and backstab eachother all the time and must be shepherded otherwise they will kill/eat eachother\" even tho that never happened to me, never had beef with my friends. Since all we are good for is giving birth. And women who works lost their femininity and are like dudes now, rude and assertive 🙄. I didnt hate my girlfriends or anything like that but i was a bit more critical on them for being feminine. I guess i wanted them to be more masculine more ambitious(how is that a masculine trait tho? But i associated both more back then) more aggressive. Cuz in my mind they are good things and the only respectable way to survive instead of all the superficial/meaningless/feminine stuff. \n\nI still think like that in some aspects but i dont want to. Its disgusting how i was raised to be an enemy of my own gender. But on the other hand, a piece of me is wondering of that changed my direction of my life for the better..? People wanted me to become a teacher or a pharmacist, something more \"nurturing and a job where i can just chill\", where i can take the time off when i inevitable have kids one day. So i choose the opposite, i became a computer scientist(9-6) which i love my job, it has a bright future and fun for me. Ive always had a disdain for babies since they need us to survive(along with other materialistic reasons, babies are indeed expensive). Then i had a disdain for motherhood as well like why would anyone do that to themselves..? Since mothers get no help or respect from the kids or the husband unless the kids are old enough to comprehend appreciation for their parents. So yea im an antinatalist too. I dont want to \"lower myslef to that position\" i suppose.\n\nIm happy where i am now. Im comfy. I generally dont have a problem with my way looking at life. It doesnt hurt me or makes me upset. I just want the origion of my thoughts to be different i suppose. On motherbood for example. It is not the mothers fault for not being able to get help. Its because no ones around to help them. Good attentive emotionally nurturing fathers are a rarity and indeed KINGS. About feminine stuff, like wtf is wrong with liking pink color why does that makes you a bimbo? Or on the other hand why does everything related to womanhood is related to pink..? What about the other colors? Why cant i be ambitious and still be feminine? Talking back, speaking up are masculine now? Jeans are masculine? Having a job is masculine? Having a pet is bad if you are a woman? What? I have a lot of stuff i need to unlearn, and i realized this after seeing all the dumbass shit on the internet like i listed above, i followed where that leads and this is how i realized my internal misogyny and it is kinda embarassing that i was made to be in this mindset. \n\nDivide and conquer. Thats what they are doing to us. And i was certainly divided. Im not interested in the nurturing stuff ig(except for the fluffy friends heh) but i wanna be a good example of a human being. And i wanna live with my cats, hang and gossip with my besties when im old. Fuck all misogynist. I will not embrace my own femininity. I dont care and im not interested in it for myself. But i wont judge others for doing it. \n\nWell this was a long rant. If you read the whole thing. Thank you. Peace and love. ✌️",

    "text": "Young Men and Hostile Sexism I am a psychology researcher, and enjoy studying criminal justice and social issue. I’m trying to collect statistical, peer reviewed data for what I'm seeing. It appears as if young men as young as 11/12 are turning to hostile sexism more so than previously. They do it to teachers (apparently that's a huge problem) sisters, mothers, young kids, adults - really anyone\n\nGrowing up evangelical Baptist, the Red Pill Manosphere is almost exactly what I heard growing [up. It was](https://up.it/) shaming, evil, hateful, violent, would rather women pass away than terminate a pregnancy. They thrive on a culture of women deserving abuse. However a lot of that in the past was benevolent sexism and infantilizing. Now I see growing numbers of men who are leaning towards hostile sexism and causing their own issue of loneliness.\n\nI see the famous, privileged Alpha Bro podcasts giving terrible relationships to encourage impressionable viewers that young women are nothing but servants and sex toys. I do believe that men will listen to good male leaders, but any time I look into those conversations, young men are trying to shut down the idea of self improvement. They attack the guy who is telling a straight man \"this is how to help your relationship\" and the response in a hostile way, attacking a happy man in a relationship to drag **him** down.\n\nDaily comments go from pedophilic desires, rape threats, invasive comments and pure vitriol. If a woman tries to make a post, article, or video about women's issues and that is the only time I see men talk about men's issues, other than the podcasts which are full of toxic information that will absolutely end in a break up. These Men's Rights Activists and WASPS are hindering the possibility of their relationships being successful.\n\nThey convince men that they *need* to cheat because \"they have needs\". They shut down these healthy men in favor of listening to podcasts that validate their feelings and blame their shortcomings on \"used up hoes\".It seems like now more than ever in my studies and life that men are completely okay with admitting to their immoral behavior but expect the woman to be as pure as driven snow.\n\nI think we are in the midst of a pendulum swing. Remember all the SJW stuff that is really cringy now? I feel like the alt right pipeline of misogynists is getting more and more brazenly violent in words and actions.\n\nOnly found one study about sexism of Gen Z was specifically in NC. Young voters are becoming increasingly less supportive of women in leadership. What are your thoughts:\n\nTl:Dr - I'm noticing more hostile sexism among American men, especially Gen Z and young Millennials. Have you noticed this too? Do you think there will ever be studies about this in time?",

    "text": "holes aren't the problem; assholes are (essay about dress code) when i (currently 17F) was in 5th grade, we were given a talk about dress code in gym class. so from the ripe age of 10, the idea that dress code being geared towards women was ingrained in our brains from then on. that was mostly because they said in clear quotes, \"this is the age when boys are gonna start looking at you.\" i remember what once was okay to wear was no longer acceptable by that age. i was in catholic school from ages 4 to 15, so dress code violations were mainly for short skirt lengths as well as the occasional short shorts for gym class. i received my first dress code violation for having my skirt 3 inches above my knee. i cried after, not knowing what was happening. i remember wondering \"what's wrong with my body?\" i asked myself if when boys looked at me, did they see an object or a person? i'm lucky to have learned from my amazing parents early on that i was not the problem, that as a girl in this screwed up school system, this was the unfortunate reality i was subjected to. that's why i knew they'd be by my side if something like this were to happen again. \n\nand it did. in 6th grade, i started to play around with makeup, as almost any preteen would. i'll admit it didn't look good while i was still learning, but nonetheless it made me happy. one teacher in particular hated that, and she would quickly squander that happiness any chance she got. with each violation, i wore less and less: removing the eyebrow powder (which was horrendously hideous), then went the mascara, then the blush after. i was finally down to simple concealer. that was the one day my teacher cracked. she called me up to her desk. it was nothing new for me at that point, but considering how seamless my makeup was, i assumed it was to talk about homework or something that was actually important. i don't remember most of what happened before this grown woman grabbed me and forcibly wiped my face down with a makeup wipe, my whole class standing there and watching like it was a car wreck they couldn't look away from. i was 12 years old when that happened. there's no describing my experience in the office after that incident, the principal gaslighting me into thinking i was selfish for being so vain and as a catholic i should only care what god thinks, blah blah blah. even when i would try to tell them i didn't do it for boys, they would treat it like deep down i was seeking their attention without even knowing it, \"it's just how it works.\" how does that even make sense to a kid that age? long story short, i was given ISS, while the teacher received no punishment. but i'll tell you one thing: even though i wore subtle, natural makeup from that point on, nobody at that school ever remotely accused me of anything again. \n\nyears later, i left catholic school after freshman year for unrelated reasons. after completing my sophomore year online, it was time to start my junior year at public school, where i could have a fresh start. my first year there ran pretty smoothly, no trouble with any students or teachers or staff members. to me, it was bliss; coming from a world where someone always had something to say, this was a culture shock to say the least. fast forward to what is now my third week of senior year. i wore a sweater i found at ross which had some holds in it. i, nor anyone who's ever seen me in the sweater, saw anything wrong with it. even if i opted to wear a bra instead of a tank top underneath, one would have to take a long hard look to notice it. that was proven to be true when last period rolled around. the principal just had to be plopped right in front of where i had to go for my last class of the day. she stopped me and told me my sweater was inappropriate. i then politely indicated i had to go to class to take a test, when she just said \"nope, nope, you're coming with me.\" she then had to ask another person what my name was, to which i laughed hysterically. and who wouldn't? the only time anybody gets recognized at this school is for the things they do wrong; if you've got a clean record all 4 years at this place, you'd walk out without them having any clue you walked in to begin with. i acted irrationally, i'll admit. i tried working my way around this issue by throwing away the t-shirt they gave me. i can now admit that i did it all because i didn't feel it was right. the girl i used to be would subject herself to the utter shame and humiliation of putting on a school t-shirt and have everyone in that class know damn well what happened. somehow with no past misconduct, i was treated like i was a delinquent. anyone who knows me knows i don't appreciate being seen as or assumed to be someone i'm not, especially since i was outnumbered 5-to-1 by adults telling me they could get me \"help\" with the school counselor. somehow, i was brought right back to my days in catholic school. i was given OSS (out of school suspension) for dress code, failure to report, and inappropriate conduct. i was then told it was not on my permanent record and i could turn all my late work in for full credit. so i guess it turned out to be a free day off for me. \n\nmy whole life i feel like i've been restlessly hunted down by adults around me. the only reason i can come up with is that i simply don't comply if something they tell me to do compromises my own value as a human being. aside from a select few, any administrator now only sees me as a mere set of hips with a flashy waist with breasts barely big enough to fit in a bra—all being held up by a pair of alluring legs which reach 5 feet and 1 inch. i know others have had it worse when it comes to being wrongfully dress coded, primarily girls who are more curvy and still wearing a school-appropriate outfit which may look more sexualized to a grown adult's despicable perspective. no matter anyone's experience with dress code violations, case in point: that's a beautiful dress, and don't let anyone make you feel sexualized in it just because they focused on your legs instead. it's okay to wear that top that's a little thin or perhaps sheer; we live in one of the hottest states in America (FL),after all. your outfit is not inappropriate, but the way in which the grown adult that called you out may have seen your outfit is. you are more than what anyone may see on the outside, so don't ever let anyone diminish who you are on the inside. that is why those holes in your clothes are not the problem; the assholes who saw through them are.\n\n\n(edit)\n\nif anyone from my school administration is reading this right now, i bet you are a little irate with me sharing this essay on any platform i could possibly gain access to. unfortunately, this has come down to be my only option to properly standing up to you all in a more civilized manner, while also exercising my 1st amendment right to freedom of speech. the only apology i am going to give is this: i sincerely apologize if you expected an apology. because you won't be getting one from me any time soon.",

    "text": "TW assault. An essay I wrote a couple months ago On Being Afraid as a Feminine Person:\n    I was seven when I first learned something I was too young to know. My second grade teacher, a tall man in his 50s, told all of my classmates to stand up and point to our genitals, all in the name of “safety”. I later realised he was probably getting off to our sheepish, embarrassed faces, pointing to our “private parts”.\n    This wasn’t the first incident where I was reminded of what it was like to be raised in America, much less as a person assigned female at birth. At around 11, my sister was approached on a bike ride by a much older man, who told her to follow him. She would have probably ended up on the news, had it not been for some passing older women who scared him off.\n    At thirteen, I was called “beautiful” in a store by a man who followed me to my car. At the time, I had already grown terrified of men, especially older ones. The stares that followed me on the street, the microaggressions, the news articles about countless women and girls, raped and murdered- all of these things filled me with fear. I’ve started carrying a knife when I go out in public, and hope these people will see it clipped to my belt and not engage. \n    This terror of men doesn’t just come from the ones on the street: it comes from within my own home and school. As a child, my mother would tell me about her father; how he would scream at her and her siblings, awful words that cut deep. Visiting his house, I soon saw remnants of this abuse- when he would demand things of my grandmother, his wife, and insult her in the same breath. From that point I was wary of ever marrying a man. \n    It’s funny to me: how little girls are taught to trust men, trust the boys in their classes, but also to be wary of them. From youth, we teach girls to love boys, to find husbands, but also not to provoke them; not to say anything that might set them off. It’s similar to loving a venomous snake that may strike at any moment.\n    Recently this hypocrisy was demonstrated at my school. A boy, a freshman, was thrown in a locker room and raped with a plunger by a group of male soccer players. My mother, after expressing her condolences about the fate of the poor young man, told me that this was a clear reason for me to not “set anyone off”- especially a group of boys. This warning came from the mouth of the same woman who talks all the time about finding a nice boy after college and giving her grandbabies. \n    I ask this- how am I supposed to carry out this wish, even if I wanted to? How can I remain silent, not get into an argument with any boys about politics or feminism because they might hurt me for it, but then marry a man? How can I learn to be powerful, but still silent enough so they don’t rape me, or kill me? \n    It is my wish that eventually, people socialised as female will no longer have to walk down the street in fear. It is my wish that eventually, people socialised as female will be able to trust men enough to discuss politics with them and challenge their ideas without fearing revenge. It is my wish that all people, not just women, will not have to fear anyone; not our fathers, not our classmates, not the men we pass on the street.",

    "text": "Illusion of Consent Some of this is US specific, some is general feelings.\n\nAutonomy vs Justice\n\nThe more I read and experience the more I’m baffled by the consent conversations. YES, consent matters. However, we live in a patriarchy. Informed consent implies two (or more) parties of equal power coming to an agreement whereas folks AFAB literally come out of the womb with limited access to power over their own bodies. We recognize power dynamics in teacher/student relations, therapist/client relations, even employer/employee situations. Why isn’t the greater power dynamic talked about?\n\nIt is only recently (the 90s) that marital rape was made illegal in all 50 states. Roe was just overturned. In the 80s, it was finally overturned that men are “head of household and master” with unilateral control over property, same time the first woman got to SCOTUS. 2007 is when we had our first female speaker of the house.\n\nFor centuries, women weren’t allowed to hold property because they were considered property. They didn’t get credit scores when the credit system was first put in place. They weren’t/aren’t paid equally for equal work. Marriage was literally a contract transitioning property from one man (the father) to another (the husband). We are raised from infancy to seek out a husband because that benefits men while simultaneously being told we hold men back. Everything in society is about getting our compliance so men can get what they want from us and face minimal consequences. Men hold all the societal power. \n\nWe are not on equal footing with men in this patriarchal world. At no point in my life was I making a free and educated choice to interact with men in my life. I keep looking for instances of actual consent and I just see power imbalances everywhere and indignant AFAB folks claiming they can freely consent.\n\nI’m struggling to see choice. It is even worse in some countries, slightly better in others. None of them are free from it.",

    "text": "Why is it that a group of women will often be addressed as “ladies” but a group of men is rarely addressed as “gentlemen”? Do you like being called ladies? (See body text for detailed context) Ok so I’ve noticed that when 2 or more women are together (for example, out shipping or buying coffee etc.) they will often be addressed as “ladies” but when 2 or more men are out in public, at least for me, I’ve rarely seen them being addressed as “gentlemen” and I find this very odd and abnormal. Back in my school days, our teacher will treat all the students equally, referring to girls as ladies and boys as gentlemen. And that felt just fine. But it seems like in the adult world it is very different. And one thing I will emphasize is that it seem to be a regional thing as well. Growing up in the west coast, or even the mount west region, terminologies like ladies are used as frequent as saying “what’s up” \nit’s like it just blurts out of people’s mouth without a second thought. When living in Texas, I’ve noticed that this terminology is rarely used or brought up. Which I appreciate. I’ve for the most part hate being addressed as “ladies”. And it seems to be mostly women that like to address other women as “ladies” too. And I find this super annoying. If you enjoy to be called a lady, it doesn’t mean others do too. And it really depends on the person as well as circumstances. My boss addressing me as a talented young lady have no problem with me, but when I’m out in public with another woman just occasionally picking up our to go order and bring address as “ladies” is just odd and unnecessary and doesn’t really fit with the environment. I can see maybe if you’re shopping at an quite expensive boutique and you get called this way makes sense, but not in situations like I’ve mentioned. (Casually buying coffee or going to a bank teller) and if they obsess calling us “ladies” as they’re trying to be “polite” why are they not address guys as “gentlemen”? Which is totally the equivalent version for men. Why are they so hung up on women? Do you like being addressed as “ladies”? Back in high school one of my teacher had a habit of calling girls as “ladies” and one day a girl had enough and literally told him in front of all the students that “we have names you know” I’m sure she doesn’t expect the teacher to actually individually call out everybody’s name in a group but you get her point. It seems like I’m not the only one irritated by this phenomenon.",

    "text": "Realised this week that all this talk about impostor syndrome was actually what kept me from being taken serious at work. Any own experiences? I(32f)am currently retraining as an IT specialist. \nWe've had a reform in the makeup of the entire apprenticeship with regard to what is now being taught at both work and vocational school in my country. To say it's chaotic is an understatement. \n\nMy original trainer recently quit. They weren't very hands-on, I pretty much taught myself everything via tutorials from home and projects where I hit a dead-end and needed help or input were frequently just dropped unfinished. Despite my best efforts I felt lost and like I was making little progress, especially compared to my peers. \n\nI spoke to a few people about feeling like I was falling behind. Teachers, colleagues, my new trainer, other people involved in coordinating trainee issues at my firm. The response was the same every time. \"Cleary impostor syndrome!\". Because I have good grades people weren't even listening to what exactly what I was struggling with. \nI know that I'm good at the theoretical stuff but I had no practical training whatsoever and no idea how to implement the things I was learning. \n\nIt had to be something with me. Too high standards, perfectionism, the mentioned impostor syndrome, self esteem or psychological problems. I wasn't even realising how much this was messing with me and making me doubt my own perception more and more until we had a talk with a sort of reintegration liaison that is brought into play after a longer absence due to illness (which in my case wasn't related, because I was missing work due to Covid) to figure out how the workplace can better meet needs of a worker with a need for professional reintegration after or with chronic illness. But I am glad what it kicked into motion nonetheless. \n\nBecause, when we had our talk it turned out, like I had suspected, no one had any idea what I had been learning (or, well.. not) all this time with my former trainer. When pressed my new trainer finally acknowledged that they had no actual idea that or how far I was behind and that now they (and another colleague that was present) were seeing what I meant when I talked about gaps in my knowledge and lack of hands-on experience.. We've made changes and I'm finally starting to gain some traction. \n\nBut it makes me angry that we now know and talk about things like impostor syndrome but it's again something that may lead to us not being taken seriously. It's a bit like no matter what findings and studies there are, trying to highlight what it's like to be a woman, you still have to be really careful that these things will actually be interpreted in a way to actually benefit women instead of being another thing that adds to the pile. \nI'm angry that I let all of this have me doubt my own perception, that without me getting Covid this never would have been addressed. \n\nTL;DR: Was worried I was falling behind as an apprentice and not taken seriously by several people who put my feelings of struggle down to \"impostor syndrome\" until I started constantly doubting myself and my reality. \n\nI'm curious if I'm the only person something like this has happened to. Or have you had similar experiences? Not particularly with impostor syndrome.",
