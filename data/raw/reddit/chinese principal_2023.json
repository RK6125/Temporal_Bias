    "text": "I have an objectively bad teacher. How can I approach this? Hi all.\n\nI am an exchange student, currently studying Chinese at a Taiwanese university. We have 3 different teachers every week. Two of them are very competent and make the class interesting and instructive. However, the third teacher, while being very warmhearted and well-intended, simply is unbearable when it comes to her teaching methods. She constantly goes on tangents outside of what we're learning, and she is very, veeeeeeeery slow. I have a good attention span, but I simply cannot help either dozing off or, you guessed it, ending up on my phone or doing whatever (never in other classes!!). She's confused and, due to her age, I think she may be starting to become forgetful. I've tried to talk to her, but I've seen no change.\n\nThe office won't do anything either, because she's the wife of the principal. She loves teaching, I've no doubt, but as teachers, what would be your advice?\n\nKind regards, Bj√∏rn.",
