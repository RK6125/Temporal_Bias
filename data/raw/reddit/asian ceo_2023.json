    "text": "My company is a scam. Do I quit without having something else lined up? I joined a tech startup back in January. I was eager to get a change of pace after seven years in a very safe, corporate job. I quickly found that the job was way more high-stress than I was anticipating, and there was no effective process to get anything done. I also found that our products were really shoddy. It was embarrassing to see the quality of work we put out. I started to suspect that something wasn’t right. Today I learned that my suspicions were true. Multiple news sites (including WSJ) accused the company of lying about how it operates to secure funding and customers. I think the company got the heat off of it by changing its name, but I can attest firsthand that it’s practices remain the same. On top of that, our CEO has a warrant for his arrest in a large Asian country for being a witness/possible suspect to a money laundering scheme of $7 million. \n\nI realize I need to get out of this company ASAP. I guess what I’m looking for advice on is do I listen to my ethics and put in my two weeks without having something else lined up? Perhaps get a bartending gig to pay rent until I find a new job? Or do I keep my head down and job hunt like crazy while I collect a steady paycheck?",

    "text": "Confused and Depressed . Need Advice May 2023 grad international in the US (worked for 3 years back home) , I joined this startup in june and its been a fking sweatshop since then . Its a dumpster fire 24x7 its panic , ceo and cto are related which makes things worse as there is no transparency and they treat employees like slaves who are available 24x7. In my 4 months here I have not even written a single line of code , all they make me do is random bs stuff like reporting etc . here its like okay we have this thing all are busy..oh you are free you do this(irrespective of whatever your background is like once i was told to make privacy laws lol)\n\nAlso its like people work 9 to 6 and then 8 to 10. the ceo acts like a commander , its all a command style management plus there are no ethics no professionalism at all. Like for example the cto had covid still she would come in to the office and the ceo wouldn’t give a shit (c’mon protecting your employees from health hazards like this is a common sense , i had got covid coz of that ) . Like another instance is keeping calls on a sunday that too 9pm - 3am (wtf) .\n\nIts a 4 day rto , which makes it more worse \n\nComing to the pay its god awful , like roughly 20-25$ per hour and no overtime pay. All are south asians(not being racist here , i am south asian myself) and roughly theres just 8 people and seems like i am the only swe here other all have titles but they don’t do what their titles mean. Also there are no policies here , one of the colleagues told me that in the past dude fired 3 interns . just told them “you go and don’t come from tomorrow” .\n\nMy mental health has gone south , all time stress can’t even prep nor apply outside . So i need your advice here :\n\nOption 1 : Leave this bs startup , join a volunteering firm to stop unemployment clock , prep tf out and get a new job. Money wouldn’t come in but I can manage that for atleast 6-7 months. I see roles opening too so theres some ray of hope\n\nOption 2 : Continue in this startup keep making bank with whatever little money i get , don;t give a shit and keep preping applying (this would be priority). Here consequences would be that I would get fired\n\nI am in dire need of help and guidance , would be ever grateful for it . Also i appreciate your patience and kindness if you read till here.",

    "text": "Does the glass ceiling not apply to South Asians? I am Chinese American and have a lot of friends/family who are the same. Many of them are the kind of people who studied hard, went to good schools, work hard and have jobs at big tech companies where they make good money. From what I've heard Asians dominate many tech industries.\n\nHowever it seems like there is a glass ceiling and you rarely see Asian CEO at these companies which the exception of South Asians. If you just look at the US biggest companies #2 Microsoft and #3 Google have Indian CEO's and #5 Berkshire Hathaway it is likely Warren Buffet will be replaced by Ajit Jain who is Indian American. The CEO of Twitter is Indian American and Google just promoted an Indian American to run YouTube.\n\nI have a lot of respect for Indians and some of my best friends are Indian American. Indians are 1% of US population and Asians are 8%. Just curious why it seems like they can pass the glass ceiling while the rest of us cannot.",
