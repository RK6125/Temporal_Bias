    "text": "Assault at Church **I’m writing this encounter nearly thirteen years after it happened. It’s sleepless nights like now when I’m compelled to reopen old memories. So, if you don’t mind reading about a naive preteen, asinine (and racist) adults and one sick pervert all mushed into one story, here goes:\n\n-\n\nIt all started in the summer of 2006 at a local teen bible study group (where really it was a place for teens to hang out and volunteer at). The location was held in an Asian Empowerment-Christian church so everyone was 99.9% Asian so my being not full Asian (I’m Japanese and Mexican), I nonetheless stood out like a sore thumb. And other church members often made jabs at my tan skin and high bridged nose, and adding things like “Sorry we don’t serve tacos! Just fried rice!” to even doubting my Japanese last name (“Did you take this name from an anime?”). I sound like I’m digressing but this information will be relevant in a bit. \n\nIn retrospect, I don’t know why I didn’t catch these red flags. I should’ve just left and enjoyed my summer at home. I sat alone most of the time anyway. No one noticed my discomfort save for one person. \n\nLogan.\n\nLogan was this tall Asian twenty-something year old man. He was related to one of the Bible study leaders but only showed up a few times a month. Logan was slim and tall, wore Hollister apparel and slick, black hair that parted at the middle. I remember his humor and laidback style made me feel comfortable around him. Logan even went as far as to ruffle my hair and sit next to me during bible study. He even went as far as commenting on my looks, saying he liked my eyes a lot. That I looked mature for a thirteen year old. Quite the charmer, I thought.\n\nOne day, we were supposed to meet up at a baseball game and Logan offered me and a few others a ride for carpool. As luck would have it, when I arrived at the church (our meet up location), he was the only car there. I asked him where the others were to which he replied that they they all left early since they didn’t want to wait up on us. I found it strange since it wasn’t even that late to begin with. Ignoring my gut, I silently went inside the car anyway.\n\n This is when it starts getting scary. \n\nAs I was opening the backdoor, he was motioning for me to sit in front. I usually didn’t feel comfortable sitting in front with non-family members at the time. I insisted that I was okay - I even joked that he was my chauffeur. But Logan’s face didn’t show that he took my awkward humor well. He turned around with a serious expression. Not saying a word. I stared back, wondering what was wrong. Before I was able to ask, Logan reached over for my hand and began smothering kisses on it. Stunned and confused, I immediately yanked my hand back. I was speechless, not even asking why he was doing what he was doing. His eyes were still glaring and his usual kind voice was now more hitched and deep. “It’s fine. You know me. You like me,” he whispered as he unclipped his seatbelt. He began lifting his body towards the backseat. In that split second, I knew I was in danger. I saw that the backdoor wasn’t locked and I opened the car to make a run for it. I don’t know what came over me that day but I remember losing control of my body at that moment. All senses were hazy. \n\nI later found myself in the pizza parlor that was down the street. I sat there in one of the booths. I just had to be around other people. Other strangers where I could feel immersed once again. Hidden away from Logan’s eyes. After what felt like an hour, I called my friend (who lived nearby) if she and her mom could pick me up. \n\nIt was the last time I ever stepped into those church grounds. I didn’t tell anyone immediately and I had planned it that way until I received a call from the church leader - Logan’s sister. She asked if I was alright and where I had been. It was then that I broke down and spilled the story about what happened to me. She didn’t say anything. Only silence hung around the atmosphere. I doubted at that moment if I made the right decision. \n\nLogan’s sister finally broke the silence and I wished she hadn’t.\n\n“You’re at that age when...we don’t know what we seek. We look for something to compensate what we’re missing...which is usually the case for Hispanic girls like you. It’s no wonder you guys get pregnant so early, you know? Break away from that, ok?”\n\nI didn’t even believe what I was hearing. She was insulting me in every way possible under the guise of a benevolent church leader. Someone who was meant to help - not judge you nor your race. I felt like throwing up. Is this really what my experience is worth to others?\n\nMy thirteen year old self didn’t say anything and just hung up. I hated myself for even trusting her - of all people. His sister. I had all these thoughts swirling over me. What did I do to deserve this unfair situation? I didn’t bother anyone. I was not trying to tempt anyone. Why did it matter whether I was Mexican too? Where is Logan now? Would he come back and show up to finish what he started?\n\nSuch thoughts accompanied me all throughout my teen years. I couldn’t help it. The damage was done. I was stupid and naive. \n\nFast forward to now, I am doing much better thankfully. I’m not fully absolved from my past unwanted memories but things have indeed improved. I have loving friends and a sweet significant other. My parents are still my greatest pride. \n\nI just hope that on nights like now that my idle mind doesn’t betray me anymore. I don’t ever want to meet or let alone think of Logan or his sister again.",

    "text": "Feminism: Enabling Female Psychopaths Men and women, and gender fluid, nonbinary, persons of colour, LGBTIQ+ persons, (and definitely not privileged white men), we got a lot right in the Western world since World War 2. Two things amaze me about the organization of Western society. One, society has so effectively removed the opportunities for the psychopathic individuals to thrive with one exception. Two, that one exception is feminist psychopathy directed to men.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTeachers can't smack, gropers get caught on camera and imprisoned, there's enough prosperity that generally people have an option other than staying when their romantic partner is abusive, workplace bullying no longer flies like it used to, by and large violence between men is far less tolerated, child abuse is not kept silent about but every effort is expended in its prevention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn other words, the many 'hunting grounds' the psychopath might have previously used to express his or her disregard for the rights of others have been closed off or at least curtailed severely. However, all is not lost for the psychopath, because a new hunting ground has been opened with a numerous prey, and all one needs to be given an open season ticket to hunt is a vagina. (No, sorry MTFs, I doubt a surgically constructed one would give you full hunting rights, but you could always try).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe major thing I have noticed in the course of my life is the manner in which feminism has given massive cover for antisocial and psychopathic women to harm men. It's the only context that I'm aware of in Western societies where this 'privilege' exists. Try treating blacks, Asians, Hispanics, spastics, the blind, homosexuals, Muslims or Parsis like this, and you'll lose your job quicker than you can say, 'our company doesn't stand for discrimination'. But treat a man this way, go right ahead! Because if you are a psychopathic woman mistreating a man YOU WILL NOT FACE SOCIETY'S USUAL CENSURE AND CONDEMNATION OF SUCH BEHAVIOUR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have experienced this myself, from quite an early age in fact, although generally speaking I believe I have avoided the harsher edge of this reality. Employment is the obvious context this comes to mind - a female boss or even colleague can make hell for a male subordinate, she's got cover. If the guy were to do a tenth of that to a woman, he'd be up before HR with, 'do it again and you're out', warning at the very least. I don't know how it is in America, but in Australia my understanding is female managers are brought in directly so they can work on firing a sufficiently difficult female staff member - the male managers are scared of doing it, so will often be swapped out for the termination process. I've mostly had very good female bosses, but the behavior of some women colleagues I've dealt with (and yes, they were disproportionately lesbian) clearly indicated that they had cover AND THEY KNEW THEY HAD COVER.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the problem, women in Western society know they've got cover when they have a dispute or conflict with a man. This kind of imbalance is always a problem, it's destabilizing, but that's not what I'm talking about here, the everyday woman getting her way because she knows she can. I'm talking about the genuinely antisocial and psychopathic woman, the woman who has a genuine contempt for humanity. This is a very small subset of the human population, but they cause enormous havoc and harm. We cannot do anything, as a society, to stop a certain number of psychopaths growing to maturity every year, they are an indelible part of the tapestry of human existence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut while in the past we've often allowed them to predate because of indifference - who cares about the poor? - or fear - I'd better not criticize Stalin. I cannot think of a time, before the current state of affairs emerged somewhere in the 1990s as far as I can tell, where we have without a violent change of government given them complete cover for their actions, and in fact supported them in the very process of their psychopathic abuse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I was young in the early 1990s my older sibling, who was sometimes violent, poured boiling coffee on my back. I had to get burns treatment at the local hospital, and the young male doctor there asked me if my father had done it. No, I said, my sibling did it. He asked the question, while he treated me, about three additional times. A more suggestible kid could easily have given the answer he was so clearly fishing for. I remember years later, a fully fledge adult, I talked to a therapist. He wanted to know all about how abusive and violent my father was (somewhat abusive, virtually never violent). He sympathized, he understood. But he didn't want to hear me say anything negative about my mother, who I certainly believe had psychopathic tendencies and who has wrought mental destruction on my siblings, particularly my younger sister. At the time it didn't register, but later I started thinking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was watching a YouTube video that discussed the fact that men's rights groups were banned as student clubs on Canadian campuses. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s4sZi8zjzY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s4sZi8zjzY) here's the link. A woman and man who appeared to be from ethnic minority backgrounds argued up hill and down dale why such groups were an evil fifth column that should be banned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe woman, who appeared to be Indian Canadian, even suggested men's groups might be more acceptable if they talked about 'the real issues', such as the plight of 'men of color' and 'transgender men', and she intimated that her white fellow panelist, supportive of freedom of speech, should zip it, and, all class, she seemed to mock him being of an older generation. She and the other man who spoke in her support against men's rights - who also appeared to belong to an ethnic minority, but seemed to be motivated more by sureing up his liberal credentials for political reasons than psychopathy - hinted that 'straight white men' should put up and shut up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen there are the news reports Canada will give 95% of its foreign aid for women and girls. Well, that's nice...if you're a psychopath, and somehow find boys dying of HIV in Africa okay while girls dying of HIV in Africa not okay. Anyone who has lived in a developing country knows this is what it means, it's not some theoretical institute that spouts hatred we're talking about, it's for the basics - and the Canadian government has literally said girls' lives matter, little boys' lives don't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've heard female family court judges expressly say they love the job because they can use it to deny custody to fathers. It's not so much the fact women are helped when men aren't that disturbs me - sure, it's unfair that men don't get special teaching places reserved for them to balance the gender numbers, but women get engineering places because WE MUST have gender balanced numbers there. But what I'm talking about is seeing the malice of genuinely psychopathic women given extraordinary rein to harm and injure men, and inevitably, their girlfriends and wives and children. I have seen time and again so many feminists truly motivated more by a desire to hurt men than help women. Brett Kavanaugh, an innocent man with wife and daughters - fuck it, hurting him with disproven falsehoods is more important than considering the welfare impact of this on his wife and daughters. It is more important to hurt a man than help a woman, which would make sense to the psychopath, right, because the psychopath disregards everyone except themselves including women. It's just that the direct harm is allowed to be delivered to the man, and all well and good if the indirect harm then flows to the women in that man's life. What isn't allowed, under feminisms perverted rules, is for the harm to be directed DIRECTLY to another woman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt reminded me of what Cassie Jaye said in an interview, if I'm paraphrasing right, feminism isn't about helping women, it's about helping feminism. I'd go a step further, feminism isn't about helping women, it's about hurting men directly even if this indirectly hurts the women connected to men.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will be blunt. The majority of the most extremely hateful behavior I've seen has been from women who either openly self-identify as, or who the inferential evidence indicates are, lesbian. I've seen it from both straight and lesbian women, but I would say most of the most extreme psychopathic and antisocial behavior I have seen by women against men has been from lesbian women. I am not saying lesbian women have a greater incidence of psychopathy, I do not know if there is - or whether there would even be allowed to take place - research into this. But this is what I have seen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to leave everyone on a negative note. So I'd just like to add that this problem has gotten consistently worse over the last 20 years I have observed it and every indication is it is going to continue to get worse. There appears to be no catalyst or force to change this, and so, I would expect, an increase in psychopathic and antisocial behavior in society by a small minority of women against a lot of men.",

    "text": "The role of false accusations during the temperance movement and in the lynching of blacks in the Deep South False accusations get a lot of attention, but much less attention has been given to how false accusations have helped shape history.  For example, false accusations have often been used to push a false victimisation narrative.  And the interaction between false accusations and false victimization narratives can be found throughout history.\n\nThis kind of argument should create more sympathy for the problem given that most people (feminists and SJWs included) already accept the historical narrative around these topics.  In fact, SJWs often go to great lengths to discuss the prison disparity among black people in terms of wrongful convictions.  The fact that many of those convictions were because of false accusations (including false accusations of sexual assault) seems to go over their heads.\n\n###**Temperance (prohibition)**\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, the issue of temperance was split by gender.  Women usually supported it, and men were against it.  As a result, the early women's movement got involved.  In fact, their later support for suffrage was largely the result of their belief that women would vote in favor of prohibition (and not, for example, [in a belief that women were being oppressed](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/dxtdqd/addressing_a_few_foundational_assumptions_of/)).  Evidence for this comes from the fact that [most women who supported suffrage were against giving blacks the right to vote, including other black women](https://www.npr.org/2011/03/25/134849480/the-root-how-racism-tainted-womens-suffrage).\n\nThe main argument for temperance was that men who drank too much neglected their responsibilities to women.  A husband who drank too much would loose his job, he would neglect his children, and he would beat his wife. The narrative of female victimization was so powerful that some women [took it upon themselves to go around the country and start fights in bars](https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/women-and-the-temperance-movement).  The harm that women faced at the hands of drunk men, both real and imagined, was used to push their political narrative.\n\nOf course women eventually got their way.  Prohibition was established in 1920 and lasted for 13 years (and only ended because [women eventually changed their minds](https://books.google.com/books?id=7mc8QsyUMjAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Women's%20organization%20for%20national%20prohibition&f=false)).\n\nAnd this wouldn't be the last time that women's safety in society was used to outlaw a substance, either.\n\n###**The lynching of blacks in the Deep South**\n\nIf you were a black man living in the South, the last thing you wanted to do was get involved with a white woman.  Simply looking at a white woman could get you hung by a violent mob.  And while the lynching of blacks is usually seen as something that white men did to black men, the role of white women is often overlooked.\n\nSeveral studies reveal that white women were not only complacent in the lynching of blacks, but that they often took an active role in it. They would accuse black men of looking at them, of stalking them, and even of raping them.  Simply pointing their finger at a black man was enough to get him hung.\n\nOne prominent black woman who was alive at the time noticed this and took it upon herself to document and analyze hundreds of cases of lynchings.  What she found was that many lynchings were enabled by white women who spoke \"falsehoods\" about black men, and that most of their claims were dubious at best.  Even the judges who presided over these trials (when there even were trials) were said to know that the claims were false.\n\nHer stories can be found in *[The Red Record](https://archive.org/stream/theredrecord14977gut/14977.txt)*.  Another source on this topic is *The Killing Fields of the Deep South: The Market for Cotton and the Lynching of Blacks, 1882-1930*.  The role of feminists and the early women's movement (who at the time had close ties to the KKK), in enabling this can be found [here](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dissertations/AAI1469917/) and [here](https://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&context=constructing).\n\nIn terms of numbers, *The Red Record* found that 36% of lynchings were motivated by accusations of rape (or attempted rape).  Allegations of rape, and the safety of white women, [definitely dominated the social narrative of the time](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25119509).  And let's not forget that sexual assault is not the only crime where false accusations can be found.\n\nWhile the lynchings eventually stopped, black men are still put in jail because of racially motivated allegations.  Recently the case of the \"[central park 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park_jogger_case)\" made headlines due to the wrongful imprisonment of five young minority boys who were forced to confess to the rape of a white woman.\n\n###**The war on drugs**\n\nIt has been stated that many of our drugs laws were drawn up based on race.  White people drank alcohol and used tobacco, so that's why those substances are legal.  Black people used cocaine, and Hispanics smoked marijuana, so that's why those substances were outlawed (see: *[The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Jim_Crow)* by  Michelle Alexander).\n\nOne piece of propaganda that was particularly effective was the claim that [black people would use cocaine and then run around raping white women](http://lh.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/lh/article/download/5410/4605).\n\n###**Most of the social narrative surrounding gender to this day is shaped by a victimization narrative**\n\nEverywhere you look people are trying to manufacture a victimization narrative.  And while some issues may be more legitimate than others, many are simply made up out of convenience.  It could be stated that feminism itself relies on a false victimization narrative.  The idea that women are oppressed through a patriarchal conspiracy follows a well established pattern that doesn't seem all that out of place given the historical context (and the parallels to the neo-Nazi rhetoric of a Jewocracy oppressing white people [hasn't exactly gone unnoticed](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2018/10/dog-rape-and-mein-kampf-feminist-text-why-we-hoaxed-journals-terrible) -- see also: https://www.reddit.com/r/Menkampf).\n\nPeople aren't shy to make false accusations when it benefits them.  While the rate of false accusations of rape is debatable, there are very clear statistics that indicate the extent of this happening in [divorce and child custody cases](https://quillette.com/2019/04/16/divorce-and-the-silver-bullet/).\n\n[False accusations of child abuse](http://ohiofamilyrights.com/Reports/Special-Reports-Page-3/Sexual-Abuse-Allegations-in-Divorce-and-Custody-Disputes.pdf) occur in about 6% of child custody cases, with 33% being provably false, and another 17% being baseless. [Allegations of domestic abuse](http://www.saveservices.org/downloads/False-DV-Allegations-Cost-20-Billion) occur in 25% of cases, with 70% being false. And it's estimated that [85% to 90% of restraining orders are completely without merit](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/order-of-protection-and-j_b_974970).\n\n[Most perpetrators of false accusations are women, and most victims are men](https://leb.fbi.gov/articles/featured-articles/false-allegations-of-adult-crimes) (about 80% of cases), and this contrasts strikingly against the fact that [women are just as abusive against men as the reverse](https://domesticviolenceresearch.org/domestic-violence-facts-and-statistics-at-a-glance/), [women rape men at a similar rate as the reverse](http://webshare.law.ucla.edu/Faculty/bibs/stemple/Stemple-SexualVictimizationPerpetratedFinal.pdf), and [women abuse children at greater rates than men](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16165212).\n\n###Why is the victimization narrative so successful?\n\nHumans have a biological imperative to listen to, and help women.  [Study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15491274) after [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1948550616647448) after [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5112287/) demonstrates how strong of a bias this is.  When a woman needs something, it is almost always the case that a man will get it for her.\n\nA man can claim a victimization status all he wants, but he will never get the same amount of attention that a woman would.  That's why you don't find as many men making false accusations as you do women.\n\nIn a lot of ways, the use of a victimization narrative to grant privileges to women is just a reflection of society acting this way in aggregate. And again, there are [studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103118304633) and [more studies](https://ideas.repec.org/p/hhs/nhheco/2019_006.html) indicating that this is likely the case.\n\nMany issues that men face in society are caused by this phenomenon. Men receive far less empathy than women do. And men are pushed aside, and are often harmed, to advance the privileges of women.\n\nAs such, the phenomenon of false allegations should be viewed through the wider lense of \"manufactured victimization\".  Its relationship to the empathy gap is also obvious, and that makes it a major force behind the wider persecution of men in society.",
