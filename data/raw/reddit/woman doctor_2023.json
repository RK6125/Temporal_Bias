    "text": "My mom's boss is texting to write my mom's two week notice Let me just say, I don't work with either my mom or her manager. For a few months now, my mom has been verbally harassed by her boss via text and in person. My mom is an assistant manager, second in command to this woman. Every time something goes wrong at their work whether it be other employees mistakes or customers complaining, my mom's boss takes it out on her by saying as an assistant my mom should be on top of these things, etc. Her boss even sends my mom text at night (non-working hours) with long paragraphs complaining about getting yelled at by the supervisor (her boss's boss) for the other employees negligence or other things and how my mom is not doing her job right. My mom's boss has been known to send text after text to other managers. To my my knowledge, there has been at least one other person who has complained about her to the supervisor. I feel like she's a classic Karen. Her text messages often go on as follows: Who did X, Y, and Z? -no replies- Hello? Is it so hard to answer? What you guys do is not right. It is not protocol, etc.\n\nMy mom literally went to the doctor last-last Saturday because she had a terrible headache. My mom had brain cancer a few years ago and has since then been in remission. So it's always a scare when headaches arise. We went to the doctor. She got a note for 2 days of rest. She let her boss know but her boss sent her a long message in responds saying she \"needs her days off because she enjoys them and my mom can't just suddenly fall sick because she wants to relax.\" My mom did not respond and contacted a supervisor. The text messages stopped at that point.\n\nTonight at 7:30PM I got a long text message from my mom's boss. She said she couldn't contact my dad because she respects him and that she feels like I should know her side of the story. She goes on to telling me her recollection of how the events from the past few months gone with my mom. She told me as an adult I should know what is right and wrong by now? And then she insisted I needed to write my mom's two week notice, that she needed it by tomorrow so she and my mom can move on. She thinks my mom should retire so my mom's boss can continue working. She even said in her text that \"I need to help the two of them should move on from this.\" I haven't replied. She even questioned marked the text at 7:50PM after sending it because I haven't responded.\n\nI'm not sure what to do?\n\n[UPDATE] (https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/17bdas0/update_my_moms_boss_is_texting_to_write_my_moms/)",

    "text": "Was I Discriminated Against? I was fired from a corporate job.\n\nI came into work sick. I was sitting at my desk with my head resting on my arm. I have a standing desk that was adjusted to be a little too high, so that I was close to eye level with the computer screen even though I was resting on my arm. There is a nosy busybody HR woman in our building. She saw me. A few days later she called me up to her office and accused me of sleeping at my desk. I maintain that I wasn't.\n\nShe asked questions of a personal medical nature. Like she wanted an explanation of why I would be sleeping at my desk. I mentioned that I was dealing with some medical issues. I have a serious medical condition that can cause fatigue and poor sleep. She asked for a note from the doctor to explain why I would be sleeping at work. I asked the doctor to keep my personal medical info to a minimum. My doctor provided a note that said I was under his care for a medical condition. She said that the note was inadequate and asked for another. I emphasized that I did not want to share my personal medical information with them, but I would ask my doctor for another note to do what they asked. My doctor provided a second note that added that I might need accommodations for sick days, and appointments. My manager claimed that it was actually some higher level corporate HR department that needed the note, but I strongly suspect that he was full of shit.\n\nToday, she called me up to her office, said the second doctors note was inadequate and that I did not comply. She said that HR checked my time ticket against the hours logged in the room by the badge scanner, and accused me of cheating on my time ticket. They refused to provide any further info, and walked me out of the building.\n\nI believe that my time ticket was reasonably accurate and that any discrepancies would be explained by bathroom breaks or whatever. I know that time tickets have a reputation for being used as a justification to fire people for BS reasons.\n\nI believe that I was fired because I argued with the HR lady about my personal medical information and she interpreted it as a challenge to her authority and lack of deference.\n\nI suspect that I would still have a job if I kept my mouth shut and didn't mention medical stuff. Did they break the law and how would I prove it?\n\nEDIT:\n\nShe asked me if I was ok twice. The first time I didn't respond. She did not tap me on the shoulder or try to wake me up, or interact with me in any way. The second time I did respond and said I was fine. I maintain that I wasn't sleeping, because I do not talk in my sleep.\n\nAlso, I believe that the second doctors note fulfilled their requirements.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nI had an employee evaulation a few weeks ago. no issues with time tickets or sleeping were reported on my review. My manager did tell me that I was going outside of core hours (9 am-3 pm) too often. I replied that it was because of doctors appointments and tests, and that I would be more consistent in the future.",

    "text": "Please give me some advice on what job I can get I am a completely passable 17-years old trans girl, but I live in a small town in Bulgaria. People here are beyond terrible. I have some skills that could be useful - I  have a good knowledge of English and I have been learning Spanish and Polish for a very long time. I have a 10th grde certificate (which is the mandatory level of higher education here) and I passed with 6:00 (which is the maximum grade you could have here). I invest incredibly much time for my education and my school is considered the best in town (although I am in a science class and I am pretty sure this will not help me as I don't have a university degree). I have been on hormones since 2021 but I have been doing it DIY as most doctors here are confused and think that I am mentally ill. I have gone through a lot of abuse and I feel like I can't take it anymore. Wherever I go and show my ID, people tell me to give it back to my boyfriend (which I don't have) or something similarly idiotic. Everyone is so nice and I am so beautiful, smart, charming, caring as they say, until they find out I am not cis. Then I am a monster which is completely unworthy to be on earth. Even though people are supposed to be respectful and professional while doing their job, they really aren't here. I don't feel like if I went to a random shop and asked to be a cashier, they would be remotely welcoming (It's impossible to change my documents now, therefore I would have to explain the whole thing). I know that the more I try, the better the chance but I am scared to do it even once. I just don't have the courage to go and be humiliated while knowing that it is going to happen as it has been the case with innumerous things so far. I am completely dedicating my energy to leave this horror. I understand that having a job is a huge part of this whole thing and I would like to ask if anyone knows what I could work. I am keen on having an online job but most things seem to be scams. If this is not an option, please tell me how to explain that I am a trans woman to hostile people. Any advice would be very much appreciated.\n\nSorry that it became so long and thanks for your time ❤️",

    "text": "I went to a Texas ER yesterday. It was bad. tl;dr - Title\n\nYesterday I went to a Dallas, TX ER. About ten minutes after I woke up that morning I collapsed as sudden, sharp, pain started spreading from my lower left abdomen. It was *excruciating*. I have a very high pain tolerance, and I couldn't speak, or stand up, or walk. All I could do was writhe and cry and vomit in agony. I've had an ovarian torsion that required surgery before, as well as several instances of ruptured ovarian cysts that caused full-on internal bleeding. This felt like that.\n\nMy husband called 911 for an ambulance, as he did not believe he could get me safely to the car and drive with me in that condition.\n\nThe EMTs wouldn't even look at me and clearly didn't want to take me to the hospital. You see - we just moved, and the neighborhood is poor. I have 'locked hair, piercings, and tattoos and I wasn't obviously gushing blood from something like a gunshot wound. They quite clearly assumed I was faking and drug-seeking.\n\nAnd the rest of the day got no better.\n\nThese medical professionals let me writhe in agony for well over an hour while they grilled me about whether I was pregnant or not, over and over. Ironically - I'd actually really love to have another baby, but I had to be surgical sterilized (cauterized tubes) for my own safety over a decade ago. AND I haven't had sex in six months, which my husband confirmed for them at my bedside. None of those facts, or that trauma mattered to them. They angrily demanded that I *stand up* and go do their piss-test. I had to remind them, nearly screaming, that I couldn't stand up or walk and they begrudgingly and resentfully got me a bedpan.\n\nAll my blood and urine work came back clean because *of course it did*. I am not pregnant, and I wasn't on any illicit substances.\n\nThey did finally, at this point, provide a small amount of pain relief.\n\nThey did an ultrasound. They CT'd my abdomen.\n\nAnd much later an exasperated male doctor comes back to tell me I have a UTI. I know my body - this was *not* solely a UTI. I said as much, and restated my history.\n\nFriends, I shit you not, this is what he said to me (pissily):\n\n\"Well, *yes*, we found ruptured hemorrhagic cysts on your ovaries. And *I guess maybe* that could've caused your pain. I don't know. But there's no way to be sure. There's nothing we can do for you - we're discharging you.\"\n\nAs you might imagine - I have concerns at this point. I've been through this before, and both the internal bleeding and the recovery pain are things I wanted clearly addressed by the staff before I left.\n\nDespite my pain and the medication, I was calm and very polite as I tried to ask my questions. The doctor just walked away. And when I tried to ask my nurse she literally wouldn't stop interrupting me to talk over me. When my husband asked her why she wouldn't let me speak, she literally threw up her hands and said she wasn't going to talk to us anymore and walked out. I was discharged, and I needed to *fucking leave*.\n\nWhen my husband asked for a Patient Advocate, no one would acknowledge the request or even look at him. We didn't get a patient advocate, despite asking multiple times.\n\nThere was nothing to do but leave. Despite my medical history, proof of currently rupturing cysts on my ovaries, and clean drug tests - they still treated me like an addict using them to get high. And the second I wasn't pregnant, they didn't give a single flying fuck. I was a living incubator, or a drug addict, or both. And they didn't let me be anything else - I couldn't just be a person in crisis who needed help.\n\nThey didn't even note the ruptured cysts they found on my discharge paperwork - just the UTI.\n\nI don't want to hear excuses about the pandemic or worker burnout. It simply *isn't* an excuse. If you can't do your job without punching down on sick people *it's on you to find a new job*. Period.\n\nThe woman who personally performed my ultrasound, and the gentleman who directly performed my CT were both kind, empathetic people who obviously did their best. Being decent is clearly still possible.\n\nNo one else chose to be decent yesterday at DALLAS REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER.\n\nI would tell you all to please be safe, but I don't really know how that's possible all things considered. Be aware, if nothing else, of how little you matter to these people.\n\nEdited to add: We have insurance, so that certainly wasn't the issue here.\n\nEdit #2: I can't see *any* comments left in the last 45 minutes or so you guys. I get phone notifications, and nothing is there, though the comment count continues to go up. From what little research I've done, it looks like A TON of comments may be being moderated, or auto-moderated. I'm not sure why, as I can't see the full comments but what little I can see doesn't look rule breaking. I appreciate the guidance, I just wish I could actually see it. Do the mods have any insight, here?\n\nUpdate: From the mods (thank you!) - \"Some comments are removed for moderator approval.

    "text": "Today my doctor said the quiet part out loud I contracted Covid in Dec. 2021; lost my taste, had to go on an inhaler, the whole deal. Since then I’ve been having disconcerting health issues that my doctor is trying to get to the bottom of. I’m scheduled for testing with the best autonomic disorders team in the country next month after what will be 7 months of waiting. I’ve got an appointment with a rheumatologist to see why I’ve suddenly developed what seems to be Reynaud’s, and I was referred to a cardiologist for chest pain and exercise intolerance. \n\nNow the cardiologist had the shortest wait times for appointments and when I saw him in February, he told me I was too young (36) for heart problems and  it was probably GERD. So he gave me some proton pump inhibitors then told me to come back in three months. Obviously they didn’t help. \n\nToday when I went and saw my primary care doctor for my annual physical, she was looking over my cardiologist’s notes and got so upset. She gave me a list of demands for when I follow up with them and told me that if I were a man of my age with these symptoms and family history, they would have done serious testing as soon as they saw me, but since I’m a woman, they’re brushing it off. \n\nI’m so relieved to finally have someone who is taking my concerns seriously after having to switch providers because they kept telling me that I just have anxiety. Since you know, anxiety frequently causes you to turn blue and almost pass out in hot showers.",

    "text": "Nonconsensual pelvic exams are STILL HAPPENING in teaching hospitals across the US. TW: SA\n\nThis topic gained a lot of traction a few years back, but has since faded into the background without many changes being made. Some states have stepped up, but many others have failed.\n\nImagine checking into the hospital for a procedure on your leg. You’re put under anesthesia, and while you’re out, an entire rotation of med students get to practice performing a vaginal exam on you. You were never informed, never consented, and in most cases, you never find out.\n\nThe thought process of the doctors who do this is that students need a way to learn these procedures and you never know it happened to you, so no harm no foul, right? \n\nWrong. Just read about [this case](https://www.healthywomen.org/amp/pelvic-exams-unconscious-women-2652781553) where the woman *woke up* during her non-consensual pelvic exam. Or [this woman](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/health/pelvic-medical-exam-unconscious.html), who after specifically requesting no medical students be involved in her procedure had one nonchalantly tell her she had gotten her period. \n\nThis practice is not only a complete violation of the patient’s human rights, it’s also potentially dangerous if the hospital doesn’t have her complete OBGYN notes and records. Imagine this happening to a woman with vaginismus, who is now terrified and confused as to why after a procedure on her ear she’s experiencing soreness and discomfort in her vaginal area. \n\nIt’s why I avoid teaching hospitals at all costs, despite living near one of the best ones in the country. I advise any woman not living in one of [these states](https://www.epsteinprogram.com/states-banning-unauthorized-pelvic-exams) who will listen to do the same. \n\nAlso, give this [recent news piece](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/show/why-more-states-are-requiring-consent-for-pelvic-exams-on-unconscious-patients) a watch. It has some great up to date info about the ongoing fight to have this practice made illegal.\n\nETA: If you’re ever having a life-threatening emergency, please don’t let this deter you from going to a teaching hospital if that’s the closest one! If you’re having a true medical emergency, I don’t think they will take the time to do unnecessary procedures or exams over saving your life.\n\nEdit 2: To clear up some confusion, this *does* actually happen to men as well for prostate exams. It’s just not nearly as common.",

    "text": "Told my surgeon that I did NOT consent to any pelvic exams while under anesthesia, and her response really rubs me the wrong way. !ATTENTION!\n\nTHIS PRACTICE IS LEGAL IN 29 STATES. CHECK IF IT'S LEGAL IN YOURS.\n\nA few days ago, I had to get a colostomy bag put in. The entire process was basically speedran--my colorectal surgeon took a look at the situation while I was under anesthesia and promptly scheduled me for a bag. I probably would be dead if I had to wait too long (she was pale in the face and astounded I hadn't collapsed weeks ago). In no time, I was admitted to a hospital as an emergency case the day after the examination. No one was more ready for this surgery than me.\n\nSo I'm in the final waiting room before the OR, waiting for everything to get ready so I can be wheeled back and put under. My colorectal surgeon walks in, along with a younger woman in scrubs who doesn't say a thing. My surgeon introduces her as a med student who's going to watch. And instantly, I freak out.\n\nIf you don't know, in the USA, women can and often will be subjected to nonconsensual pelvic examinations during procedures where they're knocked out. You don't have to be doing a vaginal surgery, either. Without telling you, doctors can use you as a guinea pig for med students to practice exams on. This happens more than you think, is legal in more states than you think, and is completely abhorrent and inhumane. Luckily, I checked if they can do that in the state where I was having surgery, and it's been illegal as of 2019. And this is a very blue state. But seeing the med student put me into a panic, so I immediately clarified that this colostomy procedure was the only one I consented to, no pelvic exams, nothing but what I came here for.\n\nMy surgeon gave me a baffled look like I was an idiot and said in a manner that'd make you think she followed it up with a hearty \"Duh, dumbass!\": \n\n\"But how else are they going to learn?\" \n\nI'd understand if she was like, \"You're too anxious. We don't do that here.\" Or better yet, just a \"We won't do it.\" But instead, I have the audacity to request people don't stick their fingers into my genitalia when there's nothing wrong and I wasn't there for it. I shouldn't have to ask NOT to have something done to me that wasn't discussed. \n\nIn the same tone, I just replied, \"But I don't consent.\"\n\nI will fucking die on this hill. What the hell do you mean, practice? You don't normally perform pelvic exams on unconscious people. How the hell are you supposed to know you're truly doing it properly if your patient can't tell you if that hurts, and if they're not even aware of it! \n\nI had to go to an OBGYN semi recently, and they told me I very likely had a rectovaginal fistula, AKA basically a hole between the rectum and vagina. Granted, the doctors suspect it's fairly far up--could actually be in my uterus--so maybe a med student might not accidentally come across it. But can you imagine if I got injured because of carelessness? How am I even supposed to know what went wrong and that it really is an injury if no one told me they were sticking their fingers in there?\n\nAnd yes, I know med students aren't incompetent, but what if they were too rough or careless? What if they tore me? I've been manhandled by medical professionals before. People aren't careful 100% of the time, especially when the patient can't provide feedback. Also, I was sexually abused as a child. \n\nEven if someone gave me a flawless, beautiful pelvic exam and I'd never know about it, I SHOULD NOT AS AN ADULT RECEIVE MEDICAL TREATMENT WITHOUT MY CONSENT AND KNOWLEDGE. I am not a fucking medical cadaver! I'm not a test dummy! I'm not a guinea pig, and I am most certainly NOT just a walking vagina who can be prodded and poked by medical equipment, my own feelings be damned! \n\nWomen are treated like shit in the states. We have a long way to go before women are considered as more than medical props for doctors.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: I was NOT given a nonconsensual pelvic exam during this latest surgery. I don't know if I've ever been given one. My disgust comes from her statement, not anything she did to me that day. Also, she wasn't planning on doing anything to me. I forgot my mom remarked about how I watched the news too much, and I told her that this happens in a lot of places and it's disgusting and shouldn't be done. THAT is what my surgeon responded to, hence why she said \"How else will THEY learn\" as opposed to SHE, which would signify the med student.\n\nEDIT TWO: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO\n\nFor those who say I overreacted: Yeah, you're right. My panic got the best of me. I have medical trauma, anxiety in general, and FND, so my ability to stay calm momentarily went out the window. For the record, my surgeon isn't kind, but she isn't evil or a psychopath. I'm 100% sure she wasn't going to give me an EUA--it is illegal in the state, she has no reason to do one (and wouldn't want to touch me more than she has to because I'm in such bad shape), and she wasn't the only one in the OR anyway, so why would she risk her job? She wouldn't. \n\nHowever, I can't help but get kinda pissed over people who telling me I'm spreading misinformation. I'm not. It does happen. According to doctors in the comments, less frequently now, and thank God for that. I'm not in every OR to see just how often this gets done. I even considered taking this post down, but no. There are medical professionals who are claiming that this just doesn't happen.\n\nYes, it does. Maybe not all the time or in every hospital, but it does. Making such a bold claim that it doesn't happen is insulting and ridiculous, and another example of doctors not listening to women's experiences. If it doesn't happen, then why is it legal in so many places?

But I have reported him and I have an appointment with another (female) doctor that I booked through a private practice. \n\n\n\nSo, I have a growth in my stomach. I found out about it because it hurts when I press on the location and I had several ultrasounds and appointments with different doctors who confirmed.\nThe diagnosis right now is a cyst and all of the doctors I went to were concerned since apparently cysts aren't supposed to hurt.\n\nI always try to go to women doctors, not only gynecologists but every doctor I need to visit. Anyways I went to see a surgeon- he was supposed to decide the treatment plan, My g.p said the she believes he will choose a non invasive surgery since, again, it hurts.\n\nThis surgeon basically told me that I am hysterical, that I made that up, that I have no idea what I'm talking about. He refused to look at the documents I brought including the ultrasound which shows the growth and he didn't let me talk. He also used my name alot like those creeps on tinder like \"show me where you think it hurts, OP\" or \"no, OP, this is probably psychological\".\n\nThe appointment lasted for less then 10 minutes and I just sat there and held my tears back. My mom was waiting for me outside and when we got out I started crying so hard that I could not talk and all I said is \"he didn't believe me\".\n\nAfter I calmed down and thought about it all i felt lucky that I had other doctors that cared about me and that I had proof that I'm not lying but after seeing how easy it is to dismiss a woman's pain like that I feel like I lost alot of trust in doctors, especially men doctors.\n\nI guess I needed the vent, thank you ❤️",

    "text": "The Chen 2023 Paper Raises Serious Concerns About Pediatric Gender Medicine Outcomes When I started my Child and Adolescent Psychiatry training in the 2010s, the diagnosis and treatment of gender dysphoria were rapidly becoming controversial in the field. Doctors and nurses who had spent decades on inpatient adolescent units, usually seeing one gender dysphoric child every 4-5 years, now saw multiple transgender-identifying kids in every inpatient cohort. It was a rare patient list that did not include at least one teenager with pronouns not matching their sex.\r  \n \r  \nViewpoints about this differed, with every student, resident, fellow, and attending having their own perspective. All of us wanted what was best for patients, and these discussions were always productive and collegial. While I am not naive about how heated this topic can be online, I have only ever had good experiences discussing it with my colleagues. Some of my attendings thought that this was merely a social fad, similar to Multiple Personality Disorder or other trendy diagnoses, like the rise in Tourette's and other tic disorders seen during the early pandemic and widely attributed to social media. Others, including myself early on, thought we were merely seeing psychological education doing what it is supposed to do: patients who would, in earlier decades, not realize they were transgender until middle age were now gaining better psychological insight during their teen years. This was due to a combination of increased tolerance and awareness of transgender people and was a positive good that shouldn't necessarily raise any red flags or undue skepticism.\r  \n \r  \nDuring my outpatient fellowship year, I began to suspect a combination of both theories could be true, similar to ADHD or autism, where increasing rates of diagnosis likely reflected some combination of better cultural awareness (good) and confirmation bias leading to dubious diagnoses (bad). Confirmation bias is always a problem in psychiatric diagnosis, because almost all psychiatric diagnoses describe symptoms that exist along a spectrum, so almost anyone could meet the DSM5TR criteria for any condition, so long as you ignored the severity of the symptom, and people are often not good at judging the severity of their own symptoms, as they do not know what is \"normal\" in the broader population.\r  \n \r  \nI considered myself moderate on these issues. Every field of medicine faces a tradeoff between overtreatment and undertreatment, and I shared the worries of some of my more trans-affirming colleagues that many of these kids were at high risk for suicide if not given the treatment they wanted. Even if you attribute the increase in trans-identification among teens to merely a social fad, it was a social fad with real dangers. If an influencer or spiritual guru on social media was convincing teens that evil spirits could reside in their left ring finger, and they needed to amputate this finger or consider suicide, the ethical argument could be made that providing these finger amputations was a medically appropriate trade of morbidity for mortality. \"How many regretted hormonal treatments, breast surgeries, or (in our hypothetical) lost ring fingers are worth one life saved from suicide?\" is a reasonable question, even if you are skeptical of the underlying diagnosis.\r  \n \r  \nAnd I was always skeptical of the legitimacy of most teenagers' claims to be transgender, if for no other reason than because gender dysphoria was historically a rare diagnosis, and the symptoms they described could be better explained by other diagnoses. As the old medical proverb says, \"when you hear hoofbeats, think horses and not zebras.\" The DSM5 estimated the prevalence of gender dysphoria in males as a range from 0.005% to 0.014%, and in females as a range of 0.002% to 0.003%, although the newer DSM5TR rightly notes the methodological limitations of such estimates.\r  \n \r  \nRegardless, most of the symptoms these teens described could be explained as identity disturbance (as in borderline personality disorder and some trauma responses), social relationship problems (perhaps due to being on the autism spectrum), body image problems (similar to and sometimes comorbid with eating disorders), rigid thinking about gender roles (perhaps due to OCD or autism), unspecified depression and anxiety, or just gender nonconforming behavior that fell within the normal range of human variation. It seems highly implausible that the entire field of psychiatry had overlooked or missed such high rates of gender dysphoria for so long. Some of my colleagues tried to explain this as being due to the stigma of being transgender, but I do not think it is historically accurate to say that psychiatry as a field has been particularly prudish or hesitant to discuss sex and gender. In 1909 Sigmund Freud published a case report about \"Little Hans,\" which postulated that a 5-year-old boy was secretly fixated on horse penis because of the size of the organ. I do not find it plausible that the next century of psychoanalysis somehow underestimated the true rate of gender dysphoria by multiple orders of magnitude because they were squeamish about the topic. In fact, the concept that young girls secretly wanted a penis was so well known that the term \"penis envy\" entered common English vocabulary! Of course, the psychoanalytic concept of penis envy is not gender dysphoria per se, but it is adjacent enough to demonstrate the implausibility of the notion that generations of psychoanalysts downplayed or ignored the true rate of gender dysphoria due to personal bigotry or cultural taboo.\r  \n \r  \nTherefore, for most of my career I have been in the odd position of doubting my gender-affirming colleagues, who would say \"trans kids know who they are\" and talk about saving lives from suicide, but also believing that they were making the best of a difficult situation. In the absence of any hard outcome data, all we had to argue about was theory and priors. I routinely saw adverse outcomes from these treatments, both people who regretted transitioning and those whose dysphoria and depression kept getting worse the more they altered their bodies, but I had to admit this might be selection bias, as presumably the success cases didn't go on to see other psychiatrists. I could be privately skeptical, but without any hard data there was no public argument to make. The gender affirming clinicians claimed that they could correctly identify which kinds of gender dysphoria required aggressive treatment (from DSMIV-TR to DSM5 the diagnosis was changed to emphasize and require identification with the opposite gender, rather than other kinds of gendered distress and nonconformity), and even when they were wrong they were appropriately trading a risk of long term morbidity for short term mortality. There was nothing to be done except wait for the eventual long term outcomes data.\r  \n \r  \nThe waiting ended when I read the paper \"Psychosocial Functioning in Transgender Youth after 2 Years of Hormones\" by Chen et al in the NEJM. This is the second major study of gender affirming hormones (GAH) in modern pediatric populations, after Tordoff 2022, and it concluded \"GAH improved appearance congruence and psychosocial functioning.\" The authors report the outcomes as positive: \"appearance congruence, positive affect, and life satisfaction increased, and depression and anxiety symptoms decreased.\" To a first approximation, this study would seem to support gender affirming care. Some other writers have criticized the unwarranted causal language of the conclusion, as there was no control group and so it would have been more accurate to say \"GAH was associated with improvements\" rather than \"GAH improved,\" but this is a secondary issue.\r  \n \r  \nThe problem with Chen 2023 isn't its methodological limitations. The problem is its methodological strength. Properly interpreted, it is a negative study of outcomes for youth gender medicine, and its methodology is reasonably strong for this purpose (most of the limitations tilt in favor of a positive finding, not a negative one). Despite the authors' conclusions, an in-depth look at the data they collected reveals this as a failed trial. The authors gave 315 teenagers cross-sex hormones, with lifelong implications for reproductive and sexual health, and by their own outcome measures there was no evidence of meaningful clinical benefit.\r  \n \r  \n315 subjects, ages 12-20, were observed for 2 years, completing 5 scales (one each for appearance, depression, and anxiety, and then two components of an NIH battery for positive affect and life satisfaction) every 6 months including at baseline. The participants were recruited at 4 academic sites as part of the Trans Youth Care in United States (TYCUS) study. Despite the paper's abstract claiming positive results, with no exceptions mentioned, the paper itself admits that life satisfaction, anxiety and depression scores did not improve in male-to-female cases. The authors suggest this may be due to the physical appearance of transwomen, writing \"estrogen mediated phenotypic changes can take between 2 and 5 years to reach their maximum effect,\" but this is in tension with the data they just presented, showing that the male-to-female cases improved in appearance congruence significantly. The rating scale they used is reported as an average of a Likert scale (1 for strong disagreement, 3 for neutral, and 5 for strong agreement) for statements like \"My physical body represents my gender identity\" and so a change from 3 (neutral) to 4 (positive) is a large effect.\r  \n \r  \nIf a change from 3 out of 5 to 4 out of 5 is not enough to change someone's anxiety and depression, this is problematic both because the final point on the scale may not make a difference and because it may not be achievable. Other studies using the Transgender Congruence Scale, such as Ascha 2022 (\"Top Surgery and Chest Dysphoria Among Transmasculine and Nonbinary Adolescents and Young Adults\") show a score of only 3.72 for female-to-male patients 3 months after chest masculinization. (The authors report sums instead of averages, but it is trivial to convert the 33.50 given in Table 2 because we know TCS-AC has 9 items.) The paper that developed this scale, Kozee 2012, administered it to over 300 transgender adults and only 1 item (the first) had a mean over 3.\r  \n \r  \nThese numbers raise the possibility that the male-to-female cases in Chen 2023 may already be at their point of maximal improvement on the TCS-AC scale. A 4/5 score for satisfaction with personal appearance may be the best we can hope for in any population. While non-trans people score a 4.89 on this scale (according to Iliadis 2020), that doesn't mean that a similar score is realistically possible for trans people. When a trans person responds to this scale, they are essentially reporting their satisfaction with their appearance, while a non-trans person is answering questions about a construct (gender identity) they probably don't care about, which means you can't make an apples-to-apples comparison of the scores. If this is counter-intuitive to you, consider that a polling question like \"Are you satisfied with your knowledge of Japanese?\" would result in near-perfect satisfaction scores for those in the general public who have no interest in Japanese (knowledge and desire are matched near zero), but lower scores in students of the Japanese language. Even the best student will probably never reach the 5/5 satisfaction-due-to-apathy of the non-student.\r  \n \r  \nI am frustrated by the authors' decision not to be candid about the negative male-to-female results in the abstract, which is all most people (including news reporters) will be able to read. I have seen gender distressed teenagers with their parents in the psychiatric ER, and many of them are high functioning enough to read and be aware of these studies. While some teens want to transition for personal reasons, regardless of the outcomes data, in much the same way that an Orthodox Jew might want to be circumcised regardless of health benefits, others are in distress and are looking for an evidence-based answer. In the spring of 2023, I had a male-to-female teen in my ER for suicidal ideation, and patient and mother both expressed hopefulness about recently started hormonal treatment, citing news coverage of the paper. This teen had complicated concerns about gender identity, but was explicitly starting hormones to treat depression, and it is unclear whether they would have wanted such treatment without news reporting on Chen 2023.\r  \n \r  \nMoving on to the general results, the authors quantify mental health outcomes as: \"positive affect \\[had an\\] annual increase on a 100-point scale \\[of\\] 0.80 points...life satisfaction \\[had an\\] annual increase on a 100-point scale \\[of\\] 2.32 points...We observed decreased scores for depression \\[with an\\] annual change on a 63-point scale \\[of\\] −1.27 points...and decreased \\[anxiety scores\\] annual change on a 100-point scale \\[of\\] −1.46 points...over a period of 2 years of GAH treatment.\" These appear to be small effects, but interpreting quantitative results on mental health scales can be tricky, so I will not say that these results are necessarily too small to be clinically meaningful, but because there is no control group these results are small enough to raise concerns about whether GAH outperforms placebo. It is unfortunate that it is not always straightforward to compare depression treatments due to several scales being in common use, but we can see the power of the placebo effect in other clinical trials on depression. In the original clinical trials for Trintellix, a scale called MADRS was used for depression, which is scored out of 60 points, and most enrolled patients had an average depression score from 31-34. Placebo reduced this score by 10.8 to 14.5 points within 8 weeks (see Table 4, page 21 of FDA label). For Auvelity, another newer antidepressant, the placebo group's depression on the same scale fell from 33.2 to 21.1 after 6 weeks (see Figure 3 of page 21 of FDA label).\r  \n \r  \nI won't belabor the point, but anyone familiar with psychiatric research will be aware that placebo effects can be very large, and they occur across multiple diagnoses, including surprising ones like schizophrenia (see Figure 3 of the FDA label for Caplyta). I am genuinely surprised and confused by how minimal this cohort's response to treatment was. Early in my career I thought we were trading the risk of transition regret for great short-term benefit, and I was confused when I noticed how patients given GAH didn't seem to get better. This data confirms my experience is not a fluke. I could go in depth about their anxiety results, which on a hundred-point scale fell by less than 3 points after two years, but this would read nearly identically to the paragraph above.\r  \n \r  \nA more formal analysis of this paper might try to estimate the effects of psychotherapy and subtract them away from the reported benefits of GAH, and an even more sophisticated analysis might try to tease apart the benefits of testosterone for gender dysphoria per se from its more general impact on mood, but I think this is unnecessary given the very small effects reported and the placebo concerns documented above. Putting biological girls on testosterone is conceptually similar to giving men anabolic steroids, and I remain genuinely surprised that it wasn't more beneficial for their mood in the short term. Some men on high doses of male steroids are euphoric to the point of mania.\r  \n \r  \nBut my biggest concerns with this paper are in the protocol. This paper was part of TYCUS, the Trans Youth Care in United States study, and the attached protocol document, containing original (2016) and revised (2021) versions explains that acute suicidality was an exclusion criterion for this study (see section 4.6.4). There were two deaths by suicide in this study, and 11 reports of suicidal ideation, out of 315 participants, and these patients showed no evidence of being suicidal when the study began. This raises the possibility of iatrogenic harm. It would be beneficial to have more data on the suicidality of this cohort, but the next problem is that the authors did not report this data, despite collecting it according to their protocol document.\r  \n \r  \nThe 5 reported outcome measures in Chen 2023 are only a small fraction of the original data collected. The authors also assessed suicidality, Gender Dysphoria per se (not merely appearance congruence), body esteem and body image (two separate scales), service utilization, resiliency and other measures. This data is missing from the paper. I do not fully understand why the NEJM allowed such a selective reporting of the data, especially regarding the adverse suicide events. A Suicidal Ideation Scale with 8 questions was administered according to both the original and revised protocol. In a political climate where these kinds of treatments are increasingly viewed with hostility and new regulatory burdens, why would authors, who often make media appearances on this topic, hide positive results? It seems far more plausible that they are hiding evidence of harm.\r  \n \r  \nOf course, Chen 2023 is not the only paper ever published on gender medicine, but aside from Tordoff 2022 it is nearly the only paper in modern teens to attempt to measure mental health outcomes. The Ascha 2022 paper on chest masculinization surgery I mentioned above uses as its primary outcome a rating scale called the Chest Dysphoria Measure (CDM), a scale that almost any person without breasts would have a low score on (with the possible exception of the rare woman who specifically wants to have prominent and large breasts that others will notice and comment on in non-sexual contexts), even if they experienced no mental health benefits from the breast removal surgery and regretted it. Only the first item (\"I like looking at my chest in the mirror\") measures personal satisfaction. Other items, such as \"Physical intimacy/sexual activity is difficult because of my chest\" may be able to detect harm in a patient who strongly regrets the surgery but is worded in such a way as not to detect actual benefit. They should have left it at \"Physical intimacy/sexual activity is difficult\" because a person without breasts can't experience dysphoria or functional impairment as a result of having breasts, even if their overall functionality and gender dysphoria are unchanged. Gender dysphoria that is focused on breasts may simply move to hips or waist after the breasts are removed.\r  \n \r  \nTordoff 2022 was an observational cohort study of 104 teens, with 7 on some kind of hormonal treatment for gender dysphoria at the beginning of the study and 69 being on such treatment by the end. The authors measured depression on the PHQ-9 scale at 3, 6, and 12 months, and reported \"60% lower odds of depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality among youths who had initiated PBs or GAHs compared with youths who had not.\" This paper is widely cited as evidence for GAH, but the problem is that the treatment group did not actually improve. The authors are making a statistical argument that relies on the \"no treatment\" group getting worse. This would be bad enough by itself, but the deeper problem is that the apparent worsening of the non-GAH group can be explained by dropout effects. There were 35 teens not on GAH at the end of the study, but only 7 completed the final depression scale.\r  \n \r  \nThe data in eTable 3 of the supplement is helpful. At the beginning the 7 teens on GAH and the 93 not on GAH have similar scores: 57-59% meeting depression criteria and 43-45% positive for self-harming or suicidal thoughts. There is some evidence of a temporary benefit from GAH at 3 months, when the 43 GAH teens were at 56% and 28% for depression and suicidality respectively, and the 38 non-GAH teens at 76% and 58%. At 6 months the 59 GAH teens and 24 non-GAH teens are both around 56-58% and 42-46% for depression and suicidality. At 12 months there appears to be a stark worsening of the non-GAH group, with 86% meeting both depression and suicidality criteria. However, this is because 6/7 = 86% and there are only 7 subjects reporting data out of the 35 not on GAH from the original 104 subject cohort. The actual depression rate for the GAH group remains stable around 56% throughout the study, and the rate of suicidality actually worsens from Month 3 to Month 12.\r  \n \r  \nWe cannot assume that the remaining 7 are representative of the entire untreated 35. I suspect teens dropped out of this study because their gender dysphoria improved in its natural course, as many adolescent symptoms, identities and other concerns do. However, even if you disagree with me on this point, the question you have to ask about the Tordoff study is why these 7 teens would go to a gender clinic for a year and not receive GAH. Whatever the reason was, it makes them non-representative of gender dysphoric teens at a gender clinic.\r  \n \r  \nThe short-term effect of GAH is no longer an unanswered question. Its theoretical basis was strong in the absence of data, but like many strong theories it has failed in the face of data. Now that two studies have failed to report meaningful benefit we can no longer say, as we could as recently as 2021, that the short-term benefits are so strong that they outweigh the potential long-term risks inherent in permanent body modification. Some non-trivial number of patients come to regret these body modifications, and we can no longer claim in good faith that there are enormous short term benefits that outweigh this risk. The gender affirming clinicians had two bites at the apple to find the benefit that they claimed would justify these dramatic interventions, and their failure to find it is much greater than I could have imagined two years ago.\r  \n \r  \nI am not unaware of how fraught and politicized this topic has become, but the time has come to admit that we, even the moderates like me, were wrong. When a teenager is distressed by their gender or gendered traits, altering their body with hormones does not help their distress. I suspect, but cannot yet prove, that the gender affirming model is actively harmful, and this is why these gender studies do not have the same methodological problem of large placebo effect size that plagues so much research in psychiatry. When I do in depth chart reviews of suicidal twenty-something trans adults on my inpatient unit, I often see a pattern of a teenager who was uncomfortable with their body, \"affirmed\" in the belief that they were born in the wrong body (which is an idea that, whether right or wrong, is much harder to cope with than merely accepting that you are a masculine woman, or that you must learn to cope with disliking a specific aspect of your body), and their mental health gets worse and worse the more gender affirming treatments they receive. First, they are uncomfortable being traditionally feminine, then they feel \"fake\" after a social transition and masculine haircut, then they take testosterone and feel extremely depressed about \"being a man with breasts,\" then they have their breasts removed and feel suicidal about not having a penis. The belief that \"there is something wrong with my body\" is a cognitive distortion that has been affirmed instead of Socratically questioned with CBT, and the iatrogenic harm can be extreme.\r  \n \r  \nIf we say we care about trans kids, that must mean caring about them enough to hold their treatments to the same standard of evidence we use for everything else. No one thinks that the way we \"care about Alzheimer's patients\" is allowing Biogen to have free rein marketing Aduhelm. The entire edifice of modern medical science is premised on the idea that we cannot assume we are helping people merely because we have good intentions and a good theory. If researchers from Harvard and UCSF could follow over 300 affirmed trans teens for 2 years, measure them with dozens of scales, and publish what they did, then the notion that GAH is helpful should be considered dubious until proven otherwise. Proving a negative is always tricky, but if half a dozen elite researchers scour my house looking for a cat and can't find one, then it is reasonable to conclude no cat exists. And it may no longer reasonable to consider the medicalization of vulnerable teenagers due to a theory that this cat might exist despite our best efforts to find it.\r  \n \r  \n\\-An ABPN Board Certified Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist\r  \n \r  \nPS - To be clear, I support the civil rights of the trans community, even as I criticize their ideas. I see no more contradiction here than, for example, an atheist supporting religious freedom and being opposed to antisemitism. If an atheist can critique both the teachings and practices of hyper-Orthodox Hasidic Judaism, while being opposed to antisemitism at the same time, I believe that I can criticize the ideas of the trans community (\"born in the wrong body\") while still supporting their civil rights and opposing transphobia in all forms.",

I'm not going to relate the whole case, suffice it to say the patient was awake, talking and neurologically intact on arrival, hemodynamically stable with no hard signs of vascular injury, and showed definitive signs of airway compromise ie diffuse surgical emphysema, air leak from the bullet tract, stridor, hypoxic distress (SaO2 84%) and a pool of blood in the pharynx. Initial blood gas was fairly decent with normal pCO2, mild metabolic acidosis and lactate of 4.0.\n\nFollowing a brief call to my attending, I moved quickly with rapid sequence intubation, but I was forced to bag after induction to prevent worsening hypoxia. There was blood everywhere and the anatomy was severely distorted, but I managed to get chest rise and breath sounds post intubation. Despite this SaO2 never recovered beyond 80% and then fell fast. Cardiac arrest followed; CPR was done but was ultimately futile.\n\nI've done some reading and discovered that conventional RSI can be disastrous with airway injuries. Seeing as there was a clear air leak close to the airway I should have kept the patient awake and inserted a tracheostomy tube directly into the tract and inflated the cuff distal to the injury. Suction would have taken care of any aspirated blood and I would have bought the patient enough time to get to theatre. I don't know why my attending did not tell me to secure the airway this way.\n\nThis happened months ago and I'm still haunted by the woman's face. I'm afraid to call the coroner to confirm the cause of death because that could eliminate any uncertainty about my being responsible.",

They frequently interrupt me or I just had a patient cut me off in the middle of my giving a plan. I keep talking now when they do that but I still wonder why they don't let me finish. I got yelled at by a patient's wife yesterday for asking questions about whether he was seeing his other oncologist by telemedicine and when she asked to see the \"doctor that knows my husband,\" I told her that this is part of my training and that I had to ask these questions for my attending. Her husband backed me up, which I appreciate.\n\nI know there's a stereotype of Manhattan patients being both educated and demanding. I also work with patients who frequently have terrible diagnoses and am learning to take their outbursts less to heart. However, I feel like I'm missing something in how to interact with these people effectively because I've had some deeply unpleasant interactions with patients. \n\nWhat are some strategies you all have successfully employed for talking to chronically ill patients or patients with pretty awful diagnoses where you maintained rapport but also controlled the dialogue? Is controlling the dialogue even what I should be seeking? Sorry if I sound too sensitive here as well.",

    "text": "Metronidazole and vaping. \nI’m a doctor practicing in Europe, and just wanted to put forward a couple of minor cases I had in the ER last night for, well, I guess “input”?\n\nFirst is a young woman, 20s, who presented with what she thought was a severe allergic reaction to metronidazole, which she had been prescribed a few days prior for a tooth infection. Complaints were sudden onset vomiting, sweating, tachycardia, “feeling of impending doom” as quoted by herself. Now, the reason I put forward this case is; she apologised after I entered the room, as the first time I tried to make contact she had popped outside for a quick vape. When taking history, I asked her if she had a bottle of vape liquid I could look at, and she in fact did. The first ingredient was propylene glycol at 60%. Bingo, I thought. Metronidazole is known to cause these symptoms when combined with alcohol/propylene glycol. But then I thought, is the route of administration really sufficient to cause this reaction? I nevertheless told her to refrain from vaping for 48 hours if she could, and prescribed a different antibiotics, and she was discharged. But this had me wonder, given how many people vape nowadays — is the correlation enough to ask patients “vape status” before prescribing metronidazole? Has anyone else had similar encounters?\n\nI know I mentioned two cases, but this read is perhaps enough to put forward without boring you all. I can post the second case in a separate thread, perhaps.\n\nThank you all for any input.",

    "text": "What the Hippocratic Oath really says I remember having to recite the Hippocratic Oath during medical school inauguration, and afterwards the phrase \"First Do No Harm\" was probably engrained in our minds as its key ingredient. I'm currently reading *The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian* (Robin Lane Fox), he mentions the Hippocratic Oath in the chapter *The Eastern Greeks* that made me look up its history (I guess I was never curious enough to even wiki it). Apparently the one we recite in modern times is a [revised edition](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/doctors/oath_modern.html) from 1964. \n\nThe original version runs as \n\n>I swear by Apollo Healer, by Asclepius, by Hygieia, by Panacea, and by all the gods and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will carry out, according to my ability and judgment, this oath and this indenture.  \n>  \n>To hold my teacher in this art equal to my own parents; to make him partner in my livelihood; when he is in need of money to share mine with him; to consider his family as my own brothers, and to teach them this art, if they want to learn it, without fee or indenture; to impart precept, oral instruction, and all other instruction to my own sons, the sons of my teacher, and to indentured pupils who have taken the Healer's oath, but to nobody else.  \n>  \n>I will use those dietary regimens which will benefit my patients according to my greatest ability and judgment, and I will do no harm or injustice to them. Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked to do so, nor will I suggest such a course. Similarly I will not give to a woman a pessary to cause abortion. But I will keep pure and holy both my life and my art. I will not use the knife, not even, verily, on sufferers from stone, but I will give place to such as are craftsmen therein.  \n>  \n>Into whatsoever houses I enter, I will enter to help the sick, and I will abstain from all intentional wrong-doing and harm, especially from abusing the bodies of man or woman, bond or free. And whatsoever I shall see or hear in the course of my profession, as well as outside my profession in my intercourse with men, if it be what should not be published abroad, I will never divulge, holding such things to be holy secrets.  \n>  \n>Now if I carry out this oath, and break it not, may I gain for ever reputation among all men for my life and for my art; but if I break it and forswear myself, may the opposite befall me. – Translation by W.H.S. Jones.\n\nHere's what Fox has to say:\n\n>It is probably in the eastern Greek world that we should locate the most widely cited and endorsed of all Greek prose texts: the so-called 'Hippocratic Oath'. Doctors still contest, or appeal to, its principles, but within Greek medicine it was only the 'oath' of a minority of practitioners. There is no reason to ascribe it to the great Hippocrates, the most famous early Greek teacher of medicine who is linked to the east Greek island of Cos. Like Hippocrates himself (probably an early to mid-fifth-century doctor), its date is unknown, but its morals and ideals have been upheld for centuries as a tribute to 'Greek science'. As a 'charter text', what it says is sometimes misrepresented by those who appeal to it. It is even cited in support by those who disapprove of euthanasia. What it actually requires is that doctors swear not to assist poisoners, rather than not to assist those who wish to be helped to die. Most modern doctors still admire the clause against the sexual harassment of patients, women as well as men, although the Greek oath also protected the persons of slaves; most doctors are less keen on the oath not to give a pessary to a woman 'to assist an abortion'. The clauses swearing to share one's livelihood with one's teacher in medicine and not to repeat gossip heard in the course of everyday life, outside professional hours, disqualify even the most admiring modern doctors from the halo of the Hippocratic Oath's observance.",

    "text": "Need advice for dealing with discrimination at hospital Edit: Thanks for the comments/advice. We'll look in to suggestions here and hopefully find some solution. \n\nTL;DR\n\nI believe there is some systemic discrimination against minorities and women in my hospital system. This has not only negatively affected me and other employees but has also had a negative effect on patient care. The hospital is not accredited by the joint commission. I have spoken to an attorney who says I have a case but I don’t think this will cause large scale change as this is a very wealthy organization. Any ideas of who I can report to or what I should do to actually improve the situation here?\n\nLong Bit\n\nI work in a small town hospital in a conservative state. I originally trained in a large city in this state and my first job was in a large, liberal city in another state. The town has \\~100k population the hospital serves the surrounding area. All the leadership positions are white men and one white woman. Several incidents have happened in my time here.\n\n1. Soon after I got here they tied compensation in form of bonus to patient satisfaction (not uncommon) I objected in writing because of the demographics of this town being predominantly white and I had already experienced some racist comments from patients. I thought this would influence my patient satisfaction scores. I was given a handout from leadership with lists of things to improve satisfaction. One was “know the background of you patient population and the culture.” The following one was “ hire employees with similar backgrounds”. I was told this how things were going to be done.\n2. About 2 years into my time here a young white male colleague left the hospital for a new job. Prior to starting he was told the system that hired him was going do pay cuts across the board. He asked to come back to our hospital - the leadership took him back and promoted him to the head of the group replacing the older white gentleman (who was the boss when I was hired) passing over a minority gentleman who was the assistant head to the former boss. Relative to myself and the assistant head, the younger colleague has much less experience.\n3. In the time that all this happened several instances of discriminatory practices against patients of color occurred and I reported to my direct bosses.\n4. 2 female colleagues of color faced discrimination from colleagues and ultimately resigned from practice. Meanwhile white male physicians received at the most slaps wrist for major issues.\n\n\\-One sent inappropriate pictures to a subordinate- she somehow left the practice but he remained head of a department. This same physician got into a verbal altercation where a subordinate felt physically threatened. She ultimately resigned her position. He not only kept his employment but also kept his position as head of a department. This same physician has verbally attacked female physicians (two of color) which has influenced pt care decisions which were not consistent with best practice.\n\n5) Just recently I was not given an opportunity to apply for a position I wanted. I expressed interest to my boss about applying for it and was told I would be good fit. However less than a week later I was told the position was already given to another white male who has much less experience than me and hasn’t been at the hospital as long as I have. Nor did he have any qualifications that superseded mine.\n\nThen a few weeks ago my direct boss was promoted to a senior level position. He has participated in discriminatory jokes (openly) and does not consult female physicians of color. Despite it being best practice, he openly admitted to me he does not consult these other female physicians because another white male physician had spoken poorly of them\n\nWith his promotion he also informed he that he had chosen another white male to be the head of department. This gentleman had been part of the organization less than a one year. When I asked what his qualifications were above anyone else in the group – he became flustered and couldn’t give an answer. The final reply by the now promoted boss was it was “his decision”.\n\n\\*I understand things don’t always go your way careerwise but I feel there is some kind of systemic discrimination going on here when there are so many instances of more qualified minorities being passed over for less qualified white males. I understand there may be some “X” factor when the hired person has 3 years’ experience vs 5 years of experience but when several candidates with 5-10 years experience are passed over for someone who has <1 year experience and who just happens to be a white male…something doesn’t seem right. Especially when similar things or other discriminatory things keep happening here.\n\n6) A non-white patient who was also an employee of the hospital was hospitalized with a major medical problem requiring months of hospitalization. I joined her care team and saw she was developing complications from being hospitalized too long. I inquired as to why she was still hospitalized because I was confused about why she had not been moved to rehab where she could be better served. I was told that higher ups had decided not to let her go on to rehab because she was under the hospital’s insurance (they are self-insured) and do not want to pay for rehab when she could stay in the hospital within their own system. I raised a stink saying it was unethical as she was developing complications from not having more intensive therapy at rehab.\n\n7)During COVID a white pt who did not require ICU care was moved to the ICU without doctor approval as his white family member who was employed by the system was belligerent with a house supervisor and demanded his family member be moved. During that time many patients (including one of my own) coded and died while waiting for an ICU bed. I raised this issue to quality and did not see any repercussions or changes to policies.\n\n8) Also, another thing that happened during COVID, 1000+ death certificates were assigned to me by a nurse and then when the mistake was found I asked that it be rectified because this is a legal document- leadership said “oh don’t worry about it”.\n\n9) While I was sitting in the office my boss (white male) made a joke about how the “AMA recommended no longer identifying race for example 43 y.o. black female”. A white female colleague in the office (openly not behind closed doors) said, “ What do they want us to say 43 yo lazy mother fucker” and both people laughed. I understand everyone has prejudices but I cannot comprehend how in 2023, a person educated and trained to the same degree as myself, would be comfortable speaking this way in a professional setting.\n\n\\-There have been other similar comments like this amongst the staff here this one was just the most recent.\n\nI have spoken to a lawyer who tells me I have a personal case under title 7 of the civil rights act with max of 1 million in damages. The thing is that would be *a drop in the bucket* for this organization. They have a very large endowment and I’m aware of several lawsuits that were simply settled because they can easily afford it. I also spoke to a few colleagues who ended up resigning due to what they felt was discrimination against them but they ultimately did not want to go through the trouble of pursuing some legal solution.\n\nI’m trying to make a change in this system for patients many of whom are non-white in this town who have no choice in healthcare as this is the only option as well as for the female and/or non-white employees.\n\nI do not know if I have broader legal grounds due to discrimination affecting patient care in this town. Something like a class action lawsuit with more financial impact on them so they are motivated to change, or finding legal counsel that would take this to trial so that more attention can come to what is happening in this town. Media in this town is limited and most people who control media have connections or ties with the healthcare system.\n\nIs there an agency to report these things to? The Joint Commission apparently does not come here. But someone who has actual teeth and can enforce change on this place. I feel like its crazy this kind of stuff is happening in 2023 in a professional, somewhat large institution.\n\nThanks for any comments or advice you can give.",

    "text": "Is there a doctor or a nurse on board?! \nUpdate: I received a text from the flight attendant on 19 April. The lady survived. \n\nTLDR: we saved woman’s life in the air. Airlines carry IVs and cardiac drugs. Teamwork is awesome. \n\nYesterday I heard those words in my dream and woke up. The flight attendant repeated the phrase.  I’m surprised to hear the sounds of fluid bubbling in the back of someone’s mouth, a familiar but alarming sound.  \n\nI look back and notice a flight attendant looking slightly distressed and I, being a fresh nurse and seasoned medic, decide to go and assist.  A woman, who had a seizure and vomited, was slouched unresponsive in her seat. Her young grandson next to her was terrified. \n\nI ask the flight attendant for any medical equipment and she brings me a blood pressure cuff and stethoscope. 72 systolic and I couldn’t hear where the diastolic ended with the noise from the aircraft and she didn’t have a radial pulse. Pulses were high 40s, weak, via the carotid. I do a sternum rub to get there to come to.  She wakes up for about 90 seconds before her head slumps down again. During that time I was able to get some info that she takes lisinopril for HPTN and do a rapid stroke scale. She had left arm drift however I’m not sure if it’s because she is so weak she can’t hold her arms up or if it’s because she had a stroke. I place an oxygen mask over her face. \n\nAt this point the FA is on the phone with the doctor on the ground. \n\nAs I’m fighting to keep her up right in the seat 2 more nurses come up and ask if they can be of assistance. I tell them what I had found and said I think she may be having a stroke.  We come up with the idea to use my apple watch to get a single lead ecg (sinus Bradycardia on Lead II) and an SpO2 (undetectable on my watch assuming because it was so low).  A passenger offered her glucometer with a reading of 150.   \n\nAs I’m collaborating with these 2 the FA says the doc on the ground wants an IV and fluids run bolus. The FA gets the aid bags (they have 2 of them BTW) we start spiking the NS and getting equipment in place for an IV. We get 2 lines in her and start dropping fluids. \n\nWe give the FA report that her pressures (60/palp) and pulse (low 30s) are trending down. I grab the AED and put the pads on her. She’s cold, clammy and pale now. Still unresponsive but breathing on her own. The FA advises us the doctors want us to administer 0.5 mg of atropine. \n\nOne of the nurses is standing behind the woman in the isle behind her holding her body up while the other nurse is getting the atropine out. I admin the atropine after verifying with both nurses this is the order received. \n\nFive min or so pass and her pressure and pulse are still shit. No radial pulse. Shit…. We barely felt a carotid. The doc orders 0.5mg 1:10000 epi via IV and to repeat after 5 min if not helping. She got the full 1mg because the initial dose didn’t help. \n\nAt this point the plane is about to land and we have strong radial pulses in the 80s.  We brace to land and keep the PT staying in the chair. This whole situation took place over about 75 min. We were going to do an emergency landing but we were essentially not near another airport. The closest one being the direction we were heading. \n\nThe entire team I worked with no doubt saved this woman’s life. The 2 nurses that helped me were amazing. The FA assisted in changing the bottles of oxygen over, recorded the code, maintained a calm cabin environment and communicated with the pilots and doctors. People whom have never  met before with one common goal. Made me feel proud of this profession and others alike. \n\nThis all happened front of a packed cross country flight. We were in the very front so everyone in the back was watching us do this. You could feel the cameras peering though your nursing license. We had 3 clapping ovations from the aircraft… one of the cooler experiences I have ever had.\n\nEdit: this app was recommend for in air emergencies. \n[AirlineRx App](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1031955544)\n\n\nUpdate: Airline has given me a 50$ voucher for assisting\n\nEdit:  I forgot to mention one of the other nurses had the smart idea to take her shoelace off to hang the NS bags on the overhead bin. Lots of ingenuity going on.",

    "text": "Nurses - what is something that happened to a patient that will haunt you for life? Here is mine: I was a new grad nurse, just two months off of orientation. We had a woman that was admitted on a Friday for a stroke. Over the weekend, she had another stroke while on our unit. They had called a “stroke alert” on her and she was found to have had a stroke in another part of her brain. \n\nMonday comes around and I am her nurse. I took care of her all day, nothing seemed out of the ordinary to me.\n\nPatient did have a high SBP (190s) in the morning prior to receiving her scheduled medications and also vague complaints, like headache and nausea. I treated these things with PRN medications from her MAR with her morning med pass. She felt relieved with these treatments and there were no other complaints from her for the rest of the shift. \n\nAround 3pm, the doctors put in a discharge order for her. I didn’t discharge her until about 6:30 - per her request. She told me that her son would be off work at 6pm and she would need him to pick her up and also need help getting into her house. So I waited and discharged her hours after the order was put in. \n\nBlood pressure at the time of discharge was 130s and I even asked her if any headaches or nausea were present. She denied both. \n\nAbout an hour after I discharged her , we received a call on the unit from her family saying she was unresponsive at home. I lost sleep over that, thinking maybe I missed something or that I could’ve done something better to prevent that from happening. It’s been a long time since that happened but I still think about it from time to time.",

    "text": "I’m a nurse manager. And I’m fed up. I’m a nurse manager for a large department in an even larger hospital organization. I started here as a young nurse and I used to love my job, looked forward to coming to work. The patient population is exactly what I wanted and my coworkers were incredible. I quickly rose through the ranks and when a manager spot opened up, my coworkers and leaders alike encouraged me to apply.\n\nI have always been very upfront about my intentions as a manager. I didn’t take an office job to get off the floor or have an easier gig or make more money. (In fact, if you factor in shift differential, overtime, and COVID incentives from that time, I ended up taking a pay cut by promoting, as confirmed by my tax returns.) I took a leadership role because I wanted to improve working conditions for the staff on the floor. I believe that if management takes care of nursing, nursing will in turn take care of the patients effectively (excluding the bad apples that you have to weed out occasionally). I was excited to update policies to reflect actual practices. I was eager to implement ideas I had been polishing in my head for the last few years. I was hungry to invoke a change in the mindset of leadership and address the dwindling morale of the nursing profession.\n\nBut after years of trying, I give up. “Management/admin doesn’t care about floor staff” isn’t just something nurses say when they’re burnt out; I can confirm with first-hand experience that it’s true. And I’m heartbroken.\n\nI believe most of the members of my mid-tier management team care about staff, or at least try to, but the senior leaders make it difficult. At any given moment, I have between 110-130 employees who report to me. That’s 130 timecards to correct every other Monday. 130 employees to follow up with when they lapse on certifications or employment requirements. 130 employees who come to my office with concerns. 130 employees who call and text me outside of business hours. 130 evaluations to sign annually. How are you supposed to make a meaningful connection with 130 employees? You don’t. But try telling that to a high-up who has maybe 5-10 direct reports at the most. 130 employees alone is enough to burn out even the most empathetic manager.\n\nThen there are the meetings. Some days I am double or triple booked with meetings, and most of them are just opportunities for people above me to pat themselves on the back. Or for them to tell managers that employees aren’t happy and we aren’t visiting them on the units often enough. Or there’s the HR-led meeting about how to be an effective leader, run by a woman who has never led people a day in her life. She tells us to make face-to-face connections with every single one of our employees. This is said during a virtual meeting because she cannot be bothered to drive to our departmental campus.\n\nAnd here is where my morale tanks: Human Resources. The backbone of a company, meant to be impartial and policy-focused, right? Not here. Ours is run by a woman who doesn’t even have a degree in HR. She’s been a VP with us less than a year and already ruined this organization. First and foremost, if you have a serious employee issue, good luck getting HR to help. I once had an employee situation that involved a very serious racism allegation. I sent multiple emails and texts to my HR rep asking for assistance and outlining the problem. No response. I finally had to involve the CNO TWICE before a meeting was arranged. What’s the first thing the HR VP said to me in this meeting? “You should have involved us sooner.”\n\nAnd before someone says I need to speak up, I have. Last year HR hosted a meeting where management teams from all departments were expected to attend and suggest quality improvements. I talked about having too many direct reports, too much meaningless busy work, too many meetings. I told them I hated that I was forced to attend meetings that did not impact me in any way when I could be on the units helping my nurses who are working short staffed. Many others agreed. Nothing changed. In fact, lately I have been forced to attend a subcommittee where we are forced to redefine leadership terms to fit the organization. No joke, we sit there for hours while others pedantically argue over the verbiage of something I can just google. I spoke up about that too. Why am I wasting my time when there are already evidence-based definitions and leadership courses that address this? This does not help floor staff in any way. I was told those EBP courses focus too much on EMPATHY.\n\nWanna know the cherry on top? My department works with incredibly dangerous patients and the risk for injury is higher than most. If an employee is injured and goes to get checked out or is told by a doctor to be off of work, they are forced to use their own PTO. The organization used to use admin pay, but stopped years ago. My direct leader told us to use the employee’s extended illness leave instead because that’s rarely tapped into. HR caught wind of that and told us to cease and desist. So my employee who was punched in the face just for doing his job is now out 24 hours of PTO because a patient decided to hit him. This happens multiple times a week. (Also, many of our employees are from other countries and save their PTO to use on trips to visit home.) This has led to nurses not wanting to report injuries and assaults to avoid being off the schedule. But sure, company, tell the public all about how you value your nurses and we’re healthcare warriors.\n\nI’m so lost. I don’t know if I should keep fighting in the hope that something will change, at the risk of ruining my mental health. Or do I go back to the floor that I enjoyed so much? Or do I completely jump ship because I know the truth about how corrupt the core of this company is? Even thinking about stepping down makes me feel like I failed my employees. But I feel like I would be more help to them while working alongside them rather than sitting in my office listening to a bunch of big wigs wonder why nurses don’t want to work here. (Even though I am vocal about better pay/benefits/working conditions. I even told them how offensive pizza parties are when that idea was brought up.)",

Which really didn’t make sense to me considering you don’t touch someone during a CT, but I would rather not revisit the subject to clarify. \n\nNot only as a woman with a larger chest, but this supposed-to-be professional healthcare worker, sexualizing a patient, did not sit well with me. \nI spoke with a few of my co-workers to see if I was overreacting and they all said I should file a complaint, because my thought process is, if I was that patient and being sexualized by a provider, I would want someone to advocate for me too. \n\nMight I add, I have NEVER gotten an unprofessional or creepy vibe from any one of the physicians I have worked with, but when I worked with this man, It felt like I had a wrench in my stomach, to the point of  not feeling safe going anywhere alone with him. \nJust seeking other medical professionals advice, experience and wit.

    "text": "I had the chance to save someone, and I failed. And now she's gone forever. Working in OB is a  trip. It's a great cross-section of humanity, and it brings you face to face with things you only hear about in documentaries. Domestic violence, SA, drugged up moms, some of the strangest and most awful family dynamics you've ever imagined. These are all things I see on a semi-regular basis.\n\nThere are patients that touch your heart in a good way. First time parents in their late 30s who finally got pregnant with the help of IVF, both crying over their newborn. 3-day inductions who work so hard and so long to get their baby out safely, who turn inward on their pain and go through it because they know it's the best thing they can do. Dad's who jump up when babies are brought in to breastfeed so they can be present and helpful when their partners are struggling to keep their eyes open.\n\nThen there are patients that touch your heart in the worst ways. The ways that stay with you for always. The awful sounds a mom makes when they realize their baby is gone from this world. The women whose eyes go horribly blank and dead whenever they're touched to protect the hurt and trauma they've buried inside of them. The rainbow of bruises across the abdomen of a battered woman.\n\nDid you know that the #1 cause of death in pregnant women is domestic violence?\n\nThere was a woman. A girl, really. Someone who will stay with me always. Someone who I'll never forget, and who my soul will never forgive me for not saving. Not only was she disabled, severely, both mentally and physically, but she was a victim of human trafficking. She'd been sold, by her husband, to a man listed on the sex offender list, a man who had been convicted of \"violent rape of a person 0-14 years of age\". According to the website. According to his file. She'd been bought and paid for, as was the child in her womb. She stayed with us for 3 nights. For 3 nights, I tried to save her. I called every hotline, put in every consult, informed every authority that I could that she was here with us, without him, and it was imperative that we get her out of this terrible situation.\n\nShe had 3 nights in the hospital with us. But she'd had 9 months in the office with our doctors. Our doctors, who made an appointment for her to be seen at a higher acuity hospital, in order for her to be declared a dependent adult. It would have given her an advocate of the state, who could have given her resources, a place to live, a way out. Obviously, her traffickers did not take the opportunity to drive her to this appointment. Instead of following up, instead of making sure she had a way to go to that appointment, our doctors shrugged it off and moved on to their next patient.\n\nI love my doctors. I have a very good relationship with all but one of them. We work closely together toward the same goal: Happy, healthy moms and babies. But on night 3, after hanging up with the last hotline on my list, after being told \"I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do\" one final time, I sat down with one of my doctors, and I unloaded. I cried at work. I never cry at work. I cried, and I raged, and I seethed, and I bitched. I told her that this was HER fault. It was THEIR fault that this woman, this woman we could have saved, now had a tubal ligation and would be discharged in the morning, back to her traffickers, when we could have stopped it. She sat silently with me, only offering murmurs of affirmation and comfort when I took a break to breathe. She accepted responsibility and apologized. To the patient, and to me. No matter the guilt and resentment I have for our doctors and for myself, I'll always give her credit for being patient and accepting responsibility.\n\nThe girl is gone. I'll never see her again. Her baby is safe, our one saving grace. We fought hard for them both, but in the end, the baby was the only one we could save. She was adopted by a loving family in a different state. But the girl is gone.\n\nI don't know how to get over this. I don't think I ever will. There's no moral here, no succinct or happy ending. She's gone, and we're to blame.",

    "text": "Have you ever encountered nurses who are great at skills but terrible critical thinkers or the other way around? I work with a girl who has been an LPN for like 11 years and recently finished her RN program. She’s not an RN yet because she actually failed the NCLEX 2 or 3 times. Which, sure, some people are bad test takers. But then upon working with this girl I noticed a few things. She’s really good at skills. Wound care, tube feeds, IV stuff, foleys, whatever. Probably 1 of the best hands on nurses. But she lacks so much critical thinking or sometimes just plain logic.\n\nFor example, she told me to use the purple wipes for sanitizing equipment from a CDIFF room because I couldn’t find any orange wipes nearby. Haaaard no. She pulls pts medications from their drawer and gives it to them just if it has todays date and time labeled on the package. Why I never do this is because the drawers get really unorganized and other nurses sometimes use pills that are dated for tomorrow night instead of searching for tonight’s. We also use epic so we have the MAR and the brain and she never verifies medications on the MAR, she just gives whatever is labeled for right now and then documents everything as given (we don’t scan).\n\nAnd 1 time at shift change when I was giving report, she was just walking around and casually said to me, “hey your patient just fell” and walked away. Didn’t check on her, didn’t press the call belll, nothing lol. This pt was an elderly woman admitted to rehab for aspiration pneumonia. She weighed about 80 pounds and was on 3 liters NC (which the nurse I’m referring to knew). When she fell, her oxygen came off and by the time me and the nurse I was giving report to were able to run over there, the pts oxygen saturation was 72% and her pulse was 42. The oncoming nurse and I were pretty concerned but the other nurse acted like it was nothing?? I contacted the doctor anyway. Pt was fine, she’s comfort cares now and her family doesn’t want any interventions done. But still.\n\nHave you experienced nurses that seem to only be good at half of the job? Are they hard to work with?",

    "text": "Being rude to female residents but nice to male residents is pathetic misogynistic behaviour. I’m a nurse myself and wanted to share this. Of course not every nurse is like this but I’ve been noticing it a bit more and more. I remember when it was brought up on some of the residency forums and I initially didn’t think much of it but then I realized that wait… I have actually seen it in person a good number of times now. I’ve noticed it’s both the old and young nurses engaging in this behaviour. There is even a nurse in particular who is not even discreet about this. She’s always so standoffish when talking with female residents, even when they just have a simple question. But is always all smiles and giggles with the male ones. There was even this one female resident who was literally going out of her way to be nice to us and was asking where we kept our N95s. Two of the nurses couldn’t even look her in the eye and were treating her like she was bothering us (nobody was busy btw). \n\n\nIdk it’s just so lame to me. If anything sometimes I have a soft spot for the female residents because I know it can be challenging being a woman in spaces that are still mostly male dominated. And just because some nurses want to snag a doctor or find them attractive does NOT give you the right to disrespect female residents. Also that female resident you’re being nasty to has a higher chance of dating that male resident that you find hot so idk why any nurse would think being rude would help their case.  \n\nI’m also noticing that this profession also seems to attract a lot to pick me women with internalized misogyny. I’ve lost count of the amount of nurses who  to complain about how women are just too much drama or even worse how they only want male children because girls are sooo hard to raise. They only wanna be boy moms. It’s funny because all this complaining about other women and little girls yet so many nurses are dating or married to bums that contribute nothing to the household but that’s a story for another day.

    "text": "I’m tired of being talked down to by a certain surgeon. There is a cardiovascular surgeon that pretty much owns the small Texas hospital I work at. Well, today I got chewed out. I was in PCU with a 4:1 ratio, with one of my POD 5 CABG patients being very morbidly obese (5 feet, 350 lbs). During report we did not have time to sit our patient in the chair, since she was a Hoyer lift patient. I decided to complete my morning care and return to sit her when I had ample staff to assist her to chair. Of course day shift got busy. Rounds with case management commenced and in walks the surgeon, he proceeds to loudly come to the desk as he waltzes in with his NP. He barks out “Do we have any intelligent nurses in here today?” in his most condescending tone. He then sees the new nurse manager and talks about how we could hire 17 nurse managers and they would all just be sitting at the nurse’s station doing nothing. Mind you this is all unprovoked. He then starts barking for the nurse to come and see him for his patients. I get out of my chair and he rolls his eyes and proceeds to complain that I should have ran up to him to round as soon as I saw him (I CANNOT with this fking guy). \n\nHe then goes to my patient’s bedside and sees her eating in bed. I already felt like I was gonna pee my pants out of nerves. He proceeded to bark at me about how lazy I was, how we need nurses like they used to have them 40 years ago, how he shouldn’t have to beckon me to round with him, and how dare I not have his patient up to chair for her first meal. \n\nI tried to explain that we need ample staff to assist her to chair, and that I was in rounds when he walked in. He states he doesn’t care what I was doing, there are plenty of people at the desk “sitting around”. I told him, fine, we would sit her up right now. I grab a male nurse, while he watches us struggle to stand pivot this 350 woman to the chair, almost breaking our backs. We miraculously get her to chair. My director walks and in and cue more angry bitching about how he can’t wait to retire to Italy so he doesn’t have to “put up with this crap”. Director and nurse manager also got talked down to.\n\nThe entire time he bitched, all I could do was silently go “mhm” while he ranted and raved. I don’t know how to stand up for myself. I’m tired of being talked down to. Obviously, this surgeon is a real piece of work. He has a reputation for being hostile, and I won’t be the first or the last nurse he does this to. \n\nHow can I set boundaries or stand up for myself with doctors like this?",

    "text": "Will it ever, ever get better? (New grad, horrible shift) I’m a new grad who has been on my own for 4 months on a stroke/med-surg/tele floor — yesterday I had one of ‘those’ shifts, the ones I get at least once, maybe 2-3 times a month that truly makes me question my will to continue existing. Why didn’t I become an accountant, a barista, or anything else? Why am I here in this hospital?\n\nI had 5 patients: a total-care stroke patient, a newly-withdrawing CIWA who wanted his valium Q1h and dilaudid Q2h on the DOT, a COPD exacerbation patient who was on the light frequently, and thankfully a mostly-independent woman being worked up for falls. Halfway through my insanely busy shift I was given a pleasant patient with a newly-clamped CBI. My stroke patient took my entire day: stroke assessments, neurochecks, 7 IV fluids (abx, K riders, more electrolyte replacements, initiating tube feeds, fighting a dobhoff tube that would easily clog) back-to-back-to-back, turns/daily care because our CNAs are thinly-spread or on their lunch. Between rounds, meds, helping my patients with random things they needed (which I am happy to do) as I said our CNAs are always busy/hard to get a hold of, there was hardly time to chart between tasks or make sure I completed all of my assessments in a timely manner between meds. I was so overwhelmed, when I sat down 1.5 hours after the end of my shift to finally chart, I mentally reviewed my day and realized/processed that a handful of things happened that I should have reported to the physician, but now hours had passed before it would do any good for my patients. I just realized I was so stressed during the last 14 hours, I had no presence of mind to focus on what actually mattered - thinking critically and being able to act on important changes in my patients. I was so focused on not getting behind, getting everyone their meds, and trying to not stay at the hospital 2 hours late as has been my challenge since orientation ended.\n\nWhen I got my stroke patient at 7am, the off-going RN said he knew she wiggled her toes, but didn’t note more movement in her lower extremities. For my assessments, she wouldn’t wiggle her toes, move away if I tickled her feet, or withdraw to pain/a pinch. I was so overwhelmed in her room (there were 5+ very involved family members there at all times) I just charted my assessment as I tried to move on and tackle the next task. I sat at the end of the day and realized I completely dropped the ball, paged the doctor, and spoke with him in utter shame that I hadn’t reported it earlier when I noticed it. “She’s been like that all day?” I literally wanted to disappear, there was no excuse.\n\nI noticed during shift-change when I went to visit my CBI patient that his urine was clear, dark red. When I got him at 3pm it was light pink. I think I noticed it earlier during his med-pass, it literally never occurred to me to update his hospitalist about the change in color. Me and the on-coming nurse paged the doctor, again I wanted to throw up and disappear.\n\nI missed so many things during my shift that I know I might have not if I wasn’t so busy. There are so many things that disrupt the work-flow, calls from family members during med-passes (when the UC said to please call back, the nurse is busy, the family member proceeded to call 2 more times. I finally sat to speak with her, I understand family members are worried, but I was literally drowning in my work. I didn’t eat, I peed once - thank God - I hadn’t had any water and even then was barely staying afloat). I wept in the med room and was holding back tears while passing someone’s meds because I couldn’t hold in my misery anymore. I was short in tone with a lot of people from the stress (I have great shame from this too, I know there's no excuse and I'm trying to be more cognizant of myself and respond better when I'm stressed). I cried at home to my spouse. Some days are fine, some are better and I feel like I’m getting the hang of it, others I just wish I chose to do something different. I love patients, I love their families, I love making people feel better. I just hate working under conditions where I feel I’m set up to fail. I don’t know if my mind/brain/personality is built to handle the craziness of working on the floor, on nights like this I feel I’m just not smart enough or cut out for it, especially after dropping the ball on such important developments in my patients.\n\nJust wanted a place to vent where someone understands. Can anyone speak to this feeling or experience? If anything, I pray you had/are having a better shift, or are resting if you had a bad one recently too.

    "text": "Need advice about sketchy practices of a rural hospital So I just recently started working in the outpatient surgery center of a small rural hospital that is supposedly up and coming. Everything has been okay so far- I am enjoying the smaller patient case load and more relaxed atmosphere. However today a situation came up that rubbed me the wrong way and made me question how long I would stay at this hospital. \n\nAn elderly woman came in for a total shoulder procedure that usually for her age and risk factors she would be expected to stay overnight for observation. However, the surgeon said no she can go home today. This surgeon has been known to send people home that should stay at the hospital for observation and WILL NOT change his mind. \n\nSo after the procedure she is in PACU and not recovering well. Her vitals are fine but after 2 hours she still cannot wake up and is delirious. She also cannot void in the bedside commode (which was an ordeal to get her on), and it was discovered that she did not have a good support system at home to care for her. Despite all of this, the surgeon still said no to her staying. We escalated the situation to the DON and she sided with the doctor without even seeing the patient. Even the surgeons NP seemed uncomfortable with her going home. \n\nSo the patient is not able to safely discharge home but we don’t have a choice but to discharge her because no one will admit her to the hospital. \n\nMy concern is if she has a bad outcome at home, who does this fall on? The nurses discharged her but it’s not like they had another choice.  \n\nI felt wrong and sketchy throughout the entire situation.",

    "text": "I am anonymously planning on reporting my former employer to the Dept of Labor. She's rich & powerful, & I'm a nobody in comparison. Has anyone else done this? Advice on covering my ass? I moved to NYC completely naive & unprepared. I moved from the deep south where I was used to hospitality & never had to worry about never getting a fair wage at the hospital I worked for. I was stupidly honest to the surgeon who hired me that I wasn't familiar with the salary expectations in NYC. She offered me $80k which I know now isn't enough to live off of & is new grad salary (&I've been a nurse for 5 yrs). It was a private practice & I had nobody to turn to. This is what I've experienced. I'll call her Dr. X. Her office was small, with only 5 staff: herself, her nepo child who would one day take over the business, the manager, & the marketer. I was at the bottom of the totem pole (she literally told me that).\n\nUnsanitary practices: she forced me to reuse \"one-time use\" items, such as tubing, drains, even had me re-sterilize syringes! She cut corners whenever possible. It felt wrong to me, & she justified it saying that in the hospital they replace these things for infection prevention but since they had a small office they could keep track of these things. I had to do as I was told or risk being screamed/yelled at & belittled. She also reused post-surgical garments. She forced me to take it from the patient once I remove the garment without saying anything & not mention I was keeping it to reuse it. I felt like I had to hide things from patients which just didn't feel right to me.\n\nNot replacing broken/outdated equipment: This doctor was so cheap that she willingly kept broken equipment that needed to be replaced. The sterilizer door had a problem, but she'd always blame the nurse for not knowing how to use it. The gauges for the gas pressure no longer worked-- oh well, we had to just keep an eye on it without knowing how much was actually in the tanks. The guy from the gas company tried convincing her to replace the system for years. The lipo machine was also broken-- the technician told me he's tried to convince Dr X for like a decade to replace the machine but she wouldn't do it (until right when I quit, of course). There was an instance where a patient was cut open having lipo & the suction wasn't working properly-- we had to troubleshoot for like half an hr & still couldn't get it to work properly. The computer I had to use was also over 12 yrs old & was incredibly slow & the memory was used up. Yet it was my fault when the computer wasn't working right, always. Of course she finally replaced it when I left.\n\nForcing reviews while patients were under the influence: She would force me to stay in the room and make the patient write a 5 star review & make sure the review was detailed enough. She got angry when the review was too short & ordered me to go back in the room & make the patient write more. I once observed her making a patient write a review after having nitrous gas & oxycodone. The patient wasn't able to form comprehensive sentences, so the doctor took the phone from her hand & wrote the review for her. She made her write \"Dr X is the best!\" & stuff. So she has almost all 5 star reviews online & I've had to oversee some of them be written so I know they're fake/pressured.\n\nOvertime work, all the time, with no proper lunch break: When I took this salary job, my foolish self thought, \"maybe that means if I finish my work early I can go home!\" My hours signing up were 8 am to 5 pm M-F. After working there, she said that actually technically my hours were 8 am to 6 pm, making my work week technically 50 hrs/wk. & she never mentioned this prior to me being hired. Plus the former nurses who worked with her made excuses for Dr X's terrible behavior making me feel further invalidated. Dr X also booked patients constantly back to back throughout the day with no break. Whenever I tried to eat, she scoffed & would still talk to & bother me. I never ate more than 10 minutes. I was under constant surveillance in her small office (cameras everywhere) & was nitpicked constantly. I worked harder than I ever did in my entire life & got treated like garbage.\n\nUnderstaffing: Everything was on me & I got blamed for everything. I had to take out all of the trash in the office every single day. She was too cheap to hire extra staff to assist with the cleaning or laundry everyday. She had custodial help come in 2 days a week to help clean floors & take out trash & that's it. I'd never done SO much laundry in my life (esp w/ surgery, & esp since everything was reused) & also had to wash/sterilize all the instruments. Oh, & she wanted me to iron the scrubs for everyone in the office! I often found myself leaving an hour to 1.5 hrs late because of being overwhelmed by the amount of cleaning. I usually worked about 50 hrs/week, never got compensated or appreciated, & every moment of it was hard work & stressful.\n\nShe was incredibly entitled & had no respect for anyone. I remember she tapped my butt with her foot when I bent over on the ground to pick things up; she did this multiple times. I was treated like a servant by her & her daughter. I had to clean up after their messes & they had no regard for me except what they could get out of me. \n\nI lost everything while working for that awful woman. I lost my mental & physical health. I didn't have enough time to eat properly so I lost weight without trying. I also didn't have time for the gym anymore. Honestly, all my life I've been a pushover people pleaser who didn't know how to stand up for herself. My family urged me to stay at this job, thinking it was a good career move because of Dr X's name. I felt so much pressure & like such a failure.  When I quit, it felt like 1 of the best decisions in my whole life. \n\nTLDR; I know this was long, but Idk if it even truly covers all I've had to go through. Working for this doctor was absolute hell. I was underpaid, overworked (overtime all the time w/o compensation), no lunch break, forced to work with faulty/broken equipment, unsanitary practices reusing one-time use items, forced to oversee & influence patient reviews. etc. \n\nShe's rich & well renowned. None of her former nurses have spoken up about this, probably also partly out of fear of being negatively affected. It's such a small office & she can keep track of who said what much more easily since she only has one nurse at a time. I want to stay completely anonymous, but I also believe something needs to be said about her unethical practices. It's not right for her nurses, but also not right for the patients. & her terrible daughter is following in her footsteps.",

    "text": "Are there any teachers here with Autism? What kinds of accommodations have you asked for? Saw a similar post from a year ago but it wasn’t super helpful.\n\nTo provide some background, I’m a choir teacher in a public school and this is my fourth year teaching (second year at this school). I was diagnosed with ASD Level 1 this summer, I sought diagnosis because of struggles with differences in communication and sensory needs. I am most sensitive to noise.\n\nI plan to inform my admin of my diagnosis as soon as I have it in writing from my doctor. They have already observed me teaching, so I am not worried about whether or not they think I am a capable teacher. What types of accommodations do you think are reasonable to ask for from my admin?  \n\nIn addition, I would love the opportunity to educate the other adults (and even my students!) about what being an adult woman with autism is like, as a lot of them hear “autism” and expect to see someone with pretty high support needs like a lot of diagnosed students. I am thinking about offering to lead a PD day on this topic. Does that seem strange to offer?\n\nMany thanks for the insight!\n\nEdit: To clarify, I was mostly looking for examples of accommodations that you have asked for yourself. \n\nIt also seems like most people responding are autistic, so let me clarify this too: not EVERY noise triggers me. As someone who has been in music ensembles for my whole life, I’m very used to noise in ensemble settings, or else I wouldn’t be doing this job. It’s the sudden, unexpected loud noises that are triggering to me. Think of kids in the hallway randomly screaming between classes, or random screams of excitement during assemblies in the auditorium.",

    "text": "I got a $2 \"raise\" and lost all of my government benefits because I \"make too much\" now to qualify. It's not enough to live off of. This really sucks. I know I'm going to get raked over the coals for this and I'm really ashamed and honestly embarrassed as hell about this. I went from making $18 an hour and received a \"raise\" of $2.25 and now make $20.25 an hour. Under any other circumstance, I think most people would celebrate because yay, a raise. But because I received SNAP, Medicaid and WIC for myself and my daughter, I had to notify my case worker (and got scolded by her for not informing her \"immediately\" when I received my raise. Now I'm worried I'm going to get in trouble with social services) and received a letter in the mail earlier this week that my SNAP benefits went from $208 a month...to $28 a month. I lost Medicaid because I am above the limit. The only thing I didn't fully lose was my WIC benefits.\n\nIt's still not enough to live off of. My rent is going up $200 in April from $900 to $1100. I have a one bedroom apartment and still co-sleep with my toddler because I can't afford a toddler bed for her. That $208 a month I would receive in SNAP benefits is what really fed us throughout the month - shopping at Aldi and WalMart, mostly. I buy the cheapest diapers and wipes, eat a lot of peanut butter and potatoes and sometimes skip meals so my daughter has enough to eat, only shower every other day to keep the water bill low, keep our apartment at 66 to keep our power bill low. According to my case worker, I should \"make enough\" to cover rent, electric, water, gas, trash, the list goes on and on. But I don't. I regularly have to juggle which utility can be paid, which can be put off, I have to calculate groceries down to the penny.\n\nMy child's biological father doesn't pay child support and hasn't in months. He's currently in jail for sexually assaulting a minor. He was abusive to me so it doesn't surprise me that he went after someone younger. Of course his parents and siblings and friends are saying he's innocent because the child he assaulted \"looked older and he had no idea\" 🙄\n\nHe is required to pay $80 a week in child support but I might have seen that every other month, if I'm lucky. My case worker knows he's supposed to pay but he can't pay anything if he's in jail so it's just sitting in arrears. He doesn't care about her and never did in the first place. I've done everything I can to keep her happy and healthy but here I am, looking at lower paying jobs again just to get my assistance back.\n\nYesterday I sent my kid to daycare like normal. Got a call on my lunch break that she was coughing and I needed to come pick her up because the woman running the daycare said it sounded like a wet cough. I had to leave work early and get a passive aggressive \"Wow, your kid gets sick a lot huh?\" from my manager - which I don't blame her for. She doesn't have kids but damn, it sucks. Whenever my kid is sick and has to have a doctor's note to go back to daycare, I get one for myself too so I'm covered.\n\nPick my kid up and yeah,she's sick. She has a fever and a cough. Her pediatrician couldn't see her because they had no sick appointments available and the on call nurse said to take her to urgent care. Spent almost two hours waiting to be seen at urgent care and failing to keep a mask on my toddler. When the doctor saw her, he said it was a chest cold and there was nothing to really be done besides giving her fluids, meds for her fever and recommended over the counter cough medicines for her. Said to take her back to her pediatrician if it got worse or if her fever spiked to 104. We ended up being at the urgent care until after 7 pm and I went to WalMart to get her medicine.\n\nAt this point, my daughter was tired, cranky, coughing hard enough to constantly drink out of her water bottle. She looked and felt miserable. I had less than thirty dollars in my bank account until I get paid again, and that's when all of the bills are due. The zarbee's cough and mucus was nearly $20 for the night and day two pack, or almost $13 for just the daytime pack. My daughter was going in between coughing and crying, ripping her mask off, practically going feral to get out of the cart and I was getting nasty looks from others (because I know how awful it is to take a sick kid out but I didn't have much choice, couldn't leave her in the car for fucks sake) I just got so overwhelmed, put the zarbee's in the cart and grabbed other few groceries we needed, Just a few things to get us through until my WIC reloads. When I went through self check out, I just didn't ring up the zarbee's because I couldn;t afford it. I just sat my other bags on top of the box and walked out feeling like I was sweating bullets the whole time.\n\nI still feel so guilty and gross and felt even worse when we got back home and I had to practically force my daughter to take it. She ended up spiting over half of the medicine back out, all down her shirt and tried to wipe her face, which got the medicine in her hair, so she had to get a bath. Ended up giving her another half dose in the bathtub while she cried and had a fit to get out because all she wanted was \"uppy uppy\". I just cried along with her because I felt so bad. For her being sick and miserable and mad at myself that I had to stoop so low. I know WalMart isn't going to hurt that much over some zarbee's, but I've never stolen anything in my life before. I shouldn't have to do this. I am straight up terrified of going back to that WalMart and my stomach turns into knots when I think about it.\n\nThe welfare cliff really fucking sucks and I wish I could be happy about getting a \"raise\" and making slighty more money but now I'm just feeling down and low and shitty. It shouldn't be this hard to provide for my child, it shouldn't be this hard to live period. Her cough is getting better so I'm hoping I can take her back to daycare on Monday with the note from the urgent care doc but I am just so tired of struggling and having anxiety nightmares about which bill's gonna get paid this time or not. I just want a little breathing room and to wake up one morning feeling okay and not a pit of despair in my stomach. I know I'm not alone in feeling this way but damn it would be nice not to worry or stress for just a few goddamn days.",

    "text": "How do i deal with coworkers being neglectful of our client? im not one hundred percent sure that this is where i should post this but here i go.\n\n  ive been working with a local company as a support person (DSP) for a year now. basically my job is to help disabled adults with their day to day life. my regular client is an adult and has 24/7 support and quite a few staff that work regularly with her. ill call her sammy\n\n  \n  Sammy is wonderful. shes funny, sweet, and creative, and VERY easy to work with as she lives her day to day almost completely independently and is partially non-verbal (so usually she doesnt even want to shoot the shit). she and i have a good relationship, and im her preferred staff. she feels quite comfortable with me and trusts me. because of this im usually the person she comes to when shes having a problem or feels unable to advocate for herself. \n\n  \n  now, when i started with sammy i was told by other staff that shes horrible. that she lies about staff, she doesnt clean, shes manipulative, shes lazy. i was nervous at first but i wanted to go into this with an open mind, so i made up my mind to always take her at face value. i know from experience that some neurotypicals just will never get it and will always treat disabled people like theyre annoying for simply being disabled. ive never regretted this. shes never lied to me or told me anything outlandish about other staff, and she has no problem tidying up (she wont come out of her bedroom to do so with staff shes uncomfortable with, though).\n\n  \n  the problem im having is with my coworkers. not all, but a good amount of them bad mouth sammy regularly. at the switchoff between shifts you and the staff after you go over what happened that shift and any relevant information about medications or the clients needs. there are two staff in particular who use this time to complain about sammy. i usually politely shut them down and defend her when they go too far. its extremely annoying and disrespectful, but i bare it because i know saying too much will affect how they treat her. \n\n  \n  recently sammy had a pretty serious fall, and has a severely injured back and leg. shes much less mobile and is in a lot of pain, and therefore needs help around the house much more often than she usually does. ive found many of her regular staff is not taking this seriously. theres one planning outings that sammy didnt ask for (all outings are picked by the client, and we cant force them to do things they dont want to) and cant really go on, because she cant stand for very long. theres one who tries to deny sammy when she asks for help cleaning and cooking because she \"can do it herself\" but caved and helped when sammy was on the verge of tears from being in pain. theres a new one who flat out denied sammy when she asked if she could make her some eggs because \"im not going to let you take advantage of me. i was told youd try this and im not falling for it\". all of them have expressed to me that they think shes overexaggerating the pain shes in and ive told them flat out that 1. she cries in her sleep because of the pain (these are morning staff, so they dont know that), so im pretty inclined to believe her and 2. its not our place to decide that. she has doctors who have prescribed strong pain medication and shes scheduled for several sessions of physical therapy down the line after almost a month of recovery time. right now its been a week and a half since her fall. i have made it clear that she needs extra help while shes recovering.\n\n  \n  yet im still getting sammy telling me shes being denied help. ive spoken to our management about it, who has told me he will speak to them about this, but hes been unreliable in the past and i dont have much confidence in him. ive spoken directly to them, quite politely without assigning blame, and have gotten hostile reactions and them accusing her of lying or accusing me of attacking them.\n\n   \n  theres a line i can call to report abuse. ive done this in the past and all they did was ask the offending person if they did it, to which they said no, and the investigation was dropped. (that persons still working in the office) so it seems i can only count on them if theres physical proof of abuse. no ones hitting her or stealing her money, so there goes that option. \n\n  \n  so what should i do about this? i just want to help this young woman. i was under the assumption that thats literally all my job is. it breaks my heart to see her treated like this and having the people in charge ignore it. the only help i ever get is from her case manager, but theres little she can do about how the company operates and trains staff. it seems all i can do is be the annoying bitch coworker who tells everyone theyre breaking the rules. im willing to be that person for sammy",

I worked for a year in IT and am now taking a break and considering what to do next.\n\nMy job left me burnt out, balding (IM A WOMAN) from stress, and my eyesight has gotten severely worse.

    "text": "I quit my job AITA? Okay let me start by saying I am not the best story teller but here we go….\n\nI recently just started working at a job (ophthalmology) not to long ago I’d say about 4 months. I recently just quit literally less than 24 hours ago. The doctor who owns the practice is begging for me to come back. \n\nNow, my manager who hired me is a woman. She is very set in her ways I knew her from when I was younger I played soccer with her daughter so when I came to work for this company I was actually excited because I knew her so I thought it would be perfect a great place to work. Little did I know…\n\nOnce I started working a lot of people were telling me to be careful what I say or tell her. Literally EVERYONE said she calls the woman there fat, tells them they can not wear certain outfits because of how heavy they are, that they need to lose weight. States how people shouldn’t have kids if they are not married etc. I have witnessed a few encounters but tried to stay in my lane since this practice has no HR well the manager is the HR it’s privately owned, so the manager is everything payroll, HR, manager. Now there have been way more incidents but this was my final straw.\n\nSo I recently found out I was pregnant I went in yesterday morning and had a good 15 minute conversation about how I was pregnant etc. she seemed fine and sent me on my way. So Mondays we have zero patients that’s our day where we unfortunately prep charts due to everything still being paper and if I have any patients at all I’ll do labs and or refractions. So I had 2 refractions that day and my other coworker we will call Becky had labs they wanted me to follow her for labs when I didn’t have patients okay fine, she had one lab in the morning and that was at the same time I had my refraction patient. So I took my patient she took hers we went back to prepping charts which we are 2 weeks ahead working on the 3rd we had absolutely nothing really to do until the afternoon. So I worked on my charts for the following week. Lunch came around and I left for 5 minutes to run outside to tell my husband I finally grew the balls to tell my manager I was pregnant I didn’t want other coworkers to here me it’s none of their business. As I walk back in I begin to make my lunch and use the restroom my manager walks in probably after 5/10 minutes and tells me to come speak with her. She proceeds to tell me I am taking way to many breaks I’m only allowed to have One in the morning, our 15/20 minute lunch and one in the afternoon. I’m looking at her and said well you’re giving me more breaks then I actually took she proceeds to tell me and lie straight to my face that she stood there counting the minutes I went outside and I was gone forever? And on top of that I am taking way to many breaks, I’m now looking at this lady like she has 6 heads. I told her I wasn’t gone that long I apologized and that was that. I was infuriated, well my coworker Becky comes up to me maybe 15 minutes after this conversation with my manager and tells me my head tech Laura who I am very close with told Becky that she just went up to our manager to inform her on me disappearing throughout the entire day, Becky looks at her and says why would you do that she hasn’t been disappearing and pretty much leave her (Becky) out of it. Becky also then tells me they are upset because I wasn’t following her this morning for labs when there was only ONE and I was with a patient doing a refraction that I was told to do? I can’t be in 2 places at once?? So when Becky tells me this I then go to Laura and confront her by saying is there and issue with me? Anything she would like to talk about Laura looks at me like I have 6 heads and tells me NO?! I then say are you sure because from what I have heard I am disappearing. Laura then looks at me and says oh yeah I don’t think that, that’s what everyone else is saying?! That it’s not her (Laura’s)  job it’s our managers job to speak with you on those concerns. I literally looked at her and said “wow okay I obviously have a lot to think about I left went back to my room and just finished charts and labs. The entire rest of the day I literally had the manager interrupting my refraction to check if I was in the room if I even went to the bathroom she followed. I’m not 10 I won’t be followed around work clearly she doesn’t trust me and on top of that she lied right in front of me and lied about something so small I never was gone long I went outside for 5 minutes that was literally the length of my phone call when I came back in the manager wasn’t there timing me she came in after 5/10 minutes. I don’t want to work for a company where I am being followed around all day and lied on if she can lie about something so small what else can she accuse me of?\n\nNow side note Laura has told me multiple times that if there is ever an issue or anything to come to her because our manager sucks and doesn’t know how to manage. My response to her was okay I have also told her if I ever do anything wrong or mess anything up please come to me I will fix it right away and if I don’t you can go straight to the manager. She respected that and agreed. Now laura has no issue barking orders and telling people this is her area her techs and our manager doesn’t get involved over here because this is her area but then runs to the manager and tells her lies about me leaving she should have done her research and at least asked me or even just said hey I heard you were taking a lot of breaks not sure if you are or not but try to be mindful of your breaks. The craziest part is when I asked her she literally said she had no issue everyone on my team had no problem with my work ethic or disappearing but then we run to the manager and complain about me for what?",

I said, \"Well, it's a job. It pays the same amount as my previous job. I don't know what I REALLY want to do as a career, but this is helping me during a transitional phase.\" \n\nI hinted to my coworkers very early on that I would be moving to the west coast, but wasn't sure entirely when or how. Told my boss early this year when I came back from vacation and she was just relieved I didn't just call her and quit like our office manager did in the middle of December. I've joked about going on lunch break and never coming back, but I've always been the type to have a binder of important things to refer back to. It's been helpful to my coworkers. \n\nAnyways, I am not particularly attached to my coworkers but have gotten to know most of the patients who have walked through our doors. I've encouraged and congratulated some on finishing their radiation therapy, coo'd over their first grandsons with them, let another have an impromptu grieving session, gave advice for patients who have thrown their back out (and told them I wouldn't expect them to drive let alone come for a dental cleaning?)...and all of them remember my name and have told me thank you, personally. I've had a few tell me that they didn't want me to leave, because they felt so safe around me. I am not a doctor, I don't do anything clinically, so it feels very humbling to know patients come to me because they trust me. \n\nAnyways, while my company and office are going through the transitional phase of getting folks into my office to replace my old office manager and myself,  I am starting to feel kind of sad. Like, yes it's my choice and I was jubilant announcing my move and the euphoria of leaving the most dismally lit front office is still exciting, I am struggling to understand why I'm reluctant to leave or say goodbye to the other patients I've really grown to care about. (They also have mentioned they liked me the most out of all the receptionists there and one woman actually asked me not to go 🥺...) \n\n\nHow do I make the most out of the next few months both for my coworkers and our patients? Mostly for my patients?",

I love her sooooo much to the point it hurts 😭\n\nHowever.\n\nThis is the most Caucasian baby I’ve ever seen.  She’s whiter than my husband, and she has BLONDE HIGHLIGHTS.  She also looks like my husband minus her nose.  She doesn’t have any Mongolian spots, either.\n\nI don’t care that she doesn’t look black at all.  That’s still my baby and I love her more than words can express.  But I have this intense fear of taking her out in public by myself without my husband unless I’m going to the doctor or out to lunch with a friend.  \n\nActually, I went to lunch with a friend a couple days ago, and a lot of people were staring at my child and me with weird looks.  I think if my white friend wasn’t with me, I would’ve been approached about it.\n\nI’m light skinned so I thought people would make the connection that she’s biracial or something but that’s not happening.  I know babies can get darker as weeks go on but she’s genuinely just as pale as the day she was born and those blonde highlights are not going anywhere, so I’m fairly certain the strange looks and assumptions are going to be something I’ll have to deal with. \n\nI’m glad I’m at least a woman because I don’t think I’ll be accused of human trafficking or anything in my area (it’s possible but doubt it), but I don’t want to be seen as “the nanny” or when she goes to school, people think I’m her stepmom or something, which would really piss me off considering I work in education already but from my own behind the scenes experience, that’s going to be an issue, too.\n\nI don’t know if I’m looking for advice but just wanted to bring this up as a topic to see if anyone else has had to face this.  I actually took photos of her birth certificate and have photos of her birth in case I get questioned about it because some reports me to police or something.",

I’m talking same towering height, same fuck ass bob wig, and even similar build. \n\nWhen I chose the doctor online, I saw her picture, but her hair was a natural low afro and I could see her full face whereas today she wore a mask which accentuated her eyes and they also looked just like my mother’s. They even had the same HANDS. It was just straight up eerie and I felt triggered like I was a little girl again in front of my mother.\n\nI really could have gotten past the fact that she looked like my mother had the way she acted towards me not been just like my mother.\n\nThis doctor talked to me like I was stupid in the most condescending tone and had already made up what she believed my best course of treatment to be without considering my input and concerns at all. Just no bedside manner whatsoever. I felt so bad and confused in the moment that I felt like I couldn’t even speak up for myself anymore because that’s how triggered I was by the interaction.\n\nI guess I was ultimately hoping for some sort of unspoken instant connection or understanding as a Black woman patient from a Black woman doctor, seeing as how difficult it is a Black woman to even find a Black woman as your doctor at all.\n\nThis was probably one of the most uncanny experiences I’ve had in my life. I will be finding another doctor in the meantime.",

    "text": "The struggle of being a black woman in the corporate world… Hey ladies !\n\nI have graduated from college in 2021 with a master degree. During my last year of college I was in a program that made us work for a company during 4 weeks which was followed by 2 weeks of courses at my uni. \n\nSo I have been working since 2020 in various roles such as product management and marketing in the banking industry. It was 3 fixed terms contrat amongst 3 different teams which allowed me to discover different products.\n\nMy previous job ended in August and I have been travelling since that point. A month ago a previous colleague told me that they are looking for someone to replace someone that left the team (I have worked for this team during my second contract). I thought why not and I decided to reach out to my ex manager. He was happy about it and said that he would talk to the director about it. \n\nI had left things well with her so I thought it would be okey. I have never had a bad review and the feedback was always positive.\n\nThis morning, my ex manager told that the director refuses to recruit me because of the senior manager of the team that I use to work with during my last position. \n\nI was highly surprised because I have never gotten any negative feedback from her. She is not well liked and has had cases built against her in the past. She tracks everything that everyone does on the team to the point of calling you if your teams status has been off for too long. \n\nShe said to the director that she could never reach me during my time there which is not true. The only instance was one morning when I was at a medical appointment and the doctor took me in late. This was a recurring appointment that I had and my manager was okey with it. This day he was off so when the appointment ended I ran home.\n\nWhen she called me I’ve picked up immediately , apologized and said that I was on my way home. I didn’t plan for the appointment to start late and I don’t have a professional phone so I couldn’t reach anyone on teams or anything. And honestly, I didn’t think that it would matter for 15 minutes. \n\nSo this is why my work is getting questioned and I am very disappointed because nothing has ever been said to me and I don’t want that « reputation » to follow me at the beginning of my career.\n\nI really don’t understand why a single mistake would make her say literally « no way » to my recruiting.\n\nI am so disappointed as I have given my whole on every task that was given to me. I feel like that as black woman, there is no space for mistake and you get written off so quick…\n\n(Oh and that senior manager has also made a racist joke in the past but I don’t want to jump to conclusions)",

    "text": "Black women with ADHD? Anybody Black women with ADHD want to talk about their symptoms? I've listed my story below. How do y'all like being on Adderall? How did you know you had ADHD and go about being diagnosed?\n\n\\----\n\n25, Black, F\n\n  \nThroughout my entire life, I have not been diagnosed or tested for Autism or ADHD. I've always excelled in school and even did extracurricular activities outside of school. Once I got to high school, my grades slipped a little, not because I wasn't smart, but because socially, I hated my environment (I went to a PWI high school, I'm Black and there were very few Black people in my class, let alone school). \n\n  \nI went to college and my grades were mid even though I made Dean's List my first year. They slipped because I focused more on my art and creating videos than trying to do homework and truly pay attention in class. Mostly because I already understood a lot of what I was learning innately.   \nI do think I have symptoms of ADHD. I also know that being a smart Black woman, they were not checking for ADHD in young Black girls who were excelling academically and socially. I mask a lot because I am very aware of the world and what's going on around me. I am very smart and I catch on to systems, procedures, and social situations very quickly. \n\n  \nI smoke weed recreationally, but my friend who is prescribed Adderall gave me a 20mg and I am getting work done without stopping, without overthinking, I'm getting things done on my list. I feel extremely productive. I have never been on medicine for behavioral reasons. I believe that Adderall will really benefit me. \n\nI am now in the process of a career upgrade, moving to a major city, and in the process of applying to. graduate school. I am also a writer and it does get difficult for me to focus and stare at a screen and create for hours on end.\n\n**I believe I have ADHD/Autism because:** \n\n1. 0 time awareness. I will know what time I need to leave the house, and still leave late. I just wait and wait and wait for absolutely 0 reason. \n2. Overthink, all the time for no reason. I know I am confident, but that doesn't always manifest that way \n3.  I have a younger brother who is diagnosed with Autism and Asperger. I read it's heredity and inherited through the father and I believe my dad has it too. He was in denial of my brother. My dad and I are more social than my brother, but I believe we have a little bit of it too. I am fine with that, I just want to be able to function without losing my mind\n4. Hard for me to focus, especially on things I don't care about. \n5. I say exactly what I am feeling and thinking when situations annoy me\n6. Anxious, frequently, even when I don't want to be\n7. I have 3-5 close friends, the same people I talk to everyday\n8. Hyperfocus: movies & tv, I can tell you all about it\n9. I fill awkward silences with sound effects, echos, noises, TikTok sounds \n10. I love doodling the same doodles\n11. Creature of habit: I will eat the same thing, wear the same kind of outfit/colors, for weeks on end  \n\n\nI have a doctor's appointment/annual physical this Friday. I write on my form that the only drug I do is weed, which is true. I love being open with my doctors. She asked me how I handle stress, and I told her I breathe and think, which is true, but I know Adderall would give me the boost I need.   \n\n\n**Questions:**  \n1) Can my primary care physician prescribe me Adderall?  \n2) How do I go about being diagnosed with ADHD?  \n3) What would I have to say to be prescribed Adderall?   \n4) How do I bring it up to my doctor?",

    "text": "Black people and forgiveness: my mom told me I can’t forgive My dad used to treat my mom really badly and my mom would often come to me for emotional support. When I asked her why she stayed with him, she’d say “Because I can forgive! You can’t forgive!” \n\n\n-He cheated on her at least 5 times unabashedly and unapologetically.\n-He put her in a chokehold when she confronted him about his cheating.\n-He started a business in her name to get minority business grants and ran that business into the ground (my mom was black; my dad is white).\n-He’s voted for Trump.\n-He picked fights with her on the way to Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners to make her look like the angry black woman.\n\nBut something is wrong with me because I ask her why she continued to allow herself to suffer? I see other women who’ve been treated like this or sometimes not even 1/4 as bad as this get divorced and I realize this is not normal. I just don’t understand.\n\nAnd now that my mom is dead, my dad has been using all the energy he used to abuse her to abuse me, usually financially.\n\n-He found out I inherited some of my mom’s pension (not because I told him but because he could tell through the type of envelope I got in the mail). He asked me how much I got, I told him I didn’t know, he told me I was lying and I showed him the letter that had no specified amount. He went to the pension office to see how much I was getting and they told him it was confidential so he asked his sister to go through my mom’s mail to figure it out.\n-when he found out how much I was getting, he told me how much and told me i could buy a car. I told him I already had a car and he said “That’s my car.” He said my mom’s car belonged to him and I could buy it from him (even though he had a car and I used her car to take her to appointments)\n-He told me I needed to “hurry up and get well” so I could “help out around the house” after I broke my ankle only a month after my mom’s death.\n-he kicked me out of the ICU because I was crying when the doctors told us there was nothing else they could do.\n-Any time I got any money from any kind of inheritance from my mom or from my wages at work, he wanted me to give that money even though his costs were low since my mom paid off the mortgage largely without him.\n-He threatened to have me evicted essentially kicking me out in the middle of the pandemic.\n\n I went no contact with him back in 2020. I decided I had had enough of his bullshit and my life was a lot better after that.\n\nHowever, when he finally was able to sell the house he owned with my mother, he, my brother and their real estate lawyer tried to get me to sign a Quit Claim Deed (QCD) to give my interest in the house over to my dad in exchange for way less what I would’ve gotten as a seller (my parents owned the house 50/50. So because my mom died and she only had two children and no will; I owned half of 50% which was 25%. My dad wanted me to sign in exchange for 5% of the proceeds as opposed to the 25% I would’ve gotten as a seller). \n\nI did not sign and was part of the process as a seller but at closing, my brother yelled at me basically implying I didn’t deserve anything. Since my mom has died, he’s taken my dad side when it comes to matters of emotionally and financially abusing me. When I try to remind him of the things our dad has done, he’s like “Oh yeah…That did happen.” During this argument, I told my brother that he chooses to forget the bad things our dad did. He says “I don’t forget, but I forgive.”\n\nIt feels like the black people in my family keep telling me I don’t forgive but the way I see it is they’re angry at me for not accepting my dad’s abuse.\n\nAnd my brother really does seem just delusional when it comes to my dad. He said “Dad wants the best for you. You’d know this if you just talked to him.” But if you look at the situation logically, my dad has shown that he does not give a shit about me. Nothing I tell my brother will change his mind. And it feels like he wanted to punish me for trying to break free from my dad.\n\nHave you experienced anything like this in your family? Why is the expectation of forgiveness pushed on or by black people? I feel like white men don’t deserve anymore forgiveness from black ppl. And I feel like black ppl in my family use the concept of forgiveness in such a toxic way.",

I ask because I recently visited a new doctor(white) and her nurse(black) left a bad taste in my mouth during our short interaction. First off instead of trying to say my name she just called out to the waiting room for \"the lady\" to come up. Now my name isn't \"lady\" so I was confused as to what's going on and thought she couldn't be talking about me but sure enough she was. Then later on when she was doing preliminary intake stuff she was very curt which I didn't care too much about until she was being very pushy, rude, and tactless about asking if I was depressed. It was honestly just weird and I know I was looking at her like wtf so she curtly responded \"it's just a page I have to get through\" before leaving. I had a friend with me and after the nurse left they were also kinda baffled by how weird she was. Later on when I saw the doctor she also asked about depression but she did it in such a kind and compassionate way that it made the nurses questioning seem even worse. For the record I'm **not** planning to make a fuss over this because everyone has off days but it got me wondering what I'd do if my future interactions with this nurse became worse. \n\nSo that brings me to my question: what do you all do when you have an issue with another black woman in a professional setting?",

    "text": "ATIA for not cleaning up after my family? I was going to post on AITA but I feel like being in a black family there is a cultural component that gets glazed over there\n\nSo I moved into my grandparents house after losing basically everything and my grandpa said they could use help getting him to his various doctors appointments because my grandma works overnight shifts. \n\nI move in, I take him to all of his appointments, make him food when he wants, go to the store for him, etc. I was even buying groceries for the whole house at one point because I have food stamps and felt like I had to contribute in some way because I didn't have a job. \n\nInitially I was eating whatever my grandma cooked but their southern diet is a lot different from what I eat and cook for myself on a regular basis. Usually she would cook and I'd clean whatever dishes there were because my mother raised us to do the dishes if you weren't the one cooking. \n\nAfter a couple weeks I felt like it was messing with my health. All the extra salt and constant meat 2-3 times a day had me feeling lethargic and I would often wake up with bloated feet and hands, so I decided to just cook my own stuff separately. I love Italian food, asian cuisine, and Indian food the most and often only eat meat once a day because it makes me feel better and is good for the environment too.\n\n Once I started cooking my own meals I still cleaned up after myself I just didn't clean up after them. In my mind I'm not eating the same things you are so as long as I clean up after myself that should be fair. I constantly walk into the kitchen to cook my own meals and they'll be food out from the night before still on the stove and dishes piled into the sink. For a while I just ignored it but it bothers me so much to come into a dirty kitchen, especially when I want to cook something. My parents are extremely strict and as kids we had to have the kitchen sparkling clean at all times and have food put away right after eating it. So now I cook for myself and do the dishes basically because it's triggering and I've seen multiple roaches and that just freaks me out, I have to clean it to feel comfortable living here. \n\nAnother thing that occurs is my male cousin who is the same age as me never cleans the bathroom. We are both 25 so imo you should be responsible to clean up areas you dirty. When I moved in the bathroom was filthy, the tub had a black ring of dirt and it needed a new liner because it was that gross. I started to clean it every other week because in my mind we are two adults sharing a bathroom, I'll clean it for one week, you clean up the other week boom bathroom is always clean. Only two of us use this bathroom because my grandpa's walker does not fit through the door. \n\nA few months back I had cleaned the bathroom for one week and the next week my aunt who has OCD came to visit. As soon as she saw me she berated me for not being grateful and that \"you should want the bathroom to be clean you are a girl, you need to clean it once a week\". Then she proceeded to deep clean it herself so I suppose it triggered her badly and she was lashing out at me, I tried not to take it personal but it bothered me. \n\n Later I said to her it's kind of a double standard to expect me to want to clean all the time if I'm not the only one using the bathroom. She just said my cousin probably contributes more to the household so he doesn't have to do as much cleaning. (He doesn't contribute to any bills, he cleans only when his girlfriend comes over, and is always sitting in his truck smoking weed all night. My grandad complains he can never get him to go to the store for him for his fresh fruit and bread) Then I brought up that I have contributed about $800 to the groceries and was doing most of the cleaning before I got sick for two weeks from having to withdraw from a medication I'm on. Then she didn't have much to say except that I was stressing out my grandparents and I need to do more around the house. \n\nTo me I feel a bit played, you said you needed help with this one thing but expect me to be a live in maid in actuality. I have no problem cleaning up after myself and regularly cleaning spaces I use but if I'm the only one cleaning it then wtf did y'all do before I moved in? Everyone in the house is an adult and my grandpa is the disabled one, I always clean up after him of course so who am I stressing out? \n\nI think they just complain about me to him and cause stress because I'm not doing everything I'm doing when I moved in but I have a job now that's stressful so I can't play maid everyday. They still leave the kitchen messy and I still clean their mess, cook for myself and make sure the kitchen is spotless. I'm getting tired of their communication style, they said they need help with one thing and then expect other things without ever saying that's what they wanted. It's just frustrating and I don't know how to communicate with them anymore I just say hey when I see them and leave it at that because they tire me out with the mental gymnastics. \n\nSo I type all this out just to ask for y'all's opinion, am I being overdramatic? Should I be cleaning more? I feel like because I'm a black woman that's where all these expectations come from but I feel like it's unfair to me.",

    "text": "Issues with manager I work in an international company and joined my team 10 months ago. At the time I joined, we were severely understaffed and I was also the only person of colour. \n\nFrom the get go its been obvious my manager doesn’t like me. Now, I don’t need her to like me but I do want to be treated same as colleagues.\n\nWhen I called in sick at that time, she would bluntly apologise to the group but it was written in a very cold way. In a way that was COMPLETELY different to how she reacted when a colleague called in sick (there would be a ‘hope you feel better soon! Xx’ type thing about the colleague.\n\nNow also within my team there were instances of obvious discrimination. For example, if something wasn’t my fault, I’d be blamed and the reaction would be cold and unforgiving, whereas once it was ascertained that it was another colleague who messed up and I was just trying to fix the problem, all of a sudden its not a big deal. I would also be ‘called out’ in front of everyone in such a demeaning way.\n\nBack to the manager, I think due to her own projections, her assumption was that if I’m black, people on my team won’t be friends with me. But I’ve actually made friends with quite a fee on the team. One is a lovely lovely woman (who’s now left as of a month ago) who told me that my manager told her ‘when I feel people aren’t a good fit, I push them out’. \n\nAnd thats exactly what I knew she was doing for ages. She had me on an ‘informal’ PIP which after I complained she took me off. I said I had some of the best results on my team so that didn’t make sense. \n\nAlso, and now we get into more grey territory- for the last year, no idea why, but I’ve been getting sick more often. In the last 10 months, I’ve had 17 sick days which has resulted in a bradford score of 800. \n\nBut here’s the thing, there were a couple of days when I felt sick but still felt ok-ish to work and just let my manager know so she knew I might not be working to 100% capacity. But she pushed me to log off and take a sick day. So I thought she was doing it to be nice but now not sure, as now I’ve been told if I take more sick days I’ll face a first stage disciplinary meeting or something.\n\nThing is, I know colleagues who’ve taken the same sick days or more and asked if they’ve received similar communication and they haven’t.\n\nMy manager says its out of her hands and that the wellness officer is in charge and is monitoring. And that the operational managers AND VP are cc’d into those emails. And said my name ‘keeps popping up’.\n\nBear in mind the days are bunched up.\n\nSince the beginning, as written above, she insinuates I’m lying. When I went to A&E on boxing day, I asked the doctor for a note explaining my manager doesn’t trust me and he told me to shoe my ECG scan which has the date and time on it. \n\nThing is for example, when I had 26th and 27th Dec off due to a gallbladder attack, I also had previously booked 28th-30th off for my bday. But my manager keeps insinuating that I may have lied to get extra days off. \n\n\nAlso are 5 lates in 12 months really bad? I had a valid reason for them all. One time, tyre was flat on my way back home from another city that morning, another time I had a gall bladder pains until 8am so didn’t sleep but was due to start at 9 and overslept (only timr ive overslept). \n\nA colleague funnily said my life is like a series of unfortunate events.\n\nIt just seems like my colleagues in my team are allowed to have human issues but I’m not.\n\nAny advice? Please be honest, I’d really like constructive feedback :)",

    "text": "I fail to see how being male is a good thing in modern society. Other then not having to deal with periods, becoming pregnant and not being safe to walk in a dark alley or a park during night time i fail to see how its not a massive disadvantage to be a man in this society...\n\n1. Men suicide 4x more then woman. One dude i know already lost 3 of his M friends to suicide!!! And personally I have lost my brother to suicide when he was 23.\n2. 2.Men are pretty much almost twice as susceptible to end up abusing drugs/alcohol (\\~6% vs \\~12% for men).\n3. 70% of homeless people are men.\n4. Men have 10x + chance to die in the workplace.\n5. Men have next to no social support and networks compared to woman.\n6. Men are 2.5x more likely to develop videogame addiction (probably because real life sucks more for them I know that its a good way to avoid having to deal with reality)\n7. Men don't do as well in school at least not with the modern system and woman are more present in higher education programs and obtain more diplomas then men.\n8. It is way harder for men to find a partner( IMO especially since the rise of dating websites and social medias). I think a good proof is there's way less women using dating apps then there are men, i assume simply out of a lack of necessity in the first place.\n9. Pretty sure woman live on average 8 years longer then men, because life is fair like that lol.\n10. Young woman nowadays earn more money then young men meanwhile young men are still most of the time expected to provide for their families and even be a bigger earner then his female partner. Not even going to get into dating/romantic stuff (early relationship / dating life).\n11. When shit goes down for your country youre more likely to be forcefully enrolled in the army. and when shit goes down in any other situation you're almost expected to be brave and know how to fight and even defend other people, or just having to resolve things by violence when dealing with other men.\n12. Getting fucked over in court and losing custody unless something is terribly wrong with the mother.\n13. How modern tv/ads/movies (hollywood in particular) has recently started to make men look stupid, foolish and inferior, there is almost no inspirational roles portraying strong male characters anymore, now its only strong female characters and they're hella overpowered, they make sure the audience knows without a doubt that they're doing everything better then men.\n14. I don't care if its a small minority or if they have been lucky with good genetics, young woman can use onlyfans if they are willing and they can earn way more in their 20's alone then a doctor or any other top tier job man ever could in his entire life. Meanwhile I also have good genetics and I am young but if I did the same I wouldn't even be able to afford a bag of chips a month with my earnings i bet...  You will say, well woman with good genetics go to modeling and pornography, and men with good genetics go to sports... But I'm pretty sure it's quite a bit harder to become a pro NFL player or something then it is to strip naked on onlyfans or show some cleavage on twitch while licking a plastic ear and moaning.\n15. Woman have WAY higher standards in general and specifically on dating apps/websites where they will swipe a guy positively a lot less often then a man will swipe a woman positively, which means the competition to find a partner is astonishingly harder as the average man. Not even close. I've even heard 2% swipe rate meanwhile men swipe HARD. I don't really want to discuss men swipe rate because I've heard that a lot of them will literally swipe all the girls, not that this is a pro-male argument anyways lol, it means theyre literally so desperate...\n\nI have named most of the reasons why it sucks to be a male, it was a good venting/rant session. I am now ready to recieve the backlash of people calling me a misogynist because I think being a man sucks compared to being a woman.",

(38), through an arranged marriage in 2005. Before getting married, Mustafa Y. had a health issue and underwent a surgery that doctors told him was necessary but could make him unable to have children.\n\nMustafa Y. and A.Y. did not have a child for 10 years. He started an herbal medicine treatment that he saw on TV. During this time, his wife A.Y. said she was pregnant. Mustafa Y. was very happy to have a child and even bought a  car on loan for his wife's comfort during pregnancy. A.Y. gave birth to a girl in a private hospital in July 2015 after the pregnancy period.\n\nLater, the arguing couple decided to divorce. When A.Y. filed for divorce, Mustafa Y., on the advice of his lawyer, asked for a DNA test for the child, saying he couldn't be the father due to his health issues. The DNA test and forensic report in September 2019 showed he was not the father. In January 2020, Mustafa Y. filed for divorce and cancellation of paternity.\n\nThe lawsuits were combined. The court granted divorce but ordered A.Y. to pay 40,000 TL in material and moral damages to Mustafa Y. A.Y. The appellate court canceled the compensation order but  ordered Mustafa Y. to pay A.Y. monthly interim alimony of 400 TL until divorce finalization, and a one-time poverty alimony of 12,000 TL in favor of the woman.\n\nMustafa Y. appealed this decision to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision, saying Mustafa Y.'s  adultery-based divorce lawsuit  was filed outside the 5-year statute of limitations, so the woman cannot be found at fault for adultery. Considering the case file, the man could not prove any other faulty behavior by the woman, so she should have been awarded appropriate material and moral damages, which the lower court failed to do.\n\nMustafa Y. said that he suffered trauma when he learned the child was not his. \"I had a stroke. I was in the ICU  for 20 days during the  pandemic period. During this time, doctors told my relatives that I only  had a 20% chance of surviving. After getting  out of the ICU, I couldn't speak for a while, and I still have weakness  in my right hand. This has become permanent after the illness.\" This incident caused him  about 1 million lira in financial loss. \"I still can't accept this, I can't sleep at nights. I don't know at all who the father of the child  is, but I'm curious. Let this person come forward and serve the  punishment for the torment they have caused me. They can't restore my  health but they should face the consequences.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

    "text": "I just heard a professor named Kathleen Stock say that you are more likely to be suicidal if you're female Let's break this down. Males commit suicide 3-4 times more often than woman, so..  \n\n\nMan: Dies   \n\n\nWoman: Wants to die for 30 years, talks to over 100 therapists about it and thus ends up overcoming her suicidal ideation at age 50 and goes on to live to 100, enjoying 50 years of a joyful and meaningful life.     \n\n\nThe entire field of Psychology: Well, we know the woman was suicidal. Look at the depth of insight we have into her mind from 30 years of therapy! She felt SO open to talk about her feelings and we helped her SO much! Unfortunately though, she did attempt suicide twice. Granted, it's not like she shot herself in the head and got lucky and survive it. On the first one, she told ER doctors that she took a few pills and felt like her life was meaningless, and the other time she felt really REALLY bad about a break up. I mean she felt REALLY REALLY REALLY bad. In fact, she was convinced that she was dying from it! She INSISTED that both of these experiences were bona fide suicide attempts. So yea she definitely checked ALL of our boxes. Poor lady. THIRTY YEARS she went through this! On the other hand, the man committed suicide at age 18 without ever even trying therapy, and so we actually no longer have any record that he ever existed in the first place. So mark it down: one suicidal woman and one possibly suicidal man.    \n\n\nSeriously, how else does a university professor possibly get it in her head that females are more suicidal?",

    "text": "Even When a man is Hurt He Can't get any Empathy I woke up this morning and went on facebook.  As I was scrolling I saw a post in a relationship advice group  I'm in that is catered to women. \n\nA young lady posted asking for advice on what she should do after he boyfriend left her on 'delivered' for 30 hours and then texted her and said in brief sentences that he slipped at work, injured his back and has been sleeping since yesterday. \n\nShe said: \"what do I do? Respond?\"\n\nI am glad to say that the majority of the replies were sensible women telling her not to freak out on him for not texting for a mere day and a half, bring him some food, or just stop by to check on him and offer help. \n\nIf my man was hurt, there's no way I'd sit around and debate responding because we weren't in touch for 30 hours, I'd get right over and make sure he's comfy and looked after. \n\nHowever, there were a few (6-10) comments that made me so...pissed?  The women who wrote these comments were assuming that he was cheating, and being flakey, or being lazy because, \"How hard is it to take your phone and type a few words?\" said by a woman who complained that her boyfriend did this to her when he had severe migraines.  Several women replied to her to explain how awful migraines are and how looking at a phone screen is not something comfortable to do.  Another woman said: \"I'd do the same thing to him but permanantly!\"(as in she'd leave her bf in that situation because he didn't text for 30 hours).\n\nI'm glad that most of the women there gave reasonable advice but reading that comment thread reminded me of how when men get hurt or injured, it isn't taken seriously unless it's really, really bad.  \n\nFor example, my parents are getting divorced.   I've been keeping in touch with my dad and he hasn't been doing too good.  He was to get surgury for a hernia, plus he twisted his kneecap sometime ago and had to get an injection in his knee so he could walk properly. A few days ago, he was at work and his leg gave out on him 3 times so he had to go back to the doctor for another injection.  He missed 2-3 days of work.   His knee does require surgery as well to fix whatever is wrong but I guess he can't afford to take the time off for that so he's going to get a knee brace.  \n\nMy mom asked me if I had talked to him recently and I said yes, and then she complained that he didn't send her his 'contribution' for the month.  My dad doesn't like to have his personal things mentioned to her and vice versa but I thought my mother might care that he's not doing to well and understand, so I told her about his recent injuries and how that will affect whether he can send anything or not.\n\nWell I don't know why I had such high expectations, she did not seem to care and was still upset about not getting a contribution to help pay bills and whatnot, and complained that 'how can he not send anything when he WAS going to help you buy your graduation dress' to which I explained he'd probably sacrifice something to be able to pay for that (which I didn't want, it's not worth it) but that doesn't mean he has enough!  I understand that the current economy is making it difficult to live but it's not so hard to have some empathy is it?  \n\nIt's just so fustrating and sad that some women can't give some compassion and care when a man is injured.",

So, just to have an easy-to-reference, codified treatise on the issue, I'm writing this piece to utterly decimate this commonly propagated liberal trope.\n\nMainstream media presents [articles like this](https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-wage-pay-gap-charts-2017-3) that claim there is a pay gap between men and women, and that it's on the sole basis of gender. While it is true that men tend to earn more money than women, it is absolutely false that it's due to gender bias in favor of men (if anything, it's actually in favor of women). The problem with the statistics shown is that they only take into account median yearly salaries without accounting for any other confounding variables that may be skewing the data. For example, if I told you that the more people drown the more often ice cream is sold, would you take that to mean that ice cream causes people to drown? No, you'd probably say that it's because of ice cream sales increasing in the summer when it's hot, which is simultaneously when people go swimming more, thereby increasing the likelihood of drownings to happen; this shared commonality (i.e. the heat) is a confounding variable.\n\nFor the so-called \"gender pay gap\", here are the confounding variables:\n\n1. This statistic does not account for what types of jobs are being worked, as **men choose higher-paying jobs**.\n   * [*Source 1.*](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.1120.0757) *Demonstrates how women choose different jobs than men because they value and/or prioritize different things than men (e.g. better work-life balance). Because of this, the jobs they prefer tend to be lower-paying.*\n   * [*Source 2.*](https://academic.oup.com/oep/article-abstract/57/3/479/2361925?redirectedFrom=fulltext) *Same as Source 1, but also found that \"job satisfaction of men increases with additional earnings while that of women does not\" (p. 486).*\n   * [*Source 3.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719) *Landmark study; displays evidence that men choose higher-paying jobs. The more egalitarian/feminist a country is, the fewer women choose careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (i.e. traditionally male-dominated roles). Giving greater career choice to women increases (apparent) gender disparities within the workforce.*\n   * [*Source 4.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2525981) *Cited over 11,600 times. Demonstrated very directly that women choose jobs that are lower-paying, and that women are NOT being paid less to do equal work; and this was in 1973, almost 50 years ago. Please note that any discrimination found thereafter is really just residual unaccounted variability rather than actual discrimination per se, as detailed in the conclusion.*\n   * [*Source 5.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243210361475) *So ignoring the ideological bullshit that's indirectly being pushed, it demonstrates clearly that women choose different jobs than men and that it is solely due to their own choice; and that the only time women don't choose traditionally female jobs over male jobs is when they're essentially forced to take the male job.*\n      * *Interestingly enough, this supports the findings of* [*this study here*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719) *(which was a MASSIVE, catastrophic blow to the \"men and women are equal but female oppression and gender discrimination are the only reason why we aren't\" narrative); the researchers found that the more egalitarian/feministic a society is, the greater the gender differences will be (regarding what people will choose to pursue). In other words, when you give women free choice to pursue whatever they want, they will willfully choose occupations/education/life goals that will only increase the gender gap between men and women.*\n2. The statistic does not account for **different positions within a respective field** (e.g. head/lead developer vs senior developer vs junior developer; they're all developers, but different rankings/positions). We know this because it's not possible to know the relative rankings/positions of people's careers if they don't even know what those careers are in the first place.\n   * [*Source 6.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1808858) *Looked at a company from the years 1966 and 1969-1971; found no gender discrimination when accounting for all variables. States that at most, there may be gender discrimination with regards to promotion, but even this is speculative as it is not explained why this may be the case (and truth be told, we already know why this is; I will explain later on). If the concept of a gender wage gap was already being debunked/disproved back then, it definitely doesn't exist now (at least, not in favor of men anyway...).*\n   * [*Source 7.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30038574) *Studies a company that was sued for ACTUALLY discriminating against women with regards to promotion, and found that there wasn't any pay differences between men and women who were given the same job/assignment. In other words, even when discriminating against women, they were still being fair about the pay.*\n3. The statistic does not account for **age** (e.g. a young person may make more money than an older person in a physically-taxing field, older people in fields that would require more knowledge/wisdom to handle, etc.).\n   * [*Source 8.*](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26623) *Generally speaking, workers over age 40 are only about half as likely to get a job offer as younger workers if employers know their age*\n4. The statistic does not account for **job tenure** (i.e. how long someone has been working for their respective employer for).\n   * [*Source 9.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122413514584) *Shows men in general have greater job tenure than women. It's decreasing overall (particularly for men) but there are various reasons for it, many of which are oftentimes advantageous from a career/monetary standpoint, which men are going to be more receptive towards since men typically prioritize money more than other aspects of a career (see Source 1).*\n   * [*Source 10.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831432) *It's in the title; job tenure typically entails higher wages. In recent times, this has been changing within certain fields (hence why it's been decreasing as shown in Source 8 above), but the point still stands overall.*\n5. **Men work more than women**, which implicates in the previous 2 points with men being able to develop greater job tenure and work experience. More men work full-time than women. Moreover, the term 'full-time\" means anyone working 35 hours or more (with some lowering it to 30 hours or more to further skew the stats in favor of their social agenda); this could mean anywhere from 35 hours to 135 hours per week, and I can tell you right now that the vast majority of people who are working an exorbitantly high number of hours are men, NOT women.\n   * [*Source 11.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2015/time-spent-working-by-full-and-part-time-status-gender-and-location-in-2014.htm) *Statistics from the US government. Men simply work more than women, even when comparing men who work full-time to women who work full-time, and men who work part-time to women who work part-time.*\n   * [*Source 12.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2019/pdf/home.pdf) *More statistics from the US government for 2019.*\n      * *\"Among full-time workers, those usually working at a job 35 hours or more per week, men are more likely than women to work more than 40 hours per week. In 2019, 25 percent of men who usually work full time worked 41 or more hours per week, compared with 14 percent of women. Women were more likely than men to work 35 to 39 hours per week: 10 percent of women worked such hours in 2019, while 4 percent of men did\" (p. 8).*\n      * *Women were more likely to be working a part-time job than men.*\n      * *\"Women who worked part time made up 23 percent of all female wage and salary workers in 2019. In comparison, 11 percent of men in wage and salary jobs worked part time.\"*\n   * [*Source 13.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2020/pdf/home.pdf) *Even more statistics from the US government for 2020.*\n      * *19.6% of men working full-time worked 41 or more hours per week, compared to only 10.2% of women who were working full-time. This means that men working full-time were nearly twice as likely as women to work 41 hours per work or more (Table 5). This coincides with* [data discussed at the 2019 G20 Summit](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---cabinet/documents/publication/wcms_713376.pdf)*.*\n      * *Men working full-time were also 2.3 times more likely than women to work 60+ hour weeks: 4.3% of men worked 60 hours per week or more compared to only 1.9% of women.*\n      * *Women working full-time were more than twice as likely as men to work shorter workweeks of 35 to 39 hours per week: 7.7% of full-time women worked those hours, compared to only 3.6% of men who did so.*\n      * *Men working 35-39 hours per week earned only 92.4% of what women earned working those same hours ($600 median weekly earnings for men vs. $649 for women). This means there was a 7.6% gender earnings gap in favor of female workers (for that cohort), and this is BEFORE accounting for any confounding variables!!!*\n      * *Women were more likely to be working a part-time job than men.*\n      * *Although not reported by the BLS, it can be estimated using its data that the average workweek for full-time workers (in 2020) was 41.3 hours for women and 42.8 hours for men, meaning the average man employed full-time worked 1.5 more hours per week compared to the average woman. This adds up to men, on average, having worked an additional 78 hours per year compared to the average full-time female worker.*\n      * *Some of the raw earnings gap naturally disappears by simply controlling for some of the variables. For example, women technically earned 82.3% of median male earnings for all workers working 35+ hours per week (i.e. full-time). But for those workers with a 40-hour workweek (more than three-quarters of all full-time female workers), women earned 87.4% of median male earnings, and that's after accounting for just one variable: hours worked.*\n      * *For young, full-time workers aged 16-24, women earned 94.7% of the median earnings of their male counterparts. Once again, controlling for just a single important variable—age—we find that more than two-thirds of the \"gender pay gap\" disappears. There are tons of other factors like these that go unaccounted for when you hear people/the media talk about the gender pay gap. Keep this in mind from now on.*\n   * [*Source 14.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2008/02/art5full.pdf) *Conducted by the US government. Looks at 12 European nations and shows that men work more than women in all of the countries studied, among many other things.*\n   * [*Source 15.*](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t04.htm) *Government statistics for 2021. Men clearly work more than women.*\n   * [*Source 16.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00197939211045376) *Some people may not think that men work more than women enough to help warrant the pay gap, but this paper explains otherwise (they basically accounted for the jobs being worked and how men and women vary in the number of hours worked within these specific jobs rather than ignoring the types of jobs worked).*\n6. Building off the previous point, **men work more overtime**, and the gender pay gap statistic does not account for overtime pay. And if men are working more hours than women, that means that men are going to make more money from overtime which is higher than your standard base rate.\n   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *This is one of my favorite studies ever. It's just so well-done and is, in my opinion, the epitome of what research is supposed to look like. It was conducted by Harvard University, and one of the authors is literally a woman (meaning there isn't any bias caused by sexism or misogyny on behalf of the authors). It demonstrates a multitude of things, but as it relates to this specific point, it shows clearly that men work more overtime than women (p. 2–3; Figure A.16, p. 85).*\n7. **Men are more likely to accept overtime, and especially when presented without prior notice** (e.g. if someone had an emergency and couldn't come in, and employees are asked if they can stay, men are more likely to accept it). This means men tend to be more reliable workers overall. It's technically a separate point from the one above because the frequency of accepting overtime is different from actually working it (e.g. someone could work a lot of overtime one week and not work it at all for the next 12 weeks, vs someone who works only a few hours of overtime every week).\n   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *Also shows how men are more likely to accept overtime when it's presented to them and that men in general are especially more likely to accept overtime without prior notice (p. 3; Figure 6, p. 49; Figure A.17, p. 86).*\n8. **Men are less likely to have unexcused absences.**\n   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *Women have more unexcused leave of absences than men (Figure 22, p. 65). This further implicates men as being more reliable workers. What's ironic is that men face harsher penalties/disciplinary measures than women (Figure 21, p. 64), contrary to popular belief.*\n9. The statistic does not account for **work experience** (i.e. how long someone has been working in their respective field).\n   * [*Source 18.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2535309) *In general, men have greater work experience than women (courtesy of working more than women); the timing of work experience and overall work matters a lot as well, and since men are simply working more than women, the advantages of this timing will be more apparent in men than women. This study has data directly showing that men have greater actual work experience, potential work experience, and job tenure than women (the last of which relates back to the previous numbered point).*\n10. **Men do not get pregnant and are less likely to leave work for kids** (e.g. paternity leave); pregnancy forces women to stop working, which relates back to points 4, 5, 8, and 9, and men being less likely to leave work for kids also shows more dedication to work.\n      * [*Source 19.*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwao.12506) *The abstract alone states \"mothers with young children have reduced their work hours four to five times more than fathers\". Some of you may say that this therefore nullifies Source 12 as supporting evidence for point 5, but it actually strengthens it because it exemplifies the gender differences that can cause a skew in the gender wage gap myth and highlights the behavioral dimorphism between the sexes. At most, it would only nullify SOME of its generalizability on a year-to-year basis, but even then, it still showcases how statistics can be skewed/misrepresented to provide a false narrative about gender discrimination that doesn't actually exist with regards to pay. Anyway, Source 13 also states similar as well due to the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) where women are far more likely to leave work/not come in, but I don't want to be redundant and keep using the same source even though it's a fantastic study.*\n11. **Men are less likely to take sick days.**\n      * [*Source 20.*](https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/68/5/320/4973626) *Women take more sick leave than men, even after accounting for many variables.*\n      * [*Source 21.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6070205/) *The introduction alone is enough to show that women take more sick leave than men, this is undisputed and has been for decades. This study sought to determine whether there were differences in attitudes towards sick leave based on gender, and whether this contributes to women's absenteeism. They did not find much support for this, indicating that women take more sick leave regardless of societal norms and expectations.*\n      * [*Source 22.*](https://journals.lww.com/joem/Abstract/2015/08000/High_Job_Demands,_Job_Strain,_and_Iso_Strain_Are.5.aspx) *Women take more sick leave due to mental health reasons than men (p. 860), with 90% of \"mental health\" reasons being either stress, mood, and/or anxiety-related.*\n12. **Men are less likely to take vacation days.**\n      * [*Source 23.*](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1019.5400&rep=rep1&type=pdf) *Great study that shows how women take more vacation days than men, while also discussing why it is the case. Has several other findings/key points that showcase male-female dimorphism as it relates to work and the family, and they are very interesting; they essentially prove what is already self-evident with regards to gender roles, despite what mainstream society is trying to push today.*\n13. **Men are more likely to move for a job.**\n      * [*Source 24.*](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol40/53/40-53.pdf) *Shows conclusively that men are more willing to move for a job. They try to say that single women are just as likely as single men to move for a job after accounting for confounding variables, but that's nonsense because one of the variables was essentially how well they like the job (i.e. \"job characteristics\"), when the location of a job doesn't have an impact on how much the job itself should or should not be liked (and if any of you researchers disagree, you will need to account for the Halo Effect to fully make sure that distance isn't what's making them view those same \"job characteristics\" as distasteful enough for them to not want to move). It's as if they're trying to say that jobs should cater to women by changing how they operate so women will like them better, rather than simply just acknowledge that women do not want to move for work as much as men. In fact, it's not even as if they're saying that, they literally suggest it lmao! It's very gynocentric when you look at it. The reason why they say this is because they do not want to admit that the gender gap is literally caused by women's own personal preferences, because then that would mean that the gender gap is normal, natural, and that women willfully make the choices that cause the gender gap, essentially nullifying any narrative that women are victims of oppression and that the gender differences that exist between men and women are caused by men and women ACTUALLY being different. This last point really irks the ideologues. In addition, it would place accountability over the gender gap on women, and women absolutely cannot handle having accountability.*\n      * [*Source 25.*](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/app/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/GD_ResearchReport_MetroMovers_Draft4-1.pdf) *Literally the same thing as the previous source (including all of the progressive diatribes that I dismantled) but with a massive online job search website.*\n      * [*Source 26.*](https://web.stanford.edu/~niederle/CEN_discrimination.pdf) *This one has some progressivism within it as well, but ignoring that, we find that any discrimination against women isn't due to them on the sole basis of them being women, but rather because of beliefs over how well they would do the job. In fact, it shows that people are MORE likely to favor women as job candidates when a negative belief is ascribed to a woman rather than when it is ascribed without the gender being stated. In other words, gender discrimination isn't gender discrimination at all but rather performance discrimination, which is the definition of a meritocracy (i.e. a system in which people are judged based on their merit/how good they are at their job, rather than characteristics unrelated to said job/merit).*\n14. **Men are more likely to work night shifts.**\n      * [*Source 26.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2021/article/nonstandard-work-schedules-in-29-european-countries-2005-15-differences-by-education-gender-and-parental-status.htm) *Government study looking at data across 29 European nations from 2005-2015. It shows that in every region, save for Scandinavia, men are more likely than women to work hours outside the standard 9-5. This coincides with data from Source 14 and Source 17, which showed similar findings.*\n      * [*Source 27.*](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3216/3084) *Shows definitively that men are more likely to work night shifts than women.*\n15. **Men are more likely to work weekends.**\n      * [*Source 27.*](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3216/3084) *Also shows that men are more likely to work weekends than women.*\n      * [*Source 28.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2011/07/art1full.pdf) *While also showing that men are more likely to work nonstandard work shifts, it also shows that men are more likely to work weekends as well, which Source 11, Source 14, Source 15, and Source 17 also demonstrated.*\n16. **Men are more likely to work holidays.**\n      * *Yet again, this was already shown by Source 11, Source 14, and Source 15.*\n17. **Men are far more likely to work dangerous jobs** such as oil riggers, underwater welders, etc. These male-dominated jobs pay higher than nurses and hair stylists on the basis of danger, hence why it's separate from the first point.\n      * [*Source 29.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4880472/) *Men are more likely to work dangerous jobs and are simply more willing to accept risks that jobs may have in general. This is represented by the fact that men make up most workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 30.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfoi2004_chart11.pdf) *US government data for 2004; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (93%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 31.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfoi2006_14.pdf) *US government data for 2006; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (92%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 32.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/osh/os/oshs2008_33.pdf) *US government data for 2008; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (93%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 33.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfch0009.pdf) *US government data for 2010; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (92%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 34.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfch0011.pdf) *US government data for 2012; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (92%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 35.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cftb0292.pdf) *US government data from 2014; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (92%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 36.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfoi-chart-data-2017.htm) *US government data from 2017; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (93%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 37.*](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cfoi.pdf) *US government data from 2016-2020; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (93%, 93%, 92%, 92%, 92% for each consecutive year, respectively) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 38.*](https://www.ualberta.ca/anesthesiology-pain-medicine/media-library/eliassons-wellness-docs/mens-mental-health/a-roadmap-to-mens-health.pdf) *97% of workplace deaths in Canada between 1993 and 2005 were men.*\n         * [*Source 39.*](https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-11/Work-related%20traumatic%20injury%20fatalities%20Australia%202019.pdf) *97% of workplace deaths in Australia were men in 2019, with similar trends from 2003-2018 as well. These are the things feminists will never, ever talk about.*\n18. **Men are more interested in jobs that are scalable**; men are more interested in physical things, while women are more interested in jobs that deal with people. The former is scalable, the latter is not; that means Elon Musk is able to service millions of people with Tesla whereas Mrs. Johnson is only able to teach a class of 30 students per year. This point is separate from the first point because scalability relates to potential growth/earning, and based on the laws of chance, you're more likely to find some major hit successes in professions that are scalable rather than unscalable.\n      * [*Source 40.*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19883140/) *Meta-analysis showing men are interested in things, and that women are interested in people.*\n      * [*Source 41.*](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00189/full) *Another meta-analysis that supports the previous one above; \"patterns of gender differences in interests and the actual gender composition in STEM fields were explained by the people-orientation and things-orientation of work environments\". Basically, even in male-dominated fields, women are overrepresented in service-based and people-oriented STEM fields such as the health sciences, with the trend being found on a multinational level. This also acts as evidence for the very first point about men choosing higher-paying jobs.*\n         * [*Source 42.*](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_aa2018.htm) *Evidence from the US showing this trend with women.*\n         * [*Source 43.*](https://afmc.ca/sites/default/files/pdf/CMES/CMES2018-Complete_EN.pdf) *Evidence from Canada showing this trend with women.*\n         * [*Source 44.*](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/health-at-a-glance-2017/doctors-by-age-sex-and-category_health_glance-2017-53-en) *Evidence from OECD countries (38 in total, with another 10 non-OECD countries included throughout in some data).*\n19. **Men are more likely to ask for a raise.**\n      * [*Source 45.*](https://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/16689) *Men are more likely to ask for a raise; the only exception is when women enter managerial positions (i.e. are put in male roles, basically). It also shows that women are basically worse at negotiating than men (\"less successful\" = euphemism for being worse at).*\n      * [*Source 46.*](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1994) *Women are only as likely as men to ask for a raise when they are explicitly told they can negotiate for one. I can tell you right now that most jobs rarely ever directly tell its employees that they can freely ask for a raise lol.*\n      * [*Source 47.*](https://escholarship.org/content/qt9978v172/qt9978v172.pdf?t=omys3w) *Women are less comfortable engaging in salary negotiations, they're less likely to negotiate salaries overall, and they're not as good at it as men (the researchers don't word this last point this way because it angers feminists, but that's the gist of it). There are many other reasons that they go into as well.*\n20. **Men are typically more aggressive/competitive in their mindset and attitudes regarding work** which helps them climb the corporate ladder more (e.g. you make more off commission in sales because you close more sales due to being more competitive).\n      * [*Source 48.*](https://archive.bio.org/sites/default/files/docs/toolkit/Why%20Men%20Still%20Get%20More%20Promotions%20than%20Women_HBR%20article.pdf) *Upon reading this, you find that women are essentially not as willing to do what it takes to climb the corporate ladder; the report says that therefore the entire civilizational structure should change to favor women, but that's just ridiculous. Why not just admit that women are not as willing to hyperfocus on their careers in the same way as men? Why not just admit that women don't do it because they simply don't want to sacrifice other areas of their life for a career? Why not just finally admit that women are different from men? They can't. And that's a problem for BOTH genders.*\n21. **The top people are always going to be men due to the variability hypothesis.**\n      * [*Source 49.*](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/493921) *Men vary greater than women; when seeing any of the extremes, men are more likely to be represented on both ends. That means the most successful people in the world are going to overwhelmingly be men, and the most unsuccessful dregs of society will also be men. This represents a problem with feminist thinking because they want \"equality\" when it comes to powerful, important, and successful positions in society and say that a lack thereof in these top positions are due to sexism and discrimination (and that therefore all of men and society need to just give women these positions to \"make it fair\"), but they will never talk about the men at the lowest ends of society or talk about equalizing that. I'm not saying they should become homeless criminals and whatnot either (rather they should focus on decreasing the amount of men that are disenfranchised here; but they'll never do that since they would have to admit that men aren't oppressors and would have to actually acknowledge the plights of men), I'm just saying there's a double standard here whereby women want the rights and privileges of both sexes with the responsibilities of neither, all the while blaming men for any (and all) of their own shortcomings and faults.*\n      * [*Source 50.*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886913003036) *Men vary more than women yet also tend to be better on average on measures of creativity.*\n      * [*Source 51.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variability_hypothesis#:~:text=The%20variability%20hypothesis%2C%20also%20known,most%20traits%20than%20females%20do.) *For those who still don't get it, here's a Wikipedia article since they tend to describe things fairly simply and succinctly.*\n\nJust to really drive home the point, I quote the official statement of the US Department of Labor after having a massive [study](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2019/pdf/home.pdf) conducted for them:\n\n>**This study leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a multitude of factors and that the raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action. Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers.**\n\nAnd even ignoring the technical research aspects, just think about it like this: If a woman were to do the same job as a man for less pay, only women would get hired because that would be CHEAP LABOR. And for those who don't know, there's a whole sexism argument that claims men get hired more easily than men (which also isn't necessarily true either, but that's a separate discussion).\n\nThere isn't a single statistician who isn't braindead, let alone competent, who takes the statistics presented about the gender pay gap myth at face value when drawing conclusions. It's only after you account for all the variables available can you really begin to extrapolate true causality, and even then it is still weak with these types of statistical analyses anyway since it's virtually impossible to account for every variable that exists *and* have a full consensus for data rather than a statistic that has a much smaller sample size. Plus, when it comes to statistical analyses like this, you're ultimately seeing how things relate to one another (i.e. correlated) rather than seeing how they directly influence/cause something. The only way to truly test for causality is by running actual experiments with strong controls in place (which is nigh on impossible to do in situations like these). If you take a statistics class or two, you'll learn about this stuff more in-depth. Multivariate analyses are pretty much always better than univariate ones (when drawing final conclusions from, anyway), and it's due to reasons like this where society perpetuates the gender pay gap myth as a social dogma.\n\nIf women can do anything men can do (and \"do it better\"), then why are they still supposedly \"oppressed\"? Why are they still the victims? And why do they need government legislation to mandate \"gender equality\" in order to achieve it? If they were really the same as men (i.e. \"equal\") in all these regards, wouldn't perfect equality naturally occur based on merit alone? It doesn't make sense, and it's simply because it's just not true. Men and women aren't the same, and we won't ever be the same. That doesn't mean we shouldn't be treated fairly—equity over equality, always—but this myth needs to die once and for all.\n\n﷽\n\nوَلَا تَتَمَنَّوْا۟ مَا فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِۦ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ ۚ لِّلرِّجَالِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا ٱكْتَسَبُوا۟ ۖ وَلِلنِّسَآءِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا ٱكْتَسَبْنَ ۚ وَسْـَٔلُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مِن فَضْلِهِۦٓ ۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمًا",

    "text": "I am so so very tired from the overtime I need to work because of women in the teams I work with who aren't functioning. I'm working until midnight day after day and into the weekend week after week. It's all a lie. Almost no woman I work with who has a demanding position actually works. I do it all Such women have the degree (I have it too) or a title in the email signature three-four words long.  Equal, no? Well no. Most of the time, almost always, she won't have a clue on how to do the work her job requires. They will spread confident statements that will sound knowledgeable but if you actually know what they are talking about you will know it's complete nonsense - mistakes and fabrications - they are simply making it up (instead of simply looking it up). It becomes obvious to you after a while that they see their competence not as being skillful, experienced and as a result very effective - but as being good at throwing around the right \"buzz sentences\" to make it look as if they are someone you can trust with that job. They will send you their \"completed task\" and it will almost always be half baked. You will need to do your share - and 50% or more of theirs, you will need to spend more time on fixing problems they created (by never asking how something is done and instead \"throwing something\"), and then you will find out that while they know you are leaning over your computer at 10 pm working to fix it, they are out of office.\n\nThese \"a woman can do anything a man can\" women, holding \"same position as a man\", simply create a facade, a theater show. Mostly the only thing equal to a man they have is the job title and degree - they don't actually have the knowledge, know how to do the job or put in the effort needed, rather, the \"equal number of women\" in such positions is made possible by men doing their own 100% and then 50% of the women's work.\n\nThis is the reality of it all. Not all women in these positions are like that - absolutely not! I worked with bright, hard-working, responsible, knowledgeable women (\"knowledgeable\" means: being responsible enough to spend time looking for all the needed knowledge and making sure you really understand it, instead of relying on mumbling something and on someone else \"taking care of it\"), who will hold their end of the pole with you and won't let go until it's in place, but they were a rare sight. In nine out of ten cases, it would be sleepless nights, no weekends, to do the woman's part and then some (as for men, my experience was that they do their best - each according to his capacity. If they're not holding their end it's because their mother is in hospital, not because they don't want to \\[edit: come to think of it, a slouchy man in these responsible roles just gets replaced as soon as everyone have time to breath again. Maybe knowing this pushes men to deliver while women might get the opposite message - we need you for the body count so as long as you don't shoot a missile at the office you won't get replaced\\]. And if men don't know something they just say it and ask, instead of inventing nonsense that create problems that you need to then solve. Them not minding their \"ego\" and simply asking for instructions saves unimaginable amounts of time). Has anyone else had this experience? Any doctors or engineers here who can tell how it works in their field? (I'm so tired).",

    "text": "Just wanted to share my story of sexual abuse as a male So this happened twenty years ago on a Saturday night,\n\nI was 15 at a friends birthday party, she was 27 and my friends neighbour, she was a high school teacher and was friendly with my friends parents and was asked to chaperone the party as we were drinking,\n\nI ended up talking to her for one reason or another, cant remember what we talked about but i remember thinking it was cool or fun that i was having a drink with a teacher because i was a stupid teenager,\n\nAs it got later she ended up asking me if id like a ride home and again like a stupid teenager i jumped at the chance thinking a free ride is so cool,\n\nSo she went and told the parents she was going to drive me home as i seemed drunk and then she was going to go home herself,\n\nSo i get in her car, i didn’t live far at all, maybe 2km, approaching my street i start giving directions,\n\n“It’s coming up on the right”\n\n“It’s the next street”\n\n“It’s this one here”\n\nShe drives completely passed it,\n\n“We just passed it”\n\n“It’s back there”\n\nAll the while shes just saying in a calming voice “its okay, its okay”\n\nI didn’t really question what was happening as i believed i was with a trust worthy person, not just an adult but a teacher,\n\nI just remained quiet as i think i was a confused but trusted her,\n\nWe end up doing a loop around the back streets and end up pulling into the drive way to her house, i remember thinking maybe she forgot her drivers license or something like that because i was a stupid teenager,\n\nShe tells me to get out of the car and then leads me inside her house, it was a share house, she told me to be quiet so i don’t wake her housemates, she leads me into her room which was the first right in the hallway, she then asks me if id like to watch a movie, i say “sure”, im not sure why i agreed, i was just confused and maybe a bit scared, i also didn’t want to say no to an elder, but also my stupid teenage logic inner monologue was saying “im sure we’ll just watch the movie and then she’ll drive me home”, ”maybe she just really likes watching movies” and other stupid thoughts,\n\nShe starts going through a pile of bootleg DVD’s, the sort in thin flimsy plastic sleeve you used to buy in Bali or Thailand, and eventually picks out legally blonde 2, asking if ive seen it yet as it only came out in cinemas a few months ago, i reply no and she puts it on,\n\nShe tells me to take my shoes off and sit on the bed, i do,\n\nWe’re both laying on the bed watching the movie and about fifteen minutes in she starts cuddling up to me, i just kind of freeze up as she starts \nKissing my neck and fondling me, she starts taking my pants off and then performs felatio on me, i’m just frozen and have no idea whats happening or how to process it, i just stare at things around the room,\n\nShe ends up stripping me naked and then taking her own clothes off, she asks me to go down on her so i do,\n\nI’m not sure why i didnt say no, i dont think i knew how to, i dont think i wanted to be rude or dismissive of her, also with my stupid teenage logic i kind of thought well, she did it to me so i need to do it to her,\n\nShe then repeatedly and excitedly asked if i was a virgin, i had only had one sexual partner previously and I told her no i wasnt a virgin, but she kept insisting that i was/must be,\n\nShe then asks me to penetrate her, i was just a little bit erect, but enough to make it work somewhat i guess, we have sex, it doesn’t last for very long as it wasnt really workable, she ten asks me to go down on her again, i do until she climaxes and she then just rolls over, im just left laying on the bed, not sure what happened or what to do, i just kind of wait until she falls asleep and then i get dressed and leave, i walk home in a state of shock still processing everything,\n\nI get home and it hits me a bit more, i start sobbing as im washing my penis in the bathroom sink, i remember i didnt want to shower as it might wake my parents up so i used the sink to try and wash away my shame, i also remember thinking i might of gotten an STI or worse HIV from her as i was young and stupid so my remedy is to just wash it,\n\nI go to sleep and upon waking think it all might’ve just been a dream, i dont remember specifically telling friends about it on the Sunday but i do remember telling people at school on Monday morning, \n\nEveryone thought it was awesome and that i was a legend, the culture was very different back then, this is when all the teen sex romp comedies like American pie were really popular,\n\nEven teachers found out about it but i assume they just thought it was a lie or something, i remember my female friends being concerned but all my male friends would just give me a high five,\n\nI just considered it as a normal thing that happens for the longest of times, it wasn’t until about fifteen years after the incident that i addressed it again,\n\nFor years i openly talked about and no one ever told me i was abused, they instead congratulated me, it took at least 15 years before anyone even suggested it was in fact abuse,\n\nWith hindsight i think it considerably changed my life, i dropped out of school shortly after, got involved with drugs and alcohol, didnt aspire to higher education, not saying all these things were a direct result, but definitely a contributor,\n\nOne thing that was most certainly a direct result was erectile dysfunction, was never able to get it up again with a woman again until i was 21 and finally bit the bullet and went to a doctor to get viagra, after having healthy relationships with past partners its subsided but i still generally need to take it the first few times i sleep with anyone before trust is established.\n\nA few years ago when i finally started addressing it and not burying the incident in my subconscious there was a whole new layer of pain and questions that got brought up, the realisation that i was in fact kidnapped and abused, the self blame for not speaking up at the time, the premeditated planning, her telling the parents she was driving me home, all dwell on my mind still, probably the biggest question has always been why?\n\nWhat was i to her, what did she tell her housemates in the morning, was i just a joke, something they’d laugh about?\n\nThe final blow was when i finally decided to report the incident to police, zero interest despite the fact that my claims can be fact checked from my friends parents, how would i know the layout of her bedroom and which room it is if i wasn’t in there, why do school friends I haven’t spoken to in twenty years know about it, but zero interest, i was told i would get a follow up phone call and would need to make a formal report with police but nothing ever happened with it, i sympathise with female victims of sexual abuse but i cant help but feel like if genders were released with my story i would at least get a phone call from the police instead of nothing at all.\n\nTLDR; i was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a teacher and i was told i was lucky, 20 years later i reported it and no one cared.",

    "text": "How the field of psychology fails men. (my top 11 reasons based on my personal experiences listed below) I hope this helps those of you in need of help find proper help and I encourage you to share anything you believe will benefit your therapeutic relationship with your provider. **1)** When I was first considering therapy in college, I was look for a straight male.  That was my only criteria and that's when I realized ***we need more men in the field of psychology***. It was extremely difficult to even find straight male therapists with availability let alone a good one. In the end, I end I didn't even end up finding a good straight male therapist. Seeing that [*79%*](https://hwd.health.gov.au/resources/publications/factsheet-alld-psychologists-2017.pdf) of the workforce in psychology is dominated by women, men have very little representation in the field. Considering it's important to find a therapist that you relate to I will also mention we don't know how much of the remaining *21%* of the workforce is a straight guy, gay guy, bisexual man, or trans. I say this to say that a straight man will most likely prefer to talk to a straight man, a gay man will most likely prefer to talk to a gay man and so on for the bisexual and trans community. If you break down the remaining 21% by sexuality straight men are even more underrepresented in the field, yet we make up about [147M](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/11/census-bureau-survey-explores-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity.html) members of American society. ***How can men lean on a resource if we're so underrepresented?*** Seeing that women make up [*76%*](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2011/01/cover-men#:~:text=Data%20from%20APA's%20Center%20for,influx%20of%20women%20as%20well) of newly issued psychology doctorates and [*74%*](https://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2011/01/cover-men#:~:text=Data%20from%20APA's%20Center%20for,influx%20of%20women%20as%20well) of early career psychologist this isn't going to change any time soon.\n\n**2)** As I dived deeper into therapy I realized **most if not all of the language in therapy isn't inclusive for men**. For example, in therapy I had to read a lot of the literature on boundaries. The language itself was mostly written in third person and used female pronouns. In addition, all the examples of the concepts the literature was communicating only included examples with women. I can't share the literal examples from therapy, but here's a [psychology today article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/tech-support/201906/how-to-recover-from-an-emotionally-unavailable-mother) that displays what I'm explaining. You'll see all the examples are from a females perspective.\n\n**3)** [**The field fails to accept that men feel the same emotions but express them differently.**](https://www.centreformalepsychology.com/male-psychology-magazine-listings/men-wont-clam-up-if-youre-male-friendly-a-brief-guide-to-supporting-mens-mental-health) On many occasions I've been sitting across from a therapist that either had absolutely no emotional intelligence or no idea at all what I was feeling.\n\n**4)** [**Practitioners need to be more cognizant of their anti men and pro female bias.**](https://www.centreformalepsychology.com/male-psychology-magazine-listings/landmark-research-study-finds-clear-evidence-of-pro-women/anti-men-bias) Many practitioners believe in ideals such as toxic masculinity and patriarchal theory which did absolutely nothing for me, it just created an anti men, pro female bias which shined me in a bad light without even knowing me.  This eliminated all psychological safety and made me feel like I had to tip toe around consultations with this particular therapist which is not at all how you're suppose to feel.  The same therapist even dived into the patriarchy in one session and went on to spew some anti white man hate yet he himself was a white man. In therapist that had this anti men, pro women bias I noticed a tendency to project their own negative qualities onto me.  It seemed like they truly believed the anti man hatred and projected how it made them feel about certain aspects of themselves onto me.\n\n**5)** The practitioners I saw basically blamed everything on toxic masculinity. [They need to realize that believing masculinity is bad for you is actually linked to worse mental wellbeing](https://www.centreformalepsychology.com/male-psychology-magazine-listings/toxic-masculinity-is-toxic-terminology). The term itself does nothing for men and actually just labels men. A man who has anger issues for example may be labeled with toxic masculinity, yet this is a trait that anyone can embody, but on one will label a woman with anger issues with toxic masculinity. The label does nothing for men and actually alienates the real issues men may have. A man with anger issues may have very well grown up in an abusive home where his anger once protected him from getting hit or he was neglected and anger was the only emotion heard. Either way, labeling him won't help him overcome that trauma. Very rarely if at all does a man actually portray anger issues because he believes that's what it takes to be a man. **The real issue is much deeper than his idea of a man and is often tied to childhood abuse not masculinity.** (this one bothered me so much i'm going to do an entirely separate post on this and why I think the word toxic masculinity is garbage).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6)** Once I gained a general pulse on how therapist viewed masculinity I decided to stop discussing masculinity with them because for the most part they either viewed it as something negative or knew nothing about it. [**Therapist need to realize that masculinity is great and have more positive views on men.**](https://www.centreformalepsychology.com/male-psychology-magazine-listings/masculinity-isnt-toxic-its-the-tonic-society-needs-an-interview-with-therapist-professor-miles-groth) **Masculinity at its core is great, it's about providing, protecting, having a brotherhood, being a great father, and finding a higher purpose to create positive change in the world.  Gender norms and stigmas actually prevent guys from accomplishing this and embracing true masculinity.** With gender norms providing looks like making the most money, owning a giant house, spoiling your wife, etc, while in reality providing without stereotypes looks like listening, going on dates, and chores, but also making a decent salary.  When it comes to protecting you can protect your spouse in many ways (not just the stereotypical way from physical violence) for example, be on their side in public, don’t undermine their parenting, prepare them for success, have open minded conversations, encourage them to be healthy and more while also meaning you know some form of self defense so you have confidence in defending your wife. I wish practitioners would accept that masculinity is an innate biological drive and feeling not just a guys idea of what a man is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7)** So many therapist had assumptions about stigmas that I embodied which was absurd and basically victim blaming.  **Providers as well as the industry needs to accept that men actually are not the ones perpetuating the stigmas or regressive stereotypes.** Why on earth would we perpetuate something that's hurting us? There's some Ted Talks that I found helpful in explaining this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Steph Slack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3WDw-DBKLA&t=676s) talks about her Uncle's suicide and how stigmas perpetuated **by society not himself** prevented him from reaching out, asking for help, and getting the help he deserved. She acknowledges that society doesn't respond in a supportive way to men in need and also pushes some of the stigmas onto men that prevent them from getting help in their time of need hence why they say you never see it coming when referring to suicide. You can't see something you're not looking for. If you have the stereotypical view of man a a night in shining amour you'll never see him when he's not living up to that unrealistic expectation and he'll be afraid to show you vulnerability because you only see that side of him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Brene Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jtZdSRst94) (a renowned researcher on shame an emotion linked to depression) gives a talk on shame and encourages vulnerability. At the 16:38 mark, she references a conversations she has with a man at a book signing. **\"You see those books you just signed for me and my three daughters, they'd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down. When we reach out and be vulnerable, we get the shit beat out of us and don't tell me it's from the guys and the coaches and the dads because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else\".** This interaction led her to start researching shame in men, something she didn't do prior to this interaction.\n\n**8)** I felt like I had to tip toe around issues that disproportionately affected men and I often wanted to talk about suicide and how big the issue is because I was and still am suffering from depression. **The field needs to recognized that there are issues that disproportionately affect men such as suicide, substance abuse, false rape accusations, the education crisis, male loneliness, parental alienation, porn addiction and many more.** In addition to recognizing it, they need to do something about it. Push the discourse forward and encourage colleagues to specialize in those issues because I've seen so many therapist who claim to have a specialty in [\"mens issues\"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/ny/new-york?category=mens-issues) on Psychology Today but actually know nothing men's issues.  It makes sense how under researched these systemic issues are given that mens issues gets [ no government funding](https://bamindex.org/mn00001-2020-22-ca-commission-funding/) because there still isn't a commission for boys and men. There may be a need for research but based on my experience therapist certainly weren't making an effort to educated or specialize in issues unique to men.\n\n**9)** During my care I was victim blamed on two separate occasions for being in an emotionally abusive relationship with a woman. Some therapist I saw didn't even acknowledge that I was in an emotionally abusive relationship meaning they propped up some of the very social stigmas that hurt men.  **Most if not all practitioners need to stop giving into to a lot of the victim blaming narrative when it comes to mens mental health especially suicide.** Unfortunately, this kind of discourse is everywhere making it easy to pick up.  For example, [the big think](https://bigthink.com/health/why-american-men-suicide/) claims:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*“But counterintuitively, about 60% of American males who died by suicide had no known mental health issues, according to a new study conducted by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and UCLA.”*\n\n**Just because there was no know mental health diagnosis doesn’t mean there wasn’t one. It could however mean that there isn’t anywhere near enough support present to help men.**\n\n*“What’s striking about our study is the conspicuous absence of standard psychiatric markers of suicidality among a large number of males of all ages who die by suicide,” Mark Kaplan, a professor of social welfare at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, said in a statement.\"*\n\n**Just b/c there was an absence of known markers of suicidality doesn’t mean they weren’t present. No one just wakes up and kill’s themselves.**\n\n*“Instead, they found that alcohol and firearms heavily contributed to the deaths of the majority of men who commit suicide.”*\n\n**So alcohol and access to firearms is the problem? Sounds pretty political. Addiction has literally been proven to be linked to trauma, but no mention of the underlying issue. Stricter alcohol consumption laws sure but stricter gun control will literally not solve male depression. Men can find another way. Do you think banning ropes will stop men from hanging themselves?**\n\n*“Poring over data collected between 2016 and 2018 via the CDC’s National Violent Death Reporting System, the researchers found that males without known mental health issues who died by suicide were between 50% and 90% more likely to use a firearm and 20% more likely to have tested positive for alcohol postmortem compared to males with mental health issues who committed suicide. They were also 40% to 50% more likely to have been in a recent argument with a friend or loved one, 30% more likely to have suffered a recent eviction, 60% to 80% more likely to have faced recent legal problems, and 30% to 50% more likely to have relationship problems.”*\n\n**Again no mention of the underlying issue being depression, trauma, ptsd, anxiety, and the lack of care.**\n\n*“While it’s likely that some of the males without known mental health issues were concealing struggles, the study hints at a different explanation for why males commit suicide rather than just poor mental health: Men are more impulsive than women.*\n\n**So now we’re more impulsive than women and b/c of it we just jump to kill ourselves? That makes no sense!**\n\n*“This emotional reactivity, exacerbated by alcohol intake and coupled with much greater access to guns (men are twice as likely than women to own a gun), result in far more males taking their own lives.

For example, when it came to sexual assault a lot of therapist had referrals for female only support groups like Mount Sinai but none for men. Although there is an actual lack of resources for men, they should make an effort to learn about the few available and perhaps advocate for more. Some examples are:\n\n* [https://menhealing.org/](https://menhealing.org/)\n* [https://veteranfathers.com/](https://veteranfathers.com/)\n* [https://boystomen.org/our-mission/](https://boystomen.org/our-mission/)\n* [https://www.centreformalepsychology.com/](https://www.centreformalepsychology.com/)\n\n**11)** **You can also add that the field itself does face** [**limits to freedom of speech**](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/07-08/free-speech)**,** this does affect the average guy from getting proper treatment because there's a prioritization of care for the LGBTQ community yet, the average guy already isn't getting the treatment he deserves. **There's also a shortage of care on top of men being underrepresented in the field.** [**As of March 2023 160 million Americans live in areas with mental health professional shortages.**](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2023/may/understanding-us-behavioral-health-workforce-shortage) That means more than half of American's can't see a counselor in a timely fashion, yet suicide waits for no one so you can see how that also screws over men. Many of the issues I mentioned are systemic and why the industry needs serious change before it can actually help men.",

    "text": "Men are apparently privileged in healthcare and general mental health? Where are the facts? I'm sorry if this isn't the right sub to post this on. I'm just looking for anyone to confirm some \"facts\" said by feminists.\n\nLately, I've been seeing an uprising of people talking about the supposed victimization of women in the medical field and general mental health. Men are apparently thriving in the medical field and health/well-being, and women are actively being discriminated against and suffering more.\n\nThese claims are;\n\n-Women are more likely to be misdiagnosed.\n\n-Women have worse mental health than men and suffer more from depression, anxiety, and \nsuicidal ideation.\n\n-Women are usually never taken seriously when it concerns health, and unhealthy symptoms are dismissed as \"menstruation\".\n\n-Women are more likely to have autism, OCD, Alzheimer's, and ADHD. \n\n-ADHD and autism present differently for women and men, and these experiences of disability are worse for women.\n\n-Medical research has only fixated on men, thus their health issues are taken more seriously. Meaning a lack of female-centered research results in poor understanding female anatomy and thus, medical discrimination.\n\n-Women's physical pain is not taken nearly as seriously.\n\n-Literally the term \"medical misogyny\".\n\n\nI would love some unbiased references regarding these claims. Are they all factual? Are only some of them facts, or are none factual at all?\nI don't want it to seem like I'm minimizing women's health at all; I'm simply expressing concern at what's actually the truth. I would just like some clarification because we all know how prevalent anti-male, woman-victim misinformation spreads. If these claims are correct, then I'd like to apologize. But so far I've seen conflicting results (a source saying men suffer more from depression and suicide), and an adequate lack of proper citation. I've only seen a couple of feminists provide reference links- some appearing from a shady site, and another from feminist health YouTuber Doctor Mike in his GOOP video, where he links a couple news articles explaining how \"women receive less healthcare than men\".\n\nI'd greatly appreciate the appropriate sources, because I really don't know where to look.",

    "text": "PSA: \"Infertility\" Hi everyone. I'm a medical doctor and I wanted to comment on a very common misconception that I see on reddit. \n\nI've seen a lot of posts from women (or from men about women) who believe that they are infertile and thus don't need to use any form of birth control. I've encountered women with PCOS, other hormone disorders, chronic endometritis, salpingitis, surgical adhesions, large fibroids, etc, etc who claim that \"their doctor told them they can't get pregnant\" so they don't need to use birth control.\n\nWithout getting into too many details, let me just bottom line this for everyone: IF A WOMAN HAS A UTERUS AND AT LEAST ONE OVARY, SHE CAN GET PREGNANT. \n\nI don't want to assume dishonesty on the part of every single woman who claims \"I don't need birth control because of my PCOS\" but, as a physician, I can guarantee you that her doctor never told her that. She may have been advised that getting pregnant would be difficult, unlikely, or probably would need medical intervention, she may have been told that getting pregnant would be a very bad idea becaus it would entail additional risk. But no physician would tell a woman with a functioning ovary and uterus not to worry about birth control. Unless the woman in question has had a hysterectomy, bilateral oopherectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation - she needs to be on birth control if she's sexually active and not trying to have a baby.\n\nDon't let an unwanted pregnancy happen to you. Contraception is the responsibility of both partners. Use a condom *every time* and make sure that your partner is also using effective contraception. If she's telling you \"I don't need it because of my PCOS, leiomyomas, chronic endometritis\" etc then she's either being dishonest with you or she didn't understand what her doctor told her. In either case, if you can't have a conversation with her about using effective contraception, then it's probably best to avoid having sex with that person.",

    "text": "The ACA covers tubal ligation for women at 100% but not vasectomies for men. What other health insurance disparities exist? I am a woman. I recently had a tubal ligation and while looking into how I could have it covered by the ACA (since it's a form of contraception), I was shocked to find that vasectomies, another form of birth control, are not covered for men.  You might laugh at this, but even the ChatGPT bot I was speaking to indicated this could be brought up as a rights issue because it's showing discrimination.\n\nThen, I was looking at something pertaining to April being the month of awareness for men's testicular health (I write an article each month regarding healthcare) and i noted that while monthly checks were encouraged and it's possibly unlikely anyone would want their doctor examining their testicles, the reality is, there is no 'paid' check that is covered by insurance. However, us women get our breasts checked annually as part of our well women checks.\n\nMen, I would be interested to know if prostate checks (whether wanted or not) are covered as part of a men's health exam for prevention, or at the very least starting at a certain age? I know women have complicated bodies, but it just really seems like men are treated as completely disposable.  \n\n\nI did come across this article on Vox ([https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23190169/vasectomies-obamacare-aca-birth-control-roe-v-wade](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23190169/vasectomies-obamacare-aca-birth-control-roe-v-wade)), so I'm not the only one to have noticed, but wondering if anyone has taken the issue further?",

    "text": "The medical board investigated abuse and told me to sue in civil court before they would take further action based on the results claiming the bar was \"too high\" - I think I cleared it and the moon but I'm always open to advice before I take the next step. &#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hw7r2d7rosna1.jpg?width=3250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0e316ac6c5dad3e36f35a118657378928adec28\n\nIn my last post I showed my daughter was diagnosed with 2 STD's the I discovered during a records request, part of my response to what I found out after going to the police and filing for custody was to file a complaint with the medical board over duty to care IE report.\n\nTo try and summarize quickly - I was engaged to someone I found out later was an extremely bad person - they told me they wanted to have a child ASAP to avoid medical complications from aging (she was 37) and it turns out that was just an excuse as she wanted a child to use a dowry for wealthier men like all her friends had done and was coached it was easier if she wasn't married.\n\nMy only request is that she didnt smoke when she was pregnant and told her if she did and our daughter was sick that was all on her. She agreed and of course did anyway.\n\nShe went from 12 Virginia slims to 6 imported Russian glamour cigarettes a day smoked 1/2 - 12x a day - these have double the nicotine but aren't regulated like US cigarettes so far more toxic - some of the packages feature dead fetuses.\n\nAnother issue that plagued us is that she was raised in Moscow during the Soviet Union - they had factory heating from September to April - so it was basically 85 all the time indoors, she would drink vodka and smoke to keep warm although they have the opposite physical affect as they reduce blood flow. The government would tell people that without their heat they would die horribly, so our house was alway 85 even in summer and she was always cold from smoking.\n\nThis meant my daughter has spent years in 85 degree heated temps with 70% humidity on average.\n\nThe first time my daughter got sick was at 5 months - she was usually in 3-4 layers of clothing in those temps and was fed boiled fruit juice or a formula we later discovered was 45% sugar. She got a heat rash and cried for 3 days - she still has jaundice and spider veins in her face partially from secondhand smoke and lots of salt in her diet along with enormous amounts of sugar.\n\nI wanted to take her to a hospital on our vacation and she refused and claimed her mother was a \"doctor\" and she would call her and handle it. Now I realize any normal doctor that saw what was happening would have probably called CPS.\n\nWhen we got back she went to find a pediatrician, this was a massive mistake on my part.\n\nYears later a friend mentioned it seemed she might have MSBP and I kind of shrugged it off until I spoke to a friend whose an EMT and they told me they see it al the time.\n\nThe condition occurs in 3-5% of mostly mothers who amplify or hurt children for attention and usually find sympathetic people in medical fields to help them. This case of 323 unnecessary treatments to a child in Texas 2018 being a prime example.\n\nShe is the first one to say this pediatrician \"only cares about the money\" BTW\n\nOver the years my daughter has been hospitalized 4X that I witnessed for UTI - Emergency room 4X mom wasn't paying attention daughter got hurt - 3 scars on her face and one on her hand. She also has had a bunch of fevers over 103 and every night got a saline nasal flush while the mom continues to smoke around her all day every day and even makes he sleep in the same bed and hug her in her smoking robe in the morning and before bed. My daughter also had 13 cavities at 18 months from drinking fruit juice with a straw and I had to buy a doc band after finding out her mom was leaving her in a plastic bassinets 12-16 hours a day for 3 years and he head was getting flat on one side that her face was sliding towards as well.\n\nOur relationship ended when I told her that I was going to take our daughter for a nicotine exposure test which is a simple pee test and she went crazy and threw me out - there was physical abuse and other things she did too but thats another thread.\n\nI knew that the pediatrician had taught her how to treat the fevers with suppository and robituson but she started bragging that she was really good at it - I estimate that right now my daughter has had around 100 fevers over 103.\n\nThe police at one point asked me to get more evidence so I did a medical records request and saw the absolute tsunami of problems my daughter had and she was hiding.\n\nThe fevers weren't a couple they were at least 50 between 2014 and 2019 - they were probably even more but were handled at home.\n\nApparently every visit she was told about high temps, dehydration, high salt and sugar and other dietary concerns and second hand smoking dangers and simply ignored it.\n\nMost of these I didnt know anything about until then.\n\n**Atrial septal defect, arterioles, macrocytosis, bull cells, rare schitocytes, anisocytosis, polychromasia, torticollis, hip dislocation, dextroscoliosis, recurrent vomiting, abdominal pain, high fever, gastroenteritis, dehydration, e-coli, infection, recurrent UTI, laceration, hand injury, skin lesions, chills, fatigue, febrile illness, kidney infection, pyelonephritis, kidney cyst, lethargy, viral infection, bronchitis, acute head injury, chin laceration, sutures, staples, recurrent diarrhea, viral enteritis, unspecified viral infection, atopic dermatitis, disfigurements of head, persistent vomiting, high fever, rumination disorder, torticollis unspecified, allergies, asthma, eczema, rash, chills, recurrent nasal congestion, unspecified wound RIGHT finger, viral infection, other viral agents, other specified viral diseases, projectile vomiting, recurrent acute upper respiratory tract infection, persistent cough, recurrent cough, fever spiking, fever unspecified, acute bronchitis, atopic dermatitis, viral gastroenteritis, pneumonia, unspecified organism, cold, viral pharyngitis, unspecified face injury, laceration with stitches, unspecified viral infection with skin and mucous membrane lesions, herpes viral infection unspecified, EBV infectious mononucleosis.**\n\nThe last 2 in particular concerned me as they are STD's which means they are transmitted through blood and fluid - and her god father had previously had told me that he had had both of them previously. This was a major point of concern for many people and the reason I tried to finally and have been continued to try and get a restraining order against him for.\n\nThe worst of everything however comes from 2015 and is not in any of her records or notes though she claims to remember and became quite pale when I asked for the records which she tried to hide from me.\n\nMy daughter had just spent a week in the ICU for UTI - her 3rd or 4th visit when her mom took her on vacation where she was supposed to be kept cool and indoors and instead did the exact opposite, my daughter was outside and sweating all day for 6 weeks basically.\n\nOne day she calls me and says she's not feeling well and as a precaution she is going to see a doctor.\n\nIt just so happened that 350 miles to the north ISIS blew up a bomb killing over a dozen people and injuring hundreds more and said they were hunting Americans for kidnap so after a day of not hearing anything I got very nervous and spent 2 more days trying to call her, the state department got involved, local police were getting spun up, google services had told me her location was off but she was still making and receiving calls and then she calls me and says \"everything is fine\" and 2 weeks later she gets home and while I'm at work that day throws my stuff out - I thought she was trying to steal the house I just spent 35K remodeling.\n\n6 weeks later I went to a follow up at the pediatrician and then I hear parts of the whole story.\n\nMy daughter became unresponsive and had to be sent by ambulance to the hospital and she was resecuitated en route by EMT's - basically she died and had her heart restarted after some length of time I dont know how much.\n\nI also found out like I had long suspected that she was self prescribing Russian adult prescription medication to our 2 year old - she couldn't tell the pediatrician what name, type, ingredients or amounts.\n\nOur house has hundreds of boxes of Russian prescriptions in it - I think her mom gets them from a hospital and sends them for her to sell to other Russians perhaps, I tried for years to keep them locked up so I daughter didnt get them but the 13 gallon trash bags just kept coming.\n\nI did of course report these to the DEA and ICE stopped her once at LAX but failed to search her luggage so, nothing happened.\n\nThe pediatrician was aware of all of this and so much more and never reported or said anything to anyone, not the police, not CPS, not even me and it still continues.\n\nthe Medical Board has much more information than I was provided including notes and after investigating for nearly a year did nothing.\n\nIf i had been a woman I believe it would have been much much different.\n\nI did receive a follow up call informing me \"there was definitely something there\" but due to the \"high bar\" I should sue in civil court and if I won they would continue the investigation.\n\nSo now I am going to sue but I still cant believe that the dozens of people that were involved in this never said or did a single thing and they all knew - CPS / FCS / Option House / The police and on and on.",

    "text": "The \"We're pregnant\" expression is symptomatic of something more sinister N.B : Please note that what you're about to read applies specifically to cis heterosexual couples. Not to say same sex couples can't show this sort of problematic behavior, but I wanted to particularly discuss the issue from a cis hetero couple angle, as one party is always affected by pregnancy, while the other isn't.\n\nI was listening to a podcast where they narrate reddit stories, particularly from the AITA subreddit, when they read a story titled \"AITA for asking my wife to think about the long term effects of her birth plan\" . The post has since been deleted but you can find the body of the text in the comments if you sort them from oldest to newest. Long story short, husband wonders if he's the asshole because he doesn't want his wife to go with a medicated childbirth, worries that it might have side effects on the baby and says he felt ignored during his wife's consultation with her OB-GYN. I was happy to see the comments tearing him a new one, but of course he wasn't happy with them. He even stated in one of the comments that women have been giving birth unmedicated and it's just the natural way of doing things, and that medication may affect that, which is such a stupid point that I will be circling back to in a moment.\n\nThis post reminded me of the expression \"we are pregnant\" that many couples use when sharing the news. I always found it a bit weird. \"We're expecting\" sounds better and is more realistic. During the pregnancy, only one person is ACTUALLY pregnant. Pregnancy is a medical condition that only a biological female can experience (for the time being at least), why make it sound like it's a joint effort? Replace pregnant with any other medical condition, benign or serious \"We have cancer\", a normal response to that would be \"you each have cancer?\" Because that's what the sentence entails? Right?\n\nThis is beyond semantics, because this feeling extends far beyond the language used. Pregnancy is treated as a spectacle where everyone feels entitled to chime in, the father feels entitled because that's his child, the grandparents because that's their grandchild, the uncles and aunts because that's their nephew/niece, and meanwhile, the pregnant woman's needs and desires take a step back, so that everyone can enjoy the show.\n\nPregnancy is a medical condition, childbirth is a medical procedure, C-section is a surgery, the OB-GYN is the woman's doctor, and any conversations between them should primarily involve her opinion about her body and the medical choices she makes. No one, not the father of the baby, not the grandparents have the right to have an opinion, or act as if it should be treated the same as the mother's. Once that baby is born, it is an independent human and both parents or guardians have equal rights, but while it's still physically attached to the mother, she gets to call the shots, and her decisions remain undisputed.\n\nThe husband from the aforementioned story's indignation towards his wife taking meds is laughable, not only will he never have to experience the pain of childbirth, but his claim  that childbirth has been largely unmedicated throughout history can also apply to practically every other medical procedure. Would he be fine getting a tooth removed without anesthesia? Would he be fine with a doctor cutting his appendix out with no anesthesia? \n\nOf course he wouldn't, and it goes to show just how apathetic men and society are to women's physical pain, and the expectation that we should just toughen up while pushing a human being out of our bodies, just so that the fathers don't have to worry about their newborn being exposed to painkillers.\n\nUnless you have scientific data and empirical evidence to prove epidurals are harmful to babies, your unsubstantiated concern is of no value in a birthing room. No, your wife's OB-GYN should not ask YOU what your wife should do with her body, and it's quite telling of those men's fragile egos how they can't handle not being the center of attention all the time. No, YOU didn't make that baby, your wife did. Your contribution is a microscopic sperm during the possible highest point of that day. Your wife's body will forever be changed due to the pregnancy and childbirth, and with all the technological advancements we have today, still risks dying having that child, so you are not putting in the same amount of effort, and are not running the same risk.\n\nThis obviously speaks to a larger problem at hand, which is the lack of bodily autonomy given to women in general, but this particular angle infuriates me, and I genuinely hope more and more people change their attitudes and treat pregnant women and people with respect, rather than like incubators.",

    "text": "I feel Crushed with how Female Pain is treated Have you noticed recently that discussions surrounding mens mental health is talked about in a very caring and empathetic manner? A lot of the headlines are “There is a crisis amongst our men” or “We are failing our men” or my favourite “why the modern men are struggling, why it matters, what we should do about it”.  Their emotions are centered and validated and  is treated like an issue that we ALL need to work on. And I cant help but be jealous when i think about the myriad of ways women’s pain and suffering is dismissed and treated in such cruel ways.\n\nIf you search up about womens depression rates and reasons why women are more depressed then men, there is a lot of subtle blame being placed on us. I read an article recently and they highlighted that women are often depressed because we have “a more ruminative coping style” or that we “are more susceptible to other peoples opinions” pretty much concluding that OUR behavior is what’s causing our depression. I was disgusted by the article because it didn’t even mention the misoginy, bigotry and discrimination we face that surely contributes to our higher depression rates. Have you all run across an article stating boldly “We are failing our women”. I would KILL for that validation that im not crazy and my suffering is valid and real. But nope, we have to deal with the following. \n\nFirstly, I hate how a woman’s pain is considered a fact of life. That I should learn how to deal with the misoginy by now and find a way to accept it. Or that harmful things that affect men like r*pe is more urgent and even worse when it happens to them just because it happens to women more often. It always disgusts me when a man shares his experience with s/a and r*pe and there is an implication by the comments that he’s braver for overcoming it or dealing with that sort of pain simply because he’s a man. Its a slap to the face for all female survivors. Women deserve dignity and safety just as much as men do and no amount of time it happens or history we have with gendered violence will make us more equipped to “handle it better”. People who say “it must be worse for you as a man” disgust me beyond words can say. \n\nAlso, our pain is constantly trivialized and minimized. We aren’t believed when we go to the doctors when we say x is affecting us. This is a HUGE injustice towards women, it’s effectively killing us and we ARENT receiving any help for our real, tangible issues. It is extremely unfair and bigoted that a man can express his concerns to a doctor and be promptly believed and supported but we have to constantly advocate for ourselves, travel the city to find a doctor that cares and will treat us like a human and then deal with condescending disregard from health care practitioners about how are issues arent real at all. How does one overcome something like this? Its absolutely revolting and unfair.\n\nAnd then to continue, there is this implication that women are *allowed* to express emotions and that we are constantly validated and supported unlike men. ummmm in which planet  is this true? Women aren’t supported at all. With every tear that drops, it is treated as evidence that we are overreacting and blowing things out of proportion. And also, when men cry it’s taken much more seriously because men never cry so this has to be a real issue right? This leads us to being more dismissive when women cry because it has to be “just what women do”. When no, we should listen to both genders equally when they express pain . And also what makes people not think that women are not affected by the “crying=weak” trope. Like hello? it doesn’t take much to understand that when men are constantly told that they are weak for crying they are assuming women are weak for crying too or maybe more accurately, women are weak full stop. This affects women. Deeply. Either we internalize we are weak and thus, trivialize all our emotional pain by saying “we are just whining” or “b*tching as usual” or if your anything like me, You cry yourself to sleep every night but wouldn’t dare cry in public or in front of someone else  ever because the last thing you want to hear is victim blaming or looks of pity. \n\nWhich leads me to two other things. Victim blaming is gendered. Whenever something bad happens to women without fail no matter how egregious was the act or how broken she feels, there will always be an element of blame. “What were you wearing”, “why were you walking there at night”, “you shouldn’t have trusted men lol”, “you need to have more self respect and leave your abuser”, “What did you expect??”, “thats just male nature they are wired like that😃”. Its everywhere. non fucking stop. And its taking a HUGE toll on me. Whenever something bad happens to a woman, i cant even bring myself to scroll or engage anymore because without fail, i’ll come across some variation of these comments and the lack of empathy and support pains me to my core for both myself and other women so badly. Its just so sad. \n\nLastly, to build on the “women are overreacting” concept, there is a trope that annoys me like no other trope annoys me. I present to you: “Men are logical and problem solvers”. I cant stand it. When ever womens pain is brought up, without  fail there is some meathead that says “Men are natural problem solvers, so when women just want to vent, men think it through and find solutions. we are wired to fix things”. Omg they need to shove it up their ass. Good luck “solving” systemic misoginy, rape culture, social bias against women, Clinical depression, fear of walking down the streets due to threats of violence, male supremacy doctrines in religion, glass ceiling, pay gap, violence against women, and the weight of pain of subjugation. Like golly, why didn’t i think of that? If they are such “problem solvers” than one would agree that it’s fair to say “solve the male suicide issue problem instead of blaming feminists”. But no actually, that’s not okay. Thats callous and cruel and inconsiderate. So what give you the right to treat women with such  lack of empathy and disregard?  Instead of listening and caring you condescend and provide flimsy “solutions” subtly asserting you think that our problems are trivial and easily “solvable”. Honestly with these sort of attitudes, i’ve refuse to talk about my pain to men , consider that problem solved lol. \n\nAnyways, that pretty much concludes some things i’ve noticed and it has really been affecting me lately . Im scared to talk about my feelings in person  now and i’m not sure this will change anytime soon even though i though i feel isolated.  But I want to tell every women who reads this, that your feelings ARE valid and I care. I understand you. You don’t deserve to feel ANY pain. Im so fucking sorry 💔💔",

She thinks that women told who took power from their husbands or got it after their death are all 'christians' in Hinduism women are good and devoted wife's they even jump in fire \"voluntarily\" after husband death. \n\nI mean literally can't tell her that periods or abortions(she never ever ever said abortion are bad biologically) are not impure, she has a PhD in medicine and is a doctor (high value one), *she recently told told me a story of a girl who got married at 16 as because she hits menopause at 27 as something good*. Whenever I try to use logical facts or evidence for my claims she say I'm a mini version of her mother in law who came here on this earth from her own womb to haunt her wtf she made my brother pray at night even during exam times which I'm sure was voluntary considering how happy my brother was on the day he left the house for college in jet speed\n\nI'm 16f sorry for this rant just had to get this off my chest...

Being \"pretty\" evidently opens more doors than anything else. The fact that 95% of the doors opened because of my looks were bedroom doors seems irrelevant. \"Smart\" is a blessing, isn't it? And just like my looks, it's something I was born with. I was late becoming a woman because I was recruited for university when I was 15 and exchanged that time with my friends for 3 years of practice as a lab rat. I graduated and looked to grad school. It was assumed I would continue on where I was and be used as a research tool until I'd paid enough to be an assistant professor.  At 18, I pressed my luck and took scholarships in the US. Started my first master's, then got interested in another in the middle of the first. Finished them both by the time the 1st semester of my doctoral work began. But I'm smart, so that was little more than having fun, right?\n\nSo what right do I have to say I back feminism, even though I don't agree 100% of the time? I'm \"pretty and smart\" so I haven't earned the right? The battles I won were because the women before me left stepping stones for me to follow, as I have for those who follow me in simple repayment.\n\nI follow the philosophy of the early 20th-century American philosopher, Popeye the Sailor: \"I am what I am and that's all that I am.\" But that doesn't mean I can't improve.

    "text": "Doctors, consent, and infantilizing senior women My 86 year old mother is in the hospital and from the first day her 40ish WM doctor has greeted her as if she’s a child. She has all her faculties (not that her having dementia would excuse his behavior) and yesterday she complained to me that every time he comes in her room he pinches her cheek and says “aren’t you so cute.” \n\nI was shocked and told her to tell him to cut it out if he tried it again. She has no trouble standing up for herself, she’s at an age where she’s not willing to take any BS. So today when he tried to pinch her cheek she told him not to touch her. And he said it was part of his “exam.” She told him she knew damn well it wasn’t and to cut it out. \n\nI spoke with patient services, her nurse, and the charge nurse (and the charge nurse’s assistant who had witnessed the incident this morning). Every woman I have described this to has had the same reaction: wincing, a look of disgust, and an eye roll. They have agreed that it’s inappropriate and I’ve asked they have someone explain to him that it’s condescending, infantilizing, sexist and especially annoying for someone who doesn’t feel well to begin with.  They have agreed to speak with him and have someone with him on his rounds tomorrow (his last shift this week) so he doesn’t make my mother uncomfortable.\n\nI guess I’m wondering is this a common issue? I’ve had bad doctors before…and even one sexist doctor who refused to speak with me without my husband present. But never one that treated me like I was a toddler. Or one that needed someone to explain consent to them. I’m sure there’s a whole host of issues that happen to seniors and especially senior women, but this seemed really weird to me.",

I am getting really burned out and jaded from experiencing this from all sides. From men, I am tired of the 'well actually' and to these guys most of the time ' I have already considered your well actually' so 'well actually' back at you. I am a medical doctor and that already getting assumed to be a nurse (no offense to nurses I am just not one) whenever I say I work in healthcare or by patients. I have also been called 'little girl' (I am in my 40's but maybe look sorta young) by patients and asked to see the real doctor. I have 4 degrees, publications, a CV, and a whole bunch of stuff but sometimes this stuff just gets to me and I feel big imposter syndrome. On the other side, my community is pretty traditional where the gender norm is to for women to remain housewives (also nothing against housewives) and have several kids. Women can be the strictest enforcers of this sexism in this setting, I am assumed to be a lower women because I am not meeting these expectation let alone I am unable to have children due to infertility which is also shamed in this community. I never step in with parenting stuff but there have been times when they ask me medical questions but then it 'well I dont think you know more than me' 'will cut me off when I try to explain something after being asked' and recently ' one of their daughters was having some pain in her arm and it was getting worst' 'the girl asked me a question her pain' I asked if it was getting worse and then they quickly said ' it is not not a big deal just take some ibuprofen and stopped the conversation' a few days later the problem turned in a bigger problem and the girl had to go to see the ER urgently.  \n\nThis is a complex issue, and I want to be responsible and not be overstepping my bounds or making others feel less than but then I also feel this constant feeling like ' women shouldnt be doing this ' you cant be accomplished if you are a woman and if you are you arent allowed to feel like you are' ' women arent allowed to be intelligent and if you are be quiet'. Like it feels like there is no trust that we are capable of thing we have achieved, and as in the case of this traditional community I am breaking some sort of taboo just by existing and doing what I do.

    "text": "The History of Somatic Symptom Disorder, AKA \"Hysteria,\" and how it has shaped the medical field, ChatGPT, WebMD, and its effect on women today. This is separated by sections with titles in all caps\n\nHISTORY\n\nFrom the American Psychiatric Foundation: \" Somatic symptom disorder is **diagnosed when a person has a significant focus on physical symptoms, such as pain, weakness or shortness of breath, to a level that results in major distress and/or problems functioning**. The individual has excessive thoughts, feelings and behaviors relating to the physical symptoms.\"\n\nWhich is further defined as: \" **The somatoform disorders are a group of psychiatric disorders that cause unexplained physical symptoms. They include somatization disorder (involving multisystem physical symptoms), undifferentiated somatoform disorder (fewer symptoms than somatization disorder), conversion disorder (voluntary motor or sensory function symptoms), pain disorder (pain with strong psychological involvement), hypochondriasis (fear of having a life-threatening illness or condition), body dysmorphic disorder (preoccupation with a real or imagined physical defect), and somatoform disorder not otherwise specified (used when criteria are not clearly met for one of the other somatoform disorders).** \"\n\nFrom [ScienceDirect.com](https://ScienceDirect.com) article by  R.E. Kendell, in [International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/referencework/9780080430768/international-encyclopedia-of-the-social-and-behavioral-sciences), 2001 \n\nHysteria no longer appears in the DSM-5 Nomenclature but....  \"The term hysteria comes from the Greek word *hystera* for womb, reflecting the belief of ancient Egyptian physicians that the phenomena of the disease were due to ‘wandering of the womb.’ [Hippocrates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/hippocrates) and Galen both accepted this assumption and until the late nineteenth century hysteria remained a disease of women and of the body (generally the nervous system).   The idea that it was a purely [psychological disorder](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/psychological-disorder) dates from Breuer and Freud's [*Studies on Hysteria*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/studies-on-hysteria) in 1896, which led to the psychoanalytic concept of hysteria—the dominant explanatory theory for the next 60 years. The demise of hysteria was due primarily to the fact that the term came to be used in a variety of ways that were only tenuously related: (a) neurological conversion symptoms; (b) psychophysiological reactions—a wider concept of conversion including pain and visceral symptoms; (c) dissociative reactions—fugues and amnesic episodes assumed, after Janet, to be based on dissociation of consciousness; (d) outbreaks of mass, or epidemic, hysteria; (e) Briquet's syndrome—multiple, unexplained, somatic symptoms and persistent invalid behavior; (f) anxiety hysteria—an obsolete psychoanalytic term for phobic anxiety; and (g) a personality type assumed to be particularly susceptible to develop hysterical symptoms. Contemporary understanding of hysterical behavior has been influenced strongly by the sociological concepts of the ‘sick role’ and ‘illness behavior’ and by learning theory, and attempts to reduce both the attractions of the sick role and influences discouraging healthy behavior now have a central role in management. This conceptual model explains the distribution of hysterical behaviors in populations, including the predominance in young women, and many other clinical observations, but it fails to account either for neurological conversion symptoms or for fugues and other dissociative phenomena.\"\n\nBasically what this says is that Hysteria was created in 1900BC and was labeled as the \"wandering womb\" claiming that the uterus would move locations and the SOLUTION to this was... Marriage and sex... Well... Sex really. Coitus.\n\nFrom  K. Pajer, in [Encyclopedia of Stress (Second Edition)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/referencework/9780123739476/encyclopedia-of-stress), 2007:\n\n\"Subsequent centuries brought changes in the definition and hypothesized etiology of hysteria. The definition became quite broad, referring to nearly any symptom of disease that was found more often in women than in men. Etiological explanations continued to focus on uterine pathology but also included causes such as satanic possession.\"\n\nThis means that any sort of disorder or symptom that was found in women but not in men was labeled as \"Hysteria\"\n\nAlso from K. Pajer:\n\n \"The nineteenth century brought a dramatic increase in the incidence of hysteria, although it is not clear why this happened. Treatments continued to focus on the uterus and newly discovered ovaries. The cauterization of the cervix, leeches applied to the cervix and vagina, and the removal of the ovaries were all common treatments that were only moderately successful. In the late nineteenth century, however, [hypnosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/hypnosis) was discovered to be useful for curing some symptoms of hysteria, such as the paralysis described earlier in S.M. Janet, Freud, and others believed that the mechanism of this cure was that hypnosis allowed the [therapist](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/therapists), and then later the patient, to gain access to repressed feelings. In exploring these hidden feelings, buried conflicts could be resolved and the symptoms would disappear. The use of hypnosis diminished as Freud developed the technique of free association with interpretation by the analyst. This technique became the hallmark of psychoanalysis and was eventually used for many psychiatric disorders. \"\n\nSYNTHESIS\n\nFrom a Sociological perspective, one could argue that the cultural idea of  can be dated back to 1900BC. \n\nHere's what I mean. You all know what I mean. The concept of no one listening to you. It's not instinctual for men to be like that. It's cultural and sociological and perpetuates an idea that's based in 1900BC. Men have not listened to women about their health issues since 1900BC, to the point where they created a disorder that can be used as an excuse to not listen.\n\nThe concept of \"Hysteria\" has effected so many women today. The last mental asylum wasn't shut down until 1996 with Bill Clinton. Before these mental asylums were shut down, men could drop their wives or any female relative off, and they would not be allowed to leave until that same person came to remove them. If that person died, you would not be returning to normal society. Many women were born, raised, and died in these mental health asylums until 1996.\n\nSo that being said: let's chat. Here's the topic:\n\nThe concept of \"Hysteria\" has created a long-standing, sociological, cultural, and instinctual mindset towards the attitude of women, what we talk about, do, who we are, how the world sees us, and most importantly: how doctors see us.\n\nThis concept is so deeply bred into our culture that the language perpetuated by it is often seen in so much of our media, and is so deeply ingrained in us. \n\nGoing back to what Freud said, claiming it to be \"(a) neurological conversion symptoms; (b) psychophysiological reactions—a wider concept of conversion including pain and visceral symptoms; (c) dissociative reactions—fugues and amnesic episodes assumed,\"\n\nWHICH: the definition of visceral means very real, and relating to soft internal organ systems like the heart, lungs, and reproductive system. Fugues is loss of awareness usually \"associated with forms of hysteria or epilepsy.\" Or, for better words, when you zone out and aren't aware of things momentarily and briefly forget what's going on.\n\nSo BASICALLY that moment where you can't think about anything because your period is absolutely so painful.\n\nThis is basically saying \"Oh yeah is she is a woman, is having some brain fog, and she's feeling pain- it's not real\" which is an idea created by Ancient Egyptians, then perpetuated by Sigmund Freud, the \"Father of psychoanalysis\" which was then put into the DSM-5 because of him and USED TO ABUSE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WOMEN. \n\nthis is like when you're watching a movie, and there's not a single scene where two women are together and they're NOT talking about a man. \n\nOr when you go to the doctor to get an IUD inserted, and they don't provide any cervical dilaters, painkillers, or anything of the sort, and just go right in like we're back in 1900BC.\n\nOr when you go to the doctor because you're crying in pain, and they won't give you painkillers even though you're 3 years clean from opioid addiction, and your pain levels are reading as an intolerable level.\n\nSo, that moment when you tell your boyfriend that you're upset about something, and he doesn't seem to care. The father who claims his daughter's period to be \"not that bad.\" The old-fashioned mother who won't allow you to bring your bathing suit to the pool party because she knows your on your period and doesn't want you to use a tampon. The husbands who ignore their wives pregnancy pain and tells them to \"Just deal with it, it'll be out in a few months anyway\" and then the wives end up dead because it was really a medical emergency.\n\nSO Sigmund Freud is the reason to blame for why you never get help for your period pains.\n\nAnything that is sexist can probably be related to this social idea. In a world where men don't listen to women, the world was created for them and not for us. \n\nI recommend reading \"Invisible Women\" by  Caroline Criado-Perez. In her book she examines many of the things in America that you wouldn't think would be attributed to sexism. Like how the cities are plowed first instead of the small towns because more men drive to work.\n\nCHATGPT AND WEBMB\n\nIf you go to WebMd and search for conditions, with anything that is both related to the brain (neurological) and pain (neurological/inflammatory/receptors that respond to stimuli/yes fish still feel pain) and your gender is set to female, one of the conditions on that list, usually close to the top, is somatic symptom disorder, which is hysteria.\n\nIf you set the gender to male, it will show up if you include general pain like \"muscle pain\" but it is usually farther down the list. If you provide an array of mixed symptoms, it will usually not show up.\n\nWhy is this an issue? Because when you go to the doctor, chances are when they leave and come back, they're going to google or look up all of your symptoms.\n\nHere's what I got from ChatGPT\n\n \n\nHere's a list of ten possible conditions that could cause pelvic pain, brain fog, and fatigue in a 22-year-old woman:\n\n1. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\n2. Endometriosis\n3. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)\n4. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n5. Fibromyalgia\n6. Hypothyroidism\n7. Depression or anxiety disorders\n8. Iron deficiency anemia\n9. Interstitial cystitis\n10. Urinary tract infection (UTI)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this instance, it labels Depression and Anxiety as \"Mental health conditions like depression and anxiety can cause physical symptoms such as pelvic pain, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating.\"\n\nWhich, is partially true, but to me it seems like the pain, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating would be the thing CAUSING the anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression is a real thing, but most oftentimes, they are comorbid with something else. (Please correct me if I am wrong.)\n\nI did it again, with better more specific results.\n\n\"based on the symptoms you described, here's a list of ten possible conditions that could explain a woman's lower abdominal pain, difficulty concentrating, warm feeling over the uterus, intense cramps, delayed period, and a false pregnancy test result:\n\n1. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): PID is an infection of the reproductive organs that can cause lower abdominal pain, fever, abnormal vaginal discharge, and delayed periods.\n2. Endometriosis: Endometriosis is a condition where the tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside of it. It can cause pelvic pain, cramps, delayed periods, and difficulty concentrating.\n3. Ovarian cysts: Cysts that develop on the ovaries can sometimes cause lower abdominal pain, delayed periods, and discomfort during activities like bending down.\n4. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): PCOS is a hormonal disorder that can cause irregular periods, lower abdominal pain, and difficulty concentrating.\n5. Ectopic pregnancy: Although the pregnancy test was negative, an ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. It can cause lower abdominal pain, delayed periods, and sometimes a warm feeling or discomfort.\n6. Uterine fibroids: Fibroids are noncancerous growths in the uterus that can cause lower abdominal pain, cramps, and delayed periods.\n7. Ovarian torsion: This occurs when an ovary twists, potentially causing severe lower abdominal pain, cramps, and delayed periods.\n8. Gastrointestinal issues: Certain gastrointestinal conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can cause lower abdominal pain and difficulty concentrating.\n9. Stress or anxiety: High levels of stress or anxiety can lead to physical symptoms like abdominal discomfort, delayed periods, and difficulty concentrating.\n10. Hormonal imbalances: Imbalances in hormones such as estrogen and progesterone can affect the menstrual cycle, leading to delayed periods and associated symptoms.\"\n\nThird try, here's the whole conversation:\n\nChatGPT: \"I'm not a doctor, but based on the symptoms you described, here's a list of ten possible conditions that could explain a woman's false pregnancy test, missed period, muscle pain, localized cramps, fatigue, and emotional changes:\n\n1. Pregnancy: While the pregnancy test was false, it's still possible for a woman to be pregnant and have a negative result, especially if the test was taken too early. In some cases, pregnancy symptoms can manifest even with a negative test result.\n2. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): PCOS is a hormonal disorder that can cause irregular periods, muscle pain, and emotional changes.\n3. Uterine fibroids: Fibroids are noncancerous growths in the uterus that can lead to missed periods, muscle pain, and localized cramps.\n4. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS): PMS is a condition that can cause muscle pain, cramps, fatigue, and emotional changes in the days leading up to the menstrual period.\n5. Hormonal imbalances: Imbalances in hormones like estrogen and progesterone can disrupt the menstrual cycle, leading to missed periods, muscle pain, and emotional symptoms.\n6. Thyroid disorders: Conditions such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism can cause hormonal imbalances, leading to missed periods, muscle pain, fatigue, and emotional changes.\n7. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS): CFS is a complex disorder characterized by persistent fatigue that lasts for at least six months and is not relieved by rest. Muscle pain and emotional symptoms can also be present.\n8. Fibromyalgia: Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and emotional changes.\n9. Post-acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS): PAWS can occur after substance addiction recovery and can cause various physical and psychological symptoms, including muscle pain, fatigue, and emotional instability.\n10. Psychological factors: Emotional changes, fatigue, and muscle pain can also be influenced by psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, or depression.\n\nIt's important for her to consult with a healthcare professional who can conduct a thorough evaluation, consider her medical history, and perform appropriate tests to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms.\"\n\nME: But if she is actually having pain, would that really be psychological? Because if she is stressed, wouldn't the pain be causing her stress and anxiety?\n\nChatGPT: \"You're right, pain itself is a physical symptom and should not be dismissed as purely psychological. Stress and anxiety can indeed contribute to the experience of pain, and in some cases, they can amplify or exacerbate physical symptoms.\n\nWhen it comes to pain, it's essential to consider both physical and psychological factors. Stress and anxiety can lead to muscle tension, which may manifest as muscle pain. Additionally, psychological factors can influence how pain is perceived and experienced, affecting an individual's emotional well-being and overall stress levels.\n\nIt's crucial to approach the situation with a holistic perspective. A healthcare professional would take into account the individual's symptoms, medical history, conduct a physical examination, and potentially order additional tests to determine the underlying cause of the pain. They will consider both physical and psychological factors to provide a comprehensive diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.\"\n\nME: Aren't you afraid that by including psychological disorders, that you'd be perpetuating the old and misinformed idea of hysteria? \n\nChatGPT: \"I apologize if my previous response gave the impression of perpetuating outdated notions or stigmatizing psychological disorders. It is not my intention to promote such ideas.\n\nIt is important to approach health and well-being from a biopsychosocial perspective, recognizing that physical symptoms can be influenced by various factors, including psychological ones. Mental health is an essential component of overall health, and it is crucial to consider the interconnectedness of physical and psychological well-being.\n\nHowever, it is equally important to emphasize that physical symptoms should not be dismissed or solely attributed to psychological factors without appropriate evaluation. Healthcare professionals aim to provide comprehensive and individualized care, considering all potential causes and utilizing evidence-based practices for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIf you have concerns about the portrayal or understanding of psychological disorders, I encourage you to engage in open dialogue with healthcare professionals and seek information from reputable sources to ensure accurate and compassionate perspectives are shared.\"\n\n.\n\n So, from what I've seen it tells me that ChatGPT is going to be more reliable than googling your symptoms, using WebMD symptom checker, or anything else, and honestly it probably will help you be more successful at determining whether or not you actually need to go to the doctor. And will take into account your symptoms on an equal level. It is probably going to be better at determining comorbid conditions.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nShare with me. Tell me your experiences like this, at ANY time where you felt that someone ignored you, disrespected your body, didn't listen to you when it was important, told you to \"just suck it up\" when you shouldn't. Share with me any time a doctor didn't listen to you or ignored your symptoms. Share with me any time ANYONE discounted how you felt, what you believed, the way you dress/dress/who you are/ANYTHING. If not, share with me what you think, what you have to say. I want to know what everyone has to say.\n\nThis problem of the medical field not listening to women has GOT TO STOP. \n\nTLDR: This misinformation that dates back to 1900BC, which labels \"Hysteria\" to be pain in a major organ system (like the uterus/ovaries) and brain fog (symptom of period pains/PMDD/ADHD/epilepsy/etc. the list goes on) is the head contributor to this social ideology that we live in today, which is present in the workplace, day to day life, in relationships, the medical field, and so much more.",

    "text": "Unnecessary Pelvic Exams on Unconscious Women by Medical Students I've heard about a controversial practice where medical students line up at the bed of a woman under anesthesia at the hospital and take turns practicing pelvic exams on her without her verbal consent. I never thought that much about the practice until I found this language (see screen shot) in a pelvic exam consent form my doctor is having me sign before coming into his office to discuss birth control. I'm livid and might be giving his office a piece of my mind tomorrow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: My appointment was yesterday. I didn't sign the consent form electronically before coming to the appointment and was prepared to fight the office staff on that. Since I was just coming in to discuss IUDs and not be examined, they didn't care that I didn't sign it. I talked to my doctor about the paragraph in the consent form that I don't like and he was very passionate about the subject. He told me that although teaching is important, verbal consent before the procedure, and being introduced to the medical students should be law. I was happily surprised that he seemed as passionate about this issue as me and I he seemed genuine.\n\nHe also told me that there is a consent form without that paragraph but I have to specifically ask for it from his office staff.\n\nI'm still angry, not at my doctor, but at his corporate overlords at my state for allowing this to happen.\n\n[Sneaky paragraph in consent form.](https://preview.redd.it/pqpazewwtg8b1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b0820d6ff1acfd96c6071bd7df73974914fe5ac)",

    "text": "Some space for healthcare related frustrations Hey all.\n\nI am just wondering if anyone else has got some pent up frustration/overwhelm/despair/etc. that you would like to let out of your system by feeling less alone. I am so exhausted by my experience of watching my body struggle and the lack of quality healthcare support for women I have experienced. \n\nSome things I am exhausted by that happened to me this year:\n\n- crying in the parking lot of 4 gyno doctors offices after asking them to sterilize me and being told no. (I burned the 9 IUD pamphlets I got the day I finally got sterilized woo hoo).\n\n- Not being prepared for a traumatic post op recovery or the withdraw and slow recovery from hormonal birth control (I have never felt weaker and less mentally stable in my life and just had to act \"normal\"). \n\n- Having a UTI for 4 months because I was not treated properly and had to jump through the hoops of three different insurance companies. (Shout of to my thousands of dollars in medical debt and taking way too much AZO).\n\n- developing IC and an inability to digest food after 4 antibiotics (being told that you are just probably lactose intolerant when you cant even digest rice). If you have IC, stay away from coffee for the love of goodness. \n\nAll of these happened alongside other daily battles like having periods, COVID, and the daily stress of just trying to keep a job and be a woman in freaking general... \n\nIve been told to smile 3 times while wondering the medication isle looking for pain relief wondering how im gonna keep going.\n\nIve complained a thousand times to my partner (M) but honestly I just want to feel seen and lack women friends in my life who truly get it. \n\nI just want to say that if you feel exhausted by the healthcare system, your own bodies struggling,\nAnd the fact that woman are punished for handling pain well (and not seeming sick enough) and for not handling it well (showing emotion or needing help) - YOU ARENT ALONE. \n\nTLDR: I feel like there is power in knowing you are not the only one suffering from poor health so... give me your rants, give me your thoughts and anger, I would love to hear you out and be of help. \n\nThanks🫡",

    "text": "When Human Life Begins: A Mother’s Day Manifesto (I was thinking about how nonsensical and arbitrary all the different arguments about when life begins are. And how they can pit women grieving miscarriages against women seeking abortions with no regrets. So I wrote this. I use the term “women” throughout rather than “people who give birth.” I have mixed feelings about this. It is specifically women whose role in childbirth has been denigrated throughout history, but I believe *anyone* who gives birth has the authority I am trying to re-establish.)\n\n tl;dr: Human life begins when we say so.\n\n“When does a human life begin” has been for decades now a question of personal philosophy and religious morality. Certainly the fact that there is no historical, theological, or biological consensus on the question has led to heated debate, but until recently we had the luxury of holding our opinions as lightly as we liked. Thanks to the Dobbs decision, however, the political and legal aspects of the question have renewed urgency, and women can no longer afford to allow our views to remain unexamined and unspoken. We must craft a logical argument to defend what many of us know tacitly as a bodily experience, but have never sought to put into words. We must speak about it now and explain to men, so many of whom think it is possible for them to know better than us when life begins, that they are mistaken. For while this may be a moral and philosophical question at its root, the law works with defined categories. Those of us who have given birth have created humans, now we must define them.\n\nThere are many theories about when life begins: fertilisation, implantation, the “quickening,” the detection of a heartbeat, one kind of brainwave or another, and even the biblical “breath of life.” With the possible exception of the quickening, all of these answers share in common two ideas — that human life is the result of some physical or biological process, and that it happens in a single, defined moment in time. \n\nIdentifying a single moment may seen reductive, given how gradually a fetus develops. One might argue that the personhood of a fetus progresses in slow stages as well. This is not very practical for legal and moral judgements however, since it puts us in just as uncertain a position, having to decide when a fetus is human enough that abortion becomes impermissible. So let us concede that we must identify a moment of delineation.\n\nIt’s the other underlying assumption (that this single event of becoming human happens in the course of its physical development),  that bears reconsideration here. For one thing, it seems difficult to reconcile with most common christian understandings of the body and soul. If the essence of a human life is the soul (or spirit), why would that life be defined by a physical milestone? More generally though, unless you take a radical materialist view of personhood, it seems clear that it is not a physical question to ask when a piece of flesh becomes a human. It is a moral, philosophical, or spiritual question; it is a metaphysical question.\n\nHumans are fundamentally, even essentially social. People in prolonged solitary confinement experience what psychologists call derealisation and depersonalisation. They “lose their minds,” as well as the capacity to control their bodies, or even to distinguish their bodies from their surroundings. Later in her life Helen Keller referred to herself in the time before Anne Sullivan taught her language as “Phantom.” She could recall no emotions from that time. When talking about the time when she was learning to finger spell she used the third person, “Helen.” Only after a couple of years of having used language did she begin narrating herself as  “I.” In all the accounts of “feral children,” they are described as more animal than human. And babies who are left untouched die. They simply cease to develop and never reach that potential that children represent. \n\nA human, then, is not defined by individual anatomy. They are defined by their relationship to other humans. Humans develop consciousness through relationships with other humans. And the first, primal and primary relationship any human has is with its mother in the womb. In other words, a human life begins when the mother welcomes her child into a relationship with her, and by extension, into humanity. When a pregnant woman declares, internally or aloud, that she is carrying her child, that is when it becomes her child, and that is when it becomes human.\n\nOur society has all but forgotten this fundamental authority that women have on the topic of the creation of human life. We call it child*bearing*, as if it’s a burden that is placed on us and we are passive recipients of it. We say doctors “deliver” our babies, as if they are packages we have been awaiting rather than humans we have grown within our bodies. Making a human life is a creative process, not just a thing that happens to women, but a thing that they do. Most mothers remember a moment when they discovered or decided that the being inside of them was a person. Some experience this as a revelation and some as a choice, but in both cases their role is an active engagement. They make contact with the child inside of them, and it is this contact, and the nurturing that follows it, that make a human life. The answer to the question then, is very simple. If you want to know when a human life begins, ask your mother.",

    "text": "Helene Wecker's books: are both miserable gender-role disasters? (Spoilers for The Golem and the Jinni) This whole post is going to be spoilers for the first book.  TLDR: loved the intro but hated the sexist ending, is that redeemed in the 2nd book?\n\nI just read Helene Wecker's first book, *The Golem and the Jinni*.  The first 4/5 was a fun romp of two different supernatural beings exploring their new lives.  I love slice-of-life epics, especially when they're leavened by something extraordinary.\n\nThe book's conclusion explains that entire premise is centered around a feckless male Jinni.  He's basically a fuckboy, arrogant and mean as a wasp.  He plays with poor tribespeople, seduces women, destroys their lives, starts the book's entire circumstance waterfall, pisses everyone off, endangers a bunch of people, hurts a lot of folks in unforgivable ways, never learns empathy or kindness or sympathy or love, then when he tries to suicide everyone drops what they're doing to save him for no reason I can find.  His personality is somewhere between insufferable ass and outrageously destructive fuckboy.\n\nThat's it.  That's the book's premise.  It's centered around an irredeemable man and his penis.  The golem in the title is basically Wonder Woman: bright, kind, thoughtful, strong, indefatigable, indestructible, self-sufficient, reads minds, speaks all languages, can learn anything, etc etc etc.  Probably could be a polymath, detective, diplomat, scientist, doctor, therapist, explorer, or anything else she put her mind to.  However at the end of the book, she chooses to live an extremely constricted life as a (swearword) baker's helper, re-bound to serve a man and his emotional needs.  What a waste.\n\nSo: two supernatural beings who could be and do anything, choose to be Fratboy and Ignorable Woman, exactly to their worst expected gender roles.\n\nIs the 2nd book, The Hidden Palace, worth reading or is it more of this sexist garbage?",
