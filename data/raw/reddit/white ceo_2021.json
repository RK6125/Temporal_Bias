    "text": "10 months of unemployment: My experience + advice My streak of being unemployed officially ended last week. Hallelujah!\n\n\\[I've also posted this elsewhere here on Reddit\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is some advice and a few steps I took during my 10 months of unemployment:\n\n**Quick personal facts to be factored in with my experience and suggestions**:\n\n* 24-28, F, Non-White, Southeastern USA\n* Solely seeking for remote positions\n* Unemployed due to teaching contract ending in mid-2020\n* Not eligible for unemployment benefits\n* Master's Degree (social science-related; 2020), Bachelor's Degree (social science-related; 201X)\n* Experience in teaching, research, data analysis, cartography, GIS\n* No kids\n* Unmarried\n* Moved back in with parents\n* No car\n* No debt or student loans\n\n**Quick personal job seeking facts:**\n\n1. INCOME: I moved back home with a savings and lived off this savings for 5 months without job seeking.\n   1. During my unemployment, I lived on my savings July 2020-mid January 2021 and then from February 2021 to May 2021, I lived on the stimulus checks, tax refund, and government grocery aid.\n   2. With this money, I have paid for water and electricity bills as rent and covered my own groceries.\n2. UNEMPLOYMENT: I did not qualify for unemployment benefits, as I had a contract position.\n3. JOB SEEKING: I did not look for jobs until December 2020/January 2021\n   1. Mainly delayed the job seek to take a break and because I had a perception that the job search would be quick and easy. HA.\n4. REFERENCES: I did NOT want to ask my previous job for references. My previous job [really put me through it](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/nt8hve/this_week_marks_the_end_of_10_months_of/), so I did not want to be in their 'debt' for helping me get employment. My current summer job was found without references/networking/etc. I uploaded a resume, cover letter, portfolio, and then got called in for my interviews.\n   1. I think my credit score played a role in them not pursuing any references. My credit score is in the upper 700s and I was reading that some employers can request a credit report. They may have just stopped after reviewing my resume/cover letter and credit report. I'm 110% okay with that. Just a reminder to keep your credit in check. If you don't have credit, I wouldn't get a credit card or in debt just to get a score. Credit cards honestly feels like a scam. My credit score was the lowest when I used them. I don't use them now and it went up by 10+ points. I know, I don't know either.\n5. APPLYING: I have applied to 63 jobs, as of today. All jobs were found on Indeed and applied on either the company's site or Indeed's application system.\n6. SPEC WORK: I have done spec work three and did not get the job for any of them. I do not recommend doing spec work ever.\n7. PHONE AND EMAIL: I created an email address specifically for job seeking and bought a flip phone for prospective job calls. I got a cheap phone from a no-contract provider and got a calling card good for a year that offered 1200 minutes, 1200 text, and 2 gb of data. The phone, warranty, and service totaled roughly $140 USD. Doing this, though, has saved me from having my data stolen on some really data scamming job postings. The data ran up quick even with no apps, so I hopped on wifi and everything was good. I use the new phone number for all job apps so I don't get as many scam calls on my regular cell phone.\n   1. PRO-TIP: Job Postings that use Bamboohr do not protect data. I submitted an app through them, and maybe 2 minutes I get a text asking if I was (insert first and last name).\n   2. Now, that I think of it, any job posting that requires an account and requires full address...do not proceed (or proceed with caution, whichever one you feel comfortable with). They are getting data.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n1. GET ON FOOD STAMPS.\n   1. If you're unemployed, your income is $0. You'll be approved and most likely will receive the maximum amount for a 1 person household. With the pandemic, most states are offering additional support on top of the allotted SNAP benefits.\n2. LOOK FOR GOVERNMENT AID BEFORE GETTING IN DEBT.\n   1. Debt is a burden, plain and simple. Before getting a loan or borrowing money, see if your local/state/federal government has aid. Most local/state/federal governments have assistance for rent, groceries, utilities, and transportation cost. Check with them first. Interest can and will eat you up, usually being unemployed.\n3. START A JOB INTEREST-RELATED BUSINESS OR BLOG.\n   1. To fill in the prospective gap in my resume, I started a business two months after I graduated that was semi-related to my field of study and offered new opportunities to learn about a different field.\n   2. This business earned $0 revenue, but I handled the web design, promotional designs and social media efforts. This is what I put on my resume, not \"owner\". I fully intended to make money off the business, but that was not how it worked out.\n   3. Start up costs were about $500 USD. If I had to do it all over again, I would have just bought the business license (\\~20 USD) and a website yearly subscription (\\~100 USD) and then would have wanted for orders. Business licenses usually last one year, so while you look for another job, having that 'xx/xx/xx-present' on your resume may help your chances.\n   4. Do NOT say you are the owner/founder/ceo on your resume, just say what you do for the business. That is more important. You might get held to a different standard if you say owner/founder/ceo, especially if you have no revenue.\n4. EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN APPLYING TO REMOTE DATA ENTRY JOBS.\n   1. I don't know everyone's else experience, but the remote data entry jobs that I've applied to (found on Indeed and Aerotek) have turned out to be scams or so oversaturated with 500+ applicants.\n   2. I would just avoid job postings with this title or type of job posting\n5. STAY VIGILANT OF SCAMS.\n   1. In a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unemployed/comments/lylbxx/we_are_unemployed_not_desperate_stay_vigilant_of/), I talked about not being desperate with job seeking. THIS IS IMPORTANT. Employers (and scammers) can smell that! Job postings with clear grammatical errors, generic names, no names, requests to go on WhatsApp, Kik...DON'T DO IT.\n   2. If it feels scammy or sketchy, trust that feeling. Walk away. There is something better for you, you have to believe that.\n6. APPLY TO RELATED BUT OUTSIDE FIELD JOBS.\n   1. I got more bites from jobs that were semi-related to my field than jobs in my own field. I was and am shocked. People in your field may hold you to unrealistic expectations while people outside of your field can recognize and appreciate your skillset. You can do \\[TASK\\] without having \\[TASK\\] in your job title.\n   2. I applied to so many jobs that I fit the bill of. Job postings where I checked off 90-100% of the job qualifications and preferences...I did not get.\n   3. The only jobs that I received offers for where 500% out of my league. I MAY BE checked off 45-50% of the job posting. I applied kind of just to see what would happen for the out-of-my-league jobs, but I secretly just 'knew' and felt I would get the jobs that were in my field. NOPE. Each of my job call-backs have been for jobs outside of my field.\n7. NETWORKING IS NOT (ALWAYS) NECESSARY.\n   1. As a fellow redditor mentioned to me, some fields require networking. The tips below are coming from someone that is in data/research/writing fields. Please cherry pick what advice you can use.\n      1. Network works, don't get me wrong, but if it is not in your personality, it can feel a bit weird to do. From my experience, having a solid portfolio was a major factor. I tried [Behance](https://behance.net/) but my student subscription ended after I graduated, so I went with [Google Sites](https://applieddigitalskills.withgoogle.com/c/middle-and-high-school/en/build-a-portfolio-with-google-sites/overview.html) (link goes to Google's tutorial on how to build a portfolio. I do not recommend adding your photo to the first page). They're free and you can build a decent site. Show what you can do!\n      2. Figure out 3-5 different fields that you could apply to based on your skills/education/training. If the job is not really in your field, but you have a good resume of experience and portfolio, they may call you up for an interview just for your sheer audacity of applying. Use that interview opportunity to say you looking to contribute your skills while learning more about \\[new field\\]. If they ask for your biggest weakness, say that you are still learning about \\[something in new field/in job description\\] but are a quick learner.\n8. SAMPLE JOB FIELDS THAT DON'T REQUIRE REFERENCES.\n   1. Check out [r/WorkOnline](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/) for opportunities to get work. Here's a few that I found along the way:\n      1. Online ESL Teaching\n      2. Closed Captioning\n      3. Transcription\n      4. Web Search Evaluation\n      5. Data analyst (some)\n      6. Research (some)\n      7. Internships/Fellowships for upperclassmen and recent grads (some)\n9. RECONSIDER JOBS THAT ASK FOR REFERENCES UP FRONT\n   1. Be wary if potential employers ask for references without even giving you an interview. It sends the signal that they only care about who you know and how that helps their business.\n   2. I had a few jobs that asked for references up front, and I simply withdraw my candidacy. The potential employers seemed like they wanted future clients for their business rather than to ask their questions about my character, and I was not going to risk what relationships I did have to be messed up by an employer hounding them for a sale or future spam email.\n10. LEARN NEW SKILLS FOR FREE.\n\n* [Lynda.com](https://Lynda.com) (now LinkedIn Learning) may be offered for free by your university or local library. Check with them to see if they have subscriptions and start learning. Improve your current skill set or develop a new one in the field you wish to seek a job.\n* [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) has certification programs related to web coding. The certs may not hold weight, but projects will. Build a portfolio of projects you feel comfortable sharing. Who needs a cert if you've proven your skillset repeatedly with awesome designs and projects?\n* [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog) has free courses on web programming languages and web design.\n* [Grow.Google](https://Grow.Google) has free business-related workshops.\n* [Google for Education](https://edu.google.com/) has tools for coding and teaching resources for educators (or anyone who wants to take the training).\n* [Sharpen Design](https://sharpen.design/) is a free resource for generating design prompts that you can later add to your portfolio.\n\n........\\[Formatting gets a bit wonky from here down\\].........\n\n11. CHECK WITH YOUR STATE FOR CAREER CHANGE GRANTS/SCHOLARSHIPS TO TRADE/TECH SCHOOLS\n\n* My state offers career change grants for people without a bachelor's degree (any age) or for specifically people 24/5 years old and older.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n12. KEEP A GOOGLE DRIVE OF YOUR RESUMES/COVER LETTERS, CATEGORIZED BY JOB TYPE/FIELD\n\n* Keep templates by job category so you can quickly alter your resumes and cover letters--checking for date, company name, job title, and a few job posting keywords. I started doing this, and it saved so much time to look at all my resumes and cover letters for data or research jobs and just have to change a few things.\n* I used the [u/sheetsandgiggles](https://www.reddit.com/u/sheetsandgiggles/) [resume template](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/) and customized it a bit. I opted for sans serif and removed the interests & skills section and added a summary section at the top. My resume order is SUMMARY, EXPERIENCE, (sometimes PROJECTS), EDUCATION.\n* Writing cover letters can be a daunting task. I have wrote them and not gotten the job, but I can say that for the job offers that I have had, I included a cover letter. It doesn't hurt to include it. State your interest, your experience, and what you can contribute.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n13. DO NOT STOP AT REJECTIONS.\n\n* My current employer rejected me at first. They went with another candidate and it didn't work out. They called me back about two weeks later offering me the job. At first I was a little salty about being second best (pride is a funny thing), but I accepted gratefully.\n* One time, I received three rejections in one day...within an hour of each other. That was kind of rough.\n* Indeed lets you know that an employer viewed your application. I used to get excited about this, but nothing ever came out of it, for me at least. Sometimes, Indeed sends you a message that they viewed your application, but come to find out, they actually rejected your application shortly after, but you don't get a notification for that. Moral of the story, try not to harp on rejections and keep moving forward with applying to other jobs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In short**\n\nYou can do this. Colleges say that X degree can get you Y job, but that is not true. If a college graduates 100 people for a field that has 2 local jobs, what will be the outcome? Competition, back-biting...yeah, no thanks. Look for jobs outside but related to your field. Jobs in your field want unicorns, jobs outside/related to your field respect your skillset.\n\nIf you're unemployed or job seeking, just know this is for a season. My season of unemployment taught me a lot about myself, about the job application process, about people and tested my faith. Take your season of unemployment or job seeking to learn as well. I wish you all well in your job seek and hope you all find jobs that check off all your boxes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tl;dr:** Know your worth and don't be desperate. Search and apply for government aid before going in debt with loans or credit cards. Fill your employment gap with a business or blog you can create. Build a portfolio for your projects. Learn new skills for free. Go back to school with state grants/scholarships for career changes. Stay strong and keep the faith!",

I’m noticing a pattern that a lot of these guys, (most of them are white men that either had prestigious jobs or had connections,) seem to have delusions of grandeur.\n\nI just turned down an offer for one, the hiring manager was a very sweet woman but the offer was 25% less than what I was making in my last job. The CEO then sent an email saying that I was the first person to reject them and that apparently they’re going to be a $10 billion company one day. Oh, and also they’re apparently a $100 million company now but even though they can’t afford to pay me what I’m worth now, that could change in a year.\n\nIs it even worth responding to such a load of steaming bull crap?",

    "text": "Avoid common pitfalls of job seekers - some step-by-step advice for those looking for something new I've seen a lot of posts here by people who, in my opinion, are not looking for new opportunities efficiently or effectively. Some of the most popular posts are \"I sent out 100+ resumes and finally got an offer!\". First, that sounds like the job search was horrible. Secondly, that means that you're getting rejected before you even really have a chance to make an impression.\n\nI've conducted dozens of interviews and designed both challenges and best practices around good interview questions and best responses. My fiancee is a former LinkedIn employee who now advises dozens of CEOs and Chief HR Officers (CHROs) on their talent strategy and brand. At the very least, we've thought about the practice of hiring more than most.\n\nA lot of the resumes and interview stories posted on this subreddit would not meet our criteria to move forward, but most of the issues are very fixable.\n\n# Pre-resume screen: make yourself stand out\n\nA couple of quick statistics:\n\n* A huge percentages of job candidates are sourced from LinkedIn these days (75%+ in tech)\n* Employee referrals account for the highest probability of landing in role (and tend to be the highest quality candidates)\n* It's 99% stupid to take a job you're going to hate (Investment Bankers, I'm looking at you to fill in that other 1%)\n\nPut all of these to work.\n\n**Outreach**\n\nYou should be talking to people at a company before applying!!! This is one of the two best uses of LinkedIn. Find a company, find someone near your level, find something in common and reach out on LinkedIn\n\n* Connect with a short, personal message saying that their company caught your attention and you wanted to get a sense of what it's like to work there\n* Your goal is to get a sense of what the company, hours, culture, team members, etc are like. You are screening them (but nicely). Don't ignore red flags\n* At the end, ask them if they'd be willing to introduce you to a recruiter or hiring manager via email, then send your email to them over LinkedIn\n\nYou're doing this both to learn about what you'd be getting into, and to separate yourself from potentially hundreds of other candidates. If introduced, your resume WILL be looked at - after all, it came from an introduction within the company. Get yourself to the top of the pile.\n\n**Inbound**\n\nSome LinkedIn tactics that you can use to make recruiters reach out to you more (manipulating the algorithm).\n\n* Always have your profile receptive to inbound requests. Even if you're happy, if something amazing comes along, why not take a look.\n* Changing your profile bumps your profile rank. Particularly your title. Even if you have the same position, modifying the words of your title can be used to increase inbound. Adding or modifying bullets, or just making improvements will also increase your profile score.\n* If you want recruiters to notice you, respond to them, even (especially?) if the answer is no. \"This isn't a good fit right now, but I'd be interested if you know of any \\[Senior XYZ\\] opportunities\"\n\nYou can quickly go from zero recruiter inbound to 20+ per week by playing games with the algorithm. If you do both of these correctly, you should need to be sending out only a couple of resumes before getting an interview (get your resume in good order though).\n\n# Resumes\n\nI won't cover information that's not covered [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/). Basically, use that template (or something close to it) and follow the advice (e.g. interests - that post is correct, interests are a great way to spark a natural conversation).\n\nMy additional advice here:\n\n* One of the frequent reasons I would skip a resume was too many skills listed. This was mostly from experience. If I got someone on the phone for a screen and asked about the 11th skill they listed it was always answer like \"well, one time I wrote a few lines of code in Ruby\". You should have experience with the skills you list, and you should tailor that list to the job you're applying to.\n* Nearly every bullet point under experience should have not just what you did, but what you accomplished. Increased throughput, increased sales, decreased waiting times, improved a process, etc. If you can attach a number, all the better.\n\n|Instead of this|Put this|\n|:-|:-|\n|Greeter at Walmart|Greeter at Walmart. First point of contact for over 120,000 customers|\n|Database schema design|Architected SQL database schema; reduced standard query times by 74%|\n|Designed XYZ ad campaign|Re-architected XYZ ad campaign leading to 51% increase in clickthrough rate|\n\n* Skills should be skills, not personality traits. Hard working isn't a skill. Arc welding is a skill, Javascript is a skill.\n\nBefore interviews, if companies are playing the salary negotiation game \"U say what u want first, no u, no u\" the easiest way around is this:\n\n\"The other companies that I'm actively engaged with are offer this range \\[high number - very high number\\]. I'm confident I can get a competitive offer from them, but I would like to understand your range as well\"\n\n# Interviews\n\nYou are presenting the person that they want to hire, not being brutally honest in the interview phase. This does not mean lie, this means keep things to yourself that are not appropriate. You wouldn't call your interviewer fat, don't say that you're unmotivated (and if you are, work on yourself - thats your issue). Companies are looking for someone who will add value - be a good fit.\n\n**You should have 5+ stories prepared that make you look hard working, motivated, smart, creative, etc. at hand coming into any interview. Depending on the question, there should be one at your disposal.**\n\nA few common questions and some of the \"best answers\"\n\n* \"*Why do you want to work here?*\" If you've been resume spamming and don't know anything about the job, that's mostly on you. Mentioning salary or hours are also not a good answers. If there's something unique about the product or culture, if you've talked to a bunch of people and like all of them, if there's something hard that will give you an opportunity to grow, mention that.\n* \"*Why are you leaving your current role?*\" The worst answer here is that your work/boss is horrible - from the interviewer's perspective, you're just likely to hate this job as well and leave. If there's one white-lie to tell in an interview it's that you really enjoy the company you're at, but you \"want an opportunity to grow\". Say something positive about your current employment experience.\n* \"*Describe a time when you've had a conflict with another employee?*\" or \"*Describe a time when you received constructive criticism*\" or \"*What is job / task you did that you would have done differently?*\" All of these questions are looking not for the conflict, but for the growth after. Answers like \"Someone got jealous because of how hard I was working\" or \"I tend to take on too much responsibility\" are BS, even if true. \"It's become clear to me that in complex systems, upfront testing will save a lot of time down the road\" or \"I spent a lot of time trying to understand the other person's perspective and work with them\". Again, **have examples ready for these** if you want to really crush your interview.\n* \"*What accomplishment (from your resume) are you most proud of?*\" - This is my favorite question to ask. We're going to take a deep dive, so you'd better have done the work. It doesn't have to be your favorite, however, it should show you in the best light. The best answers are some combination of (1) impactful work (bonus points if you can measure impact) (2) self-suggested (shows motivation) (3) collaborative (4) actual contribution. It's ok if you didn't do parts of the work, but it's not if you try to claim credit for something you clearly know very little about.\n\nFor every single interview you do, unless it's impossible, send a thank you note. It should be 3-5 sentences (really short). \"It was a pleasure to meet you\" \"Thank you for taking the time to speak with me\" \"The people / process / company has been great throughout this process\" \"I look forward to hearing next steps\" etc. You don't need to rehash any question or clarify anything - they were there with you.\n\n# Offer / Negotiation\n\nMost candidates do not negotiate, or even attempt to. You should, except in very rare circumstances. Correctly asking for more will almost never lead to a retraction and similarly will almost never lead to ill will later on. In either case, you probably dodged a bullet.\n\n* A couple of ways to approach:  (1) The other places you're looking offer something better (2) the industry typically pays better for the same experience.\n* First and foremost, you WANT to be working there \"I think your company is a great fit from a skills and culture match\". Again though, it's \"I'm also in active discussions with other companies - you're offering $14/hr and they're offering $18/hr. Given the discrepancy and that the fit is so good, is there any flexibility on salary?\". Here, active discussions could mean \"I sent a resume to them a month ago and nothing has happened\" - you're certainly pursuing the opportunity!\n* The second is \"The industry pays \\[e.g. $70,000 to $90,000\\] for this position and given my experience and skillset of XYZ I think it would be justified to earn the top half of that range.\" They've picked you because you're qualified - it's unlikely that they're just randomly choosing poor quality candidates!\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nDon't stay at a job you hate. Start asking around for alternatives, feel out the culture and make the move. It'll likely end you with a better salary and better mental state. If you're a student, you'll get a huge hit rate on asking for informational interviews from people that went to your school (or otherwise!). Don't be afraid to reach out.",

    "text": "Accept a Counter Offer from my Employer? Throwaway account. Sorry this is long, I'm trying to give enough context. If it's important I am a nearing-40y white woman.\n\nToday, I work for a small, \\~25 person, development house that has  been around for 10 years. I am a department head, in charge of 1/3 of  the project of our primary client. (they constitute roughly 40% of the  income for our company) \n\nI have been in this role for 1.5 years and have, by all measures,  been a rousing success. My reviews are glowing, my direct reports are  happy, the client is happy. Further more, I am happy. The job is easy  for me, and I make more money than I would have ever thought possible 5  years ago.\n\nI started in March 2020. I got 1.5 weeks in the office before we went  on lockdown. Thankfully the company was able to weather the pandemic  without any layoffs.\n\nThe plan is for my company to return to the office 100% after Labor  day. I, however, have never been happier than I have been working from  home. **I have been off antidepressants for the first time in my adult life.** Turns out whatever demands are needed of us to be in an office for 40 hours a week is horrible on my mental health.\n\nSo, I went job hunting. I was even willing to take a pay cut to stay remote. I landed two offers.\n\n**Offer #1:** Completely different kind of company  (They've been around for 100+ years) in a completely different industry  that is publicly traded. The same industry I wanted to be in when I was  growing up. Offering a 4% raise from my current job. Benefits are good,  but not as good as the current job. Job is very similar to my current  responsibilities.\n\n**Offer #2:** Privately held company that's also been  around for 100+ years. The industry doesn't excite me and I feel as  ambivalent about it as my current industry. Offering 9.8% raise with  fantastic benefits, on par with my current job. Also offering a insane  end of year bonus and 401k matching that my current employer does not.  This is a brand new role for a brand new team that will oversee the  entire technical side. I get to build it to what I want it to be. These  guys were excited about me from the start. Rushed me through the  interview process knowing that I had other prospects. I don't know if I  can do this job. (that might be imposter syndrome talking)\n\nStill deciding between Offer #1 and #2, I reach out to our COO, who  is my boss, and tell her that I am resigning. She took it exceptionally  well. I was glad she didn't try to provide a counteroffer.\n\nExcept she did, when she called me back 30 minutes later. She asked me what they could do to keep me.\n\nI did anticipate this, and said that I was worried if I stayed remote  when no one else did that it would breed resentment. Why do I get to  work from home when no body else does? Doesn't seem like a healthy work  environment to me. She told me that she was talking with the CEO and  they're worried I might be the canary. She knows several folks want to  have hybrid schedules, and I am probably not the only person who wants  to to stay fully remote.\n\nShe also repeated the same stuff I said above. I believe her when she  says that I'm an asset, that my team works well together and that's  hard to find, and that replacing me would be difficult.\n\nBut everything I've ever read on the internet tells me you **never** accept a counter offer. That they'll just kick me to the curb the next  time the budget needs to be cut. Those never seem to have much context  though. If I were just a desk jockey and not in charge of so much of the  business.. but it is a risk.\n\nI can probably wangle a 4% raise, but not the near 10% raise, if I  stayed. However, I am not really motivated by money. Especially not in  this case. If I was, Offer #2 is too amazing to pass up.. but I think I  was always leaning to accept Offer #1.\n\nI'm not asking you what to do, really. In the end, it's my decision. I  would love to hear outside thoughts from others, though. Give me  perspectives I can't see or haven't thought of.\n\nThere is a small chance I might fail the drug test that Offer #2  requires. Recreational cannabis is legal in my state and I use it very  casually when I'm having trouble sleeping. When I asked the talent  acquisition specialist if it was going to be a concern, she said they  follow national guidelines but she doesn't know much more than that.",

I'm not sure how it is for other countries, but going through the recruitment processes of any kind of company that has an office in Bucharest is one of the funniest things ever. Of course, it's not \"haha\" funny, it's more like giving yourself a nudge in the head at how laughably predictable HR and hiring managers are.\n\nFirst off, any job that has \"x\" positions available has a huge luck factor included in it. Since there is a surplus of candidates literally everywhere, you can be rejected for anything, literally anything.\n\nNot smiling enough, smiling too much, not smiling with your eyes, having a buzz cut, having too much hair, not having your hair tied up, having your hair tied up, not shaving, being too eager, not being eager enough, interrupting the interviewer once, asking too many questions not asking any questions, daring to even ask a question, trying to negotiate your pay, not trying to negotiate your pay, not being a student, not being a recent graduate, not knowing  the company's core values, not following the company on linkedin, having tattoos, not having pets, having pets, living with your parents, having noisy children or roommates, living in a rural area, living in a ghetto, being unemployed for more than 2 months, BEING EMPLOYED (lol i swear to god), scoring less than 70/100 on logic tests, scoring less than 80/100 on logic tests (yes, I have gotten both reasons), being white, being black, being male, being female, being a foreigner, being a fucking native, not knowing english, KNOWING TOO MUCH ENGLISH, going through a divorce, going through a family funeral, saying \"hello\" instead of \"good morning/afternoon/evening\", being too skinny, being too fat, having pimples, wearing too much makeup, wearing no makeup at all, not knowing how to apply makeup, wearing makeup as a male, not being in an enclosed space when you have an interview (zoom), being too quiet, being too loud, nodding too much, saying \"mhm\" too many times (have you ever heard of active listening, man?), not saying enough about yourself, saying too much about yourself, not having good teeth, not having trimmed nails, not blurring your background on zoom, blurring your background on zoom, liking to play video games, looking too much like a gym bro, not knowing who the CEO of the company is, liking fast food, not liking fast food, not liking vegan fast food and liking mainstream fast food, not having experience, having too much experience, not having enough experience, not having experience on one of the 8 different tools the job requires you to use, being overqualified (this is having too much experience and also knowing all the tools and processes, i guess), having worked for the company before, not having worked for any company so far, having worked for too many companies so far, having too many colleges under your belt, having only one college under your belt, not having gone to a prestigious college, mumbling too much when you solve a test, CLEARLY EXPLAINING WHAT YOU ARE DOING ON A TEST WHILE YOU ARE SOLVING IT AND APPEARING ARROGANT BECAUSE OF IT, being in more than one hiring processes (you mad because I want more options?), NOT BEING IN MORE THAN ONE HIRING PROCESSES (what the fuck, you drones have literally gone crazy), having beady eyes (lol, i just didn't get enough sleep), not having a signature when you reply to an email, having the audacity to reschedule an interview, having a weird name, having your resume give off a \"weird vibe\" (??????), not putting effort in your resume, putting too much effort in your resume, having worked for a shady company, not putting the shady company you have worked for on your resume, having wet hair (yea i just got out of the shower, excuse me), BEING \"EXPRESSIONLESS\" FOR THE FIRST 5 SECONDS OF THE VIDEO INTERVIEW BECAUSE OF INTERNET LAG, not wearing a tie, not wearing a business shirt, not wearing a normal shirt, not laughing at the interviewer's stupid joke, saying you checked out the reviews of their company (which are obviously bad, but even if you don't say so, they'll realize), NOT CHECKING OUT THE REVIEWS OF THEIR COMPANY (oh, so if you have good reviews, I'm in the wrong??), saying you didn't check out their reviews, but you actually did, you just didn't want the convo to go here; them being a bit disappointed in the fact that you didn't and you backtrack and say you actually did tho but now they think you're not trustworthy (can we just stop with the reviews, hr, please?), not wanting to do a polygraph test, doing a polygraph test and being rejected for the fact that you have friends that smoke weed (whoever came up with this idea for a software developer interview should be have his feet tickled for eternity).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, so I did embellish a few of those. You can kind of guess what, but most of those are accurate representations of what's going through a recruiter's head (or a hiring manager's head) when they're thinking of rejecting you. This isn't something I came up with on my own, these are actual reasons that I've heard from friends that work for the companies I applied to and recruiters that I've talked with (or eavesdropped on).\n\nGood luck on finding that dream job guys.

I was leaning over the table making my points but my scarf ends kept falling onto the chart, I took it off so as not to be a distraction. I was wearing a simple white blouse with the top two buttons undone - hardly risqué. As I was making my presentation, I noticed one of the three men was obviously trying to look down my blouse every time I bent over to point something out. This happened 5 or 6 times. My B+ boobs are hardly distracting, especially dressed as I was. The man who couldn't keep his eyes off them was their head IT guy. About 1/3 of the way through, the CEO interrupted me. He told the IT guy that if he couldn't keep his mind on business, he could leave. I apologised and offered to button up if it was distracting. He said not to bother and apologised to me about his guy's behaviour and the interruption. IT guy left and I continued. I felt SO empowered! The CEO respected both me and my work enough that he was willing to have his man leave so I would not feel uncomfortable. I have never had this happen before. I just had to let my sisters in STEM know times are changing! Keep up the good work. We're getting there.",

    "text": "Pissed off and looking for examples of women/BIPOC owned companies I’m female, millennial, and mixed race, which are all relevant to my story. I recently attended a three-hour marketing seminar as part of a larger business conference event. From the very beginning of the conference, I was shocked to be surrounded by 90% white men, very few women, and even fewer people of color. \n\nThroughout the three-hour seminar, the speaker (white male, in his 40s) showed numerous examples of what he deemed to be successful marketing, including a series of three video commercials back-to-back, each featuring a white, male CEO (or a pair of white, male CEOs), sharing the story of their company. They met in college! They were outsiders to the industry! They took the world of [razors, socks, deodorant] by storm! Immediately after showing these three videos, the presenter said, “When customers can see themselves in your product, that’s when they'll feel a connection with you.” \n\nEvery example in his presentation featured white men as CEOs or in positions of leadership. With each example, it felt increasingly ridiculous. Three hours is a loooong time. The only mention of women was their potential as a customer base, an audience to be marketed to. He spent a cringey amount of time discussing “Millennial Moms,” which he kept referring to as “The Birth of Karen.” Every comment about women and/or millennials was derogatory. No notice that there were actual millennial moms in his audience (leaders in their businesses!) among all the white men present. \n\nAfter the seminar, I went to the front of the room to speak with the presenter. I pointed out the irony of what he said about customers making connections if they can see themselves in a company’s product, when I didn’t see myself represented in any part of his presentation. His response was, “I didn’t choose these companies as examples because they were founded by white men, I chose them because they are great examples of marketing.” I told him to try looking harder. \n\nRedditors, would you please comment with links of amazing women and BIPOC owned companies so I can fill this guy’s inbox with examples for his future presentations? Please and thank you.",

    "text": "Marcus Lemonis rewards teachers and staff at his alma mater This is incredible.\n\nMarcus Lemonis donated to his high school, Miami’s Columbus High School, and also gave each staff member $18,000 each!!\n\nFrom The Miami Herald (link below):\n\nTV star and entrepreneur Marcus Lemonis lacks the white beard and red coat, but after announcing Thursday he will give $18,000 checks to each employee at his alma mater, Christopher Columbus High School, many may start calling him Santa Claus.\n\n“It’s hot as s*** out here. I know we’re not supposed to cuss — all right — I will try to be brief about this,” said Lemonis, 48, as soon as he took the stage in front of about 1,600 people during a 9 a.m. schoolwide meeting on the Columbus football field.\n\nThe school administration had told students, teachers and staff to gather for a special guest appearance but hadn’t revealed the details. The last time they all gathered there was two years ago when the football team won the state championship.\n\n“When we think about the people that make this school run, the people that make it tick, the people that take care of the grounds and the classrooms, that teach us, that take care of us, those to me are the most important service providers on the planet,” Lemonis said. “It’s not a glamorous job; it’s not a high-paying job; it’s a job with a lot of stress.\n\n“Today, I’ll be providing a $3.1 million tip to everybody who works here. You’ll be sharing it,” he said. “Whether you’re a school teacher, whether you are in the maintenance department — every single employee will receive a check for $18,000.”\n\nLemonis, who hosts CNBC’s “The Profit,” graduated from Columbus in 1991 and was inducted into the Columbus Hall of Fame in 2015. In August 2020, the school partly named a new facility, the Center for Science and the Arts, after him.\n\nHis donation comes as part of his new initiative, The Great American Tip Off, a nationwide call to action to tip servers across the country.\n\nLemonis will dole out about $3.1 million to cover the one-time payments to the 180 Columbus employees — about 145 teachers and about 35 support staffers. Cristina Cruz, the school’s marketing director, said she couldn’t disclose the average employee salary at Columbus.\n\nAs soon as Lemonis broke the news, the crowd exploded in cheers.\n\n“What the h*** just happened?” said Jannette Rojas, who teaches English at Columbus, 3000 SW 87th Ave. “Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Is this what kids feel like with Santa? Is this what my kids feel on Christmas morning?”\n\nRojas, 44, has worked at Columbus for about seven years and has two boys, ages 8 and 11. “This the most wow thing that has ever happened,” she said.\n\nErin McGrath, a colleague of Rojas in the school’s English department, described what happened as a “great example” of giving back and following the mission of the school’s Marist Brothers, an international organization of religious men dedicated to education. She has worked at the school for about 13 years.\n\n“If you could’ve taken a picture of my face, it would’ve been a meme,” said McGrath, 36. “My heart is happy. It’s so full. I’m speechless.”\n\nBoth said they would follow Lemonis’ advice and use the money to pay off debt and invest. “Don’t go shopping!” Lemonis had told them a few minutes earlier.\n\nYovani Alvarez, the head of maintenance at the school and an employee of about 14 years, said he wants to invest it for his future.\n\n“I’m very grateful,” said Alvarez, 43. “Very excited.”\n\nSchool will also build two new centers, cancel class Friday\n\nLemonis also announced Thursday he will contribute an additional $7 million to build a college guidance center and a success center for students of disadvantaged backgrounds. Cruz said 35 percent of students at Columbus receive financial aid.\n\nHe requested the guidance center be named after two former teachers of his: Pat Call and Irene Culmo, and the success center after the Desmond family, his former neighbors. They all helped him get to where he is now and he wanted to recognize that.\n\n“Two of the families were school teachers of mine when I went here, and the other family, the Desmond family, is the reason that I came to Columbus. They drove me to school every day. They shepherded me and gave me all of the instructions I needed,” he said.\n\nCall, who taught biology and math at Columbus for nearly 45 years before retiring last spring, said “it was a total surprise” and she was “floored” when Lemonis said he wanted to honor her.\n\nLemonis’ most recent donation of more than $10 million is the largest the private, Catholic, all-male school has ever received since its founding in 1958. Cruz said she couldn’t disclose how much Lemonis has donated on other occasions, but that “he has been a great supporter of the school for many years.”\n\nLemonis was born in 1973 in Beirut, Lebanon. His birth mother dropped him off at an orphanage as a four-day-old baby. His parents, Sophia, a Lebanese, and Leo, a Greek, adopted Lemonis and moved him as a nine-month-old baby to Miami, where they raised him.\n\nAt about 25, after graduating from Marquette University in Wisconsin, Lemonis founded Camping World, which grew from a single store in Bowling Green, Kentucky, to the nation’s largest retailer of RVs, headquartered in Lincolnshire, Illinois.\n\nLemonis still leads the $5 billion-a-year company, which has more than 160 locations across the country, as its CEO and board chairman. \n\nIn “The Profit,” Lemonis finds struggling businesses and offers them cash in exchange for a piece of the profit, then tries to save the venture. In 2022, he will star in another show — The Renovator for HGTV — in which he will help people transform their homes. \n\nBefore he wrapped up Thursday, Lemonis said he had a third announcement that he hadn’t cleared with the administrators, pointing to the school’s president Thomas Kruczek: “There is no school tomorrow!” he said. Kruczek looked at him in surprise and raised his arms.\n\n“Marcus! Marcus! Marcus!” the students chanted. Asked later if he meant it, Lemonis said: “Oh, they’re definitely having school off tomorrow — I’m going to lock the fence, the door.”\n\nCruz confirmed afterward that the school canceled classes for Friday.\n\nRead more at: https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/education/article256436921.html#storylink=cpy",

Turns out it didn’t. I’ve been saving money up and now have a potential job lined up (my GF can get me a job at her company in a different department — I’ve thought about this a lot and don’t see an issue with it) \n\nI just requested two days PTO for 7/12 & 7/13 - my boss said “you’ll be logged in though, right?” \n\nI said not for 7/12 as I’ll be white water river rafting - so literally no way I can take a call. However, for 7/13 I can be available if needed. I’ve worked at this company for 4 years and the expectation anytime I take time off is that I’ll be available if there’s a client emergency (mind you, if I don’t pick up it’s not like someone would die — we do outsourced billing for physicians offices) \n\n Amounts other things — this was my breaking point today. I’m going to quit but also don’t want to burn all my bridges as I know the owner personally (friend of mine who doesn’t have anything to do with day to day business, i report to CEO) \n\nMy question is, do I give months notice after I get back or do I do it on 6/28?",

I am paid $22/hr, my benefits are paid for by my employer (not the hospital, I work for a subcontracted group), and in general, it is a pretty low-stress job and workload. I attribute this to my success as a manager, I adapt people's schedules so that many may go to the local community college for school, I schedule people three months in advance, and I check in regularly and provide whatever time off requests people have. There is also a long-term benefit to the hospital in that many of my staff go on to become ER nurses. \n\nAdditionally, I do some work that is mutually beneficial to the hospital's billing department, and my group's billing department \\[American Healthcare is a business, and I am sorry, but I also need to eat\\].

My daughter was witness to it since she came with me to my job. She’s commented from time to time how the admin doesn’t treat me nice. \n\nBecause the admin was demanding and being rude af, I lose it and storm to my boss’s office and ask why is this admin checking my work, is this an issue with job performance or is this about something else. \n\nThe admin, just like that, becomes syrupy sweet to my boss.

    "text": "Some common gender myths and their rebuttals It seems like the same discussions come up around Reddit a lot, so I figured I'd gather up some common topics, and their rebuttals.\n\nMany of these arguments can be expanded with more points and sources but I'm trying to keep this as compact and to the point as possible.\n\n####Myth 1: \"Sexism against men is never institutional or systematic\"\n\nMany forms of sexism and discrimination against men are *explicitly* institutionalized or systemic in society.\n\nExamples include police violence, court biases, incarceration, child custody discrimination, military service, educational biases, health research and spending, insurance, housing discrimination, reproductive rights, bodily autonomy rights, and many others.\n\nThe widespread ignorance and denialism around these issues can itself be interpreted as a form of systemic discrimination against men as well.\n\nNote that some of these are institutional because they boil down to statutory legal rights which exist in the realm of government policy and administration.  And the government is obviously an institution.\n\n#### Myth 2: \"Most politicians and CEOs are men, and this has led to a society that privileges men and disenfranchises women\"\n\nThe fact that many positions of formal power are occupied by men does not translate into measurable privileges for the average man.\n\nThe assumption this is based on is the idea that men have an in-group bias and prefer other men over women.\n\nWhich is an idea that has been debunked over and over again in the academic literature.  The gender bias among men is almost zero, and sometimes manifests as an out-group bias sightly in favor of women, not other men.\n\nIn-group bisses do exist among women though.  In fact some research has found evidence for very strong gender biases among women.  Including when it comes to educators, bosses, and hiring managers.  Women in formal positions of power do actually seem to prefer other women over men, in much the same way that men are accused of behaving. So maybe this is just projection: people who themselves have gender biases assume that everyone else does as well.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15491274\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103101915112\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_9\n\n####Myth 3: \"Women were uniquely oppressed in history compared to men\"\n\nMuch like today, sexism in history was often two sides of the same coin.  If it was unfair that women had to stay home and take care of their children then it was also unfair that men had to work long hours outside the comfort of their homes.  Many people try to equate sexism to the history of racism, as if men were unilaterally oppressing women for their own benefit. And that's simply not an accurate view of history (nor is it a very healthy belief to have).  \n\nGender norms were often unfair to women. But for most of history, women could own property, get divorced (where they usually took most of their husband's money), run businesses, and even be heads of state.  Many large empires were ran by women, for example.\n\nThe reality of the situation though is that pregnancy (and breastfeeding) often dictated the need for women to have men supporting them. Birth control and baby formula didn't exist. So your options were basically abstinence, or marriage. Which was the same choice that men also had.\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books/about/The_Privileged_Sex.html?id=4szznAEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description\n\nhttps://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download_file?file_format=application/pdf&safe_filename=Item.pdf&type_of_work=Journal%20article\n\nhttps://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199582174.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199582174-e-036\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/legalsubjection00baxgoog/\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/beard/woman-force/index.htm\n\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1855/f217b082603d0ab37ea80c4741fceb8a4a23.pdf\n\n**\"What about voting rights?\"**\n\nVoting rights were historically tied to military service and the draft. It was never something that men got \"for free\" just for being men.\n\nIn England, most men couldn't vote until 1918, and that was only because they instituted a draft for all men during WWI.\n\nWomen aged 30 and older were also given the right to vote in 1918, and this came without the same obligation to serve in the military that men had.  Women over 21 were given voting rights just 10 years later in 1928, which was the same age that men could vote.  And that temporary age difference had a practical purposes: so many men died in WW1 that there was a need to even out the gender ratio.\n\nSo men have been allowed to vote for a whopping 10 years longer than women, *at most*.  And that was only because of the mass, involuntary slaughter that they experienced around the world during WW1.\n\nOther obligations that men had were paying taxes, attending caucuses, and signing up for bucket bridges to fight fires.\n\nIt took a few decades in some parts of the world for people to decide that it was fair for women to be able to vote without giving anything back to the state, but I think it's important to understand the context here. It wasn't misogyny or oppression but political theory.  Specifically the question of whether or not it was fair to give women voting rights without equivalent responsibilities that were required from men (something known as a [moral hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard), and that can be contextualized as *\"female privilege also sometimes harming women\"*).\n\nhttps://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/womenvote/parliamentary-collections/collections-the-vote-and-after/representation-of-the-people-act-1918/\n\nhttp://www.familyofmen.com/when-did-men-and-women-have-the-right-to-vote-in-canada/\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/iu2ebj/women_could_and_did_own_property_and_have_rights/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/l1byes/suffrage_was_primarily_a_class_issue_not_a_gender/\n\n####Myth 4: \"Domestic violence and sexual assault are primarily women's issues\"\n\nDomestic violence and sexual assault affects everyone, and at nearly identical rates between men and women.\n\nIn the US, roughly 37.3% of women have been victims of domestic violence, stalking, sexual harassment, and sexual abuse.  Including 1.4 million women who experience sexual assault annually.\n\nFor men that same figure is 30.9%. Including 1.7 million men who experience sexually assault annually (defined as \"made to penetrate\").  The vast majority of these men are also victimized by women, not by \"other men\" (which is another myth).\n\nThis pattern is similar across the world, including in poor and underdeveloped nations (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/koinom/some_sources_on_the_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys/) for a collection of studies), and is consistent with a wide range of research demonstrating \"gender parity\" between men and women for this topic.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf\n\nhttp://webshare.law.ucla.edu/Faculty/bibs/stemple/Stemple-SexualVictimizationPerpetratedFinal.pdf\n\nhttps://1in6.org\n\nIt's also not true that there's a significant difference in severity between male and female victims.  Around 66% of intimate partner homicides do have women as victims (which is hardly a staggering majority), but when you include intimate partner related suicide deaths (including assisted suicides), a greater number of men are killed because of domestic violence than women.  These statistic also ignore the fact that lesbian relationships are more violent than heterosexual and gay male relationships.  Which inflates these numbers and doesn't necessarily back up the idea that women are being uniquely victimized by men.\n\nWe should obviously work to fight against abuse in any form, but our current, gendered approach to this doesn't seem to be helping very much.  It is also commonly used as an excuse for misandry.  Many people who discuss abuse against women do not actually care about female victims.  All they care about is advancing a culture of hatred and sexism against men.\n\nhttps://web.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm\n\nhttps://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.5042/jacpr.2010.0141/full/html\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01506/full\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/f4rvop/some_sources_on_the_severity_of_domestic_violence/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/koinom/some_sources_on_the_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/f5tes5/gender_parity_for_sexual_assault_academic_studies/\n\n**\"But women are afraid to walk down dark alleyways at night!\"**\n\nAs they should.  And as do men.  Most violent crime targets men. And fear is subjective. This is hardly evidence of some kind of unique oppression against women (at least one that doesn't also affect men), and it ignores the fact that men are usually afraid of finding themselves in those same situations as well.\n\nMen are stronger and more capable of defending themselves so I wouldn't blame someone for having gendered views or assumptions here.  But let's try not to minimize male victimization or blame it on things like \"male oppression\".\n\n####Myth 5: \"False allegations are extremely rare\"\n\nMultiple studies have found alarmingly high rates of false allegations in society.\n\nAs many as 1 in 7 men have been falsely accused at some point in their life, and they often have to live with those allegations even after proving their innocence.\n\nIn addition, around 1 in 20 women have also been falsely accused at some point during their life.\n\nFalse allegations are particularly common when it comes to child custody and divorce, where well over half of all allegations have been estimated to be false.  There is also a common racial element that targets minority men.  Especially in history during the era of lynchings in the US.\n\nhttp://www.saveservices.org/dv/falsely-accused/survey/\n\n http://www.prosecutorintegrity.org/pr/survey-over-20-million-have-been-falsely-accused-of-abuse/\n\nhttps://quillette.com/2019/04/16/divorce-and-the-silver-bullet/\n\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/14977/14977-h/14977-h.htm\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/e6w4yc/i_call_bullshit_on_the_false_rape_accusation/\n\n####Myth 6: \"Men commit suicide more often than women, but women still *attempt* suicide more often than men\"\n\nThis idea has its origins with faulty hospital reporting which lumps suicide attempts in with self-harm (which is something that's more common among women).  Women are also more likely to report their suicide attempts than men. And even if this statistic were accurate, it ignores the obvious fact that a suicide survivor can attempt again, thus artificially inflating this statistic.\n\nThe fact is, most suicid deaths are men, and most evidence points to there being more unique attempts by men. Any evidence that men are \"better\" at it than women has been interpreted as evidence for greater motivation of success, due to the very same factors that lead them to attempt suicide to begin with. Not as evidence that women are somehow attempting suicide at rates similar to men in the background.\n\nhttps://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1398-8\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/cvpyve/comment/ey5xeda\n\n####Myth 7: \"Men make more money because of their gender, and this is evidence of male privilege\"\n\nExisting gender norms encourage men to earn money in order to meet the financial demands that are placed on them by women.\n\nThis causes them to work harder and sacrifice more for their careers than women. Which they do in part because their income is tied to how successful they are with women, and whether or not they qualify as \"marriage material\".\n\nThe wage gap is therefore an example of a gender norm that harms men just as much as it does women.\n\n92% of workplace deaths are men. Men work on average an extra 4 to 10 hours a week (depending on your source) than women. They start working at a younger age (often skirting child labor laws). They retire later (which is also during their peak earning years). And they die sooner than women. Men have worse health outcomes than women and that's largely because of the pressures that society puts on them to be successful and earn money to spend on women.\n\nThis is the other side of the wage gap that is equally as important, and that is equally as harmfully to men as it is to women. And it's really just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIn many ways the wage gap is just a reflection of the financial exploitation of men in society.  Which is facilitated by things like hypergamy and unfair marriage and divorce practices.\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/kzvfcg/about_the_wage_gap/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/dxaimc/the_wage_gap_is_created_by_women_and_reflects/\n\n####Myth 8: \"Men don't go to the doctor because of toxic masculinity\"\n\nThe main reason that men sometimes don't seek help is a lack of time to see a doctor.\n\nMen work longer hours than women at jobs that are less flexible, and more stressful, than jobs that women usually work at. [Men overall engage in an extra hour of paid and unpaid labor per day compared to women](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/ft_18-05-01_fathersday_time/), and an extra 45 minutes commuting to jobs that are further away. Meaning men on average have quite a bit less free time to go see a doctor than women do.\n\nThis is also something that changes during retirement: retired men are just as likely to go to the doctor as retired women.\n\nhttps://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e003320\n\nA general lack of help and support, especially financial support, for men who need medical help also contributes to this.  There is a myth that men are better taken care of than women which has resulted in gendered policies that help women, but exclude men.  Even though it's men who often need that help more.\n\n####Myth 9: \"Men don't speak up about sexism as much as women, so it's obviously not as big of an issue\"\n\nThis is because people are less likely to care or listen to them. In part because many men who do speak up are silenced and accused of being misogynistic. A situation known as testimonial injustice or [epistemic oppression](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-epistemic-oppression/).\n\nMen are told to keep quiet and many end up internalizing the idea that only women can be discriminated against, since this is what society tells us to believe.  Instead, men often adopt different terminology when they discuss gender issues.  Like referring to differences in treatment between men and women as \"double standards\" instead of sexism or discrimination.\n\n####Myth 10: \"Most men's issues are caused by men themselves\"\n\nMost men's issues are caused by gender norms and those gender norms are enforced by women just as much as they are by men.\n\nMen's issues are often just one side of the coin, and usually reflect disadvantages that women face as well.\n\nOne of the biggest gender norms in society is hypergamy, or the tendency for women to try to marry up, and for men to marry down.  And this gender norm is mostly enforced by women, not by men.\n\nTwo other gender norm that are enforced by women is the providership gender norm, and the childcare gender norm. Which also causes women to perform more unpaid work and earn less money than men in the labor market.\n\nA fourth gender norm that is enforced by women more than men is the \"boys don't cry bias\". Which is mainly instilled in young boys by their mothers and by female school teachers.  In fact, fathers and male school teachers actually fight against this gender norm.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053535711000321\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/messages-of-shame-are-organized-around-gender/275322/\n\nhttps://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/09/24/chapter-1-public-views-on-marria\n\nhttps://scholar.harvard.edu/files/akillewald/files/money_work_and_marital_stability.pdf\n\nhttps://www.fatherhood.org/fatherhood/maternal-gatekeeping-why-it-matters-for-children\n\nhttps://news.uoguelph.ca/2019/11/mothers-push-gender-stereotypes-more-than-fathers-study-reveals/\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/gjtj10/most_people_regardless_of_gender_prefer_to_stay/\n\n####Myth 11: \"Toxic masculinity is harming men and their mental health\"\n\nThe concept of toxic masculinity has never been empirically tested, and some research questions the validity of it in the context of psychology and mental health.\n\nEven if you do think it is valid though, it is still commonly used in a way that is sexist and hateful torwards men.\n\nIn recent years it has become associated with female supremacy, feminist hostility towards men, and misandry in general.  And as a result, the vast majority of men find the term to be sexist and offensive.\n\nMen who identify with traditional masculine values have greater self-esteem, better mental health, better relationships with women, and are usually better educated than men who are opposed to masculinity or who accept feminist views about the patriarchy and toxic masculinity.\n\nThe key to better mental health for men might therefore be an embracement of masculinity, not a shunning of it.  Instead of trying to redefine masculinity, we should work to understand it better, and offer men better services based on an honest acknowledgement that men's and women's mental health might require different approaches.\n\nMen are not \"defective women\", and treating men's mental health in that context does not seem to be working very well.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/apa-guidelines-men-boys.html\n\nhttps://zenodo.org/record/3871217#.X-p1ji2l2J_\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_5\n\n####Myth 12: \"Most men's activists just hate women or are opposed to feminism.  They don't really care about men.\"\n\nThis rhetoric is normally used to silence the voices of men (and women) who support men's rights and prevent them from expressing themselves.  Which makes it another example of testimonial injustice or epistemic oppression.\n\nThe fact is that many people do care about men's issues, and that's why they become MRAs.  Feminism does get discussed in the men's movement, but there are a couple reasons for that:\n\n1. Many feminists, \"radical\" or otherwise, have advocated against men and have even pushed for public policy in ways that are harmful to men or discriminates against men. Feminists themselves tend to not fight against this, meaning it's often up to MRAs to address it.\n\n2. Many MRAs are themselves current or ex-feminists who were ostracized for daring to take the feminist rhetoric about *\"also caring about men\"* a little too seriously.\n\nWarren Farrell is a great example of this. He used to be on the board of directors for NOW, the world's largest feminist organization.\n\nAnd then he said that we need to work on child custody equality and reproductive rights for men. Topics that he assumed should fall under the umbrella of feminism since they are issues pertaining to gender equality.  Instead of agreeing with him though, he ended up being excommunicated from the feminist movement. And now he's often regarded as the \"father of the modern men's movement\" for carrying on his advocacy outside of feminism.\n\nThe problem that many MRAs have with feminism is that it usually stops half way when advocating for gender equality.\n\nSo sometimes what MRAs are doing is just taking it the rest of the way towards actual gender equality. Our frustration with feminists comes from the fact that they refuse to see this as valid (or do it themselves to begin with).\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ihmb2p/by_denying_that_the_feminist_establishment_is/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/9v6tqj/a_list_about_feminism_misandry_for_anyone_who/\n\n####Myth 13: \"Men don't receive custody of their children because they're bad fathers and don't bother requesting custody\"\n\nAcademic research simply does not back this up.  [The only study that ever found something like this was discovered to be purposefully fraudulent](http://www.breakingthescience.org/SJC_GBC_analysis_intro.php), although that hasn't stopped people from trying to repeat this. The fact is that men are widely discriminated against on numerous different fronts when it comes to child custody and other areas involving family court law.  \n\nNote also how hateful this rhetoric is.  This is the kind of stuff that you find repeated by feminists, and it simply doesn't treat this topic in a fair and honest manner.  Fathers love their children and many fight tooth and nail just to get a few hours a week to spend with them. The system is broken and it represents a grave social injustice that is deeply unfair to fathers and their children.\n\nhttps://www.sharedparenting.org/2019-shared-parenting-report\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ilzceq/cmv_equal_child_custody_for_mothers_and_fathers/\n\n####Myth 14: \"Most child abusers are men\"\n\nA majority of child abuse is actually committed by women, and especially by mothers.  This is even more true when you include emotional abuse and neglect instead of just physical abuse.\n\nBy some metrics, the biological father is the safest person for a child to be with. This is because when men do abuse children, it often happens while under the custody of the mother.  Who is sometimes complicit in the abuse or even encourages it.\n\nClose to half of child abductors and traffickers are also women, not men.  And many of their victims are boys.  Boys face sexual abuse and are also used for forced labor and organ harvesting. They are less likely to survive or escape, are less likely to be reported on or identified, and they suffer from higher rates of abuse than girls who are trafficked.\n\nAnd yet very little attention is given to this.  Missing boys, and especially missing minority boys, are often ignored by society and the media. To the point that people often assume that most of the victims are girls.  Something which is known as the [missing white woman syndrome](https://archive.is/mRIJL) (although in Canada there is a lot of attention given to missing indigenous women, even though 71% of missing indigenous people are men and boys).\n\nNote that I'm not saying these things to attack women, imply that they shouldn't receive custody, or to downplay the plight of girls.  Which is a lot more than you can say about people who try to paint men as the villains in this picture.  We should however be fair about what the facts are, and give male victimization, including victimization by women, the attention that it deserves.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16165212\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/childmaltreatment-facts-at-a-glance.pdf\n\nhttp://www.breakingthescience.org/SimplifiedDataFromDHHS.php\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0145213416302599\n\nhttps://www.savethechildren.org/us/charity-stories/child-trafficking-myths-vs-facts\n\n*Fair is fair and equal is equal.  Gender equality will never be fixed if we refuse to look at both sides of the coin.  We need to be honest about what the problems are, and stop ignoring them when they involve men, fathers, and boys.*",

    "text": "Men are actually underrepresented in politics. I've been thinking about this a lot recently. I hear a lot on the intent, reading scholarly articles and official government reports that a good measure of representation in politics is the number of people of your group that are sitting in government. If you look at any measurement of gender equality they always make the assumption that this is aa good way to measure representation. As such women are often present as being underrepresented in politics and men overrepresented. But to me at least that logic doesn't make much sense. There are two main problems with this thinking,\n\nFirst, men as a class do not exist. men do not make political decisions based on the impact it would have on their gender. They do not care and so male politicians have no incentive to support any male positive legislations. If every person in parliament was left-handed that would not mean that right-handed people are not represented. It might be argued that they don't have to do so. The status quo already so greatly benefits men that they don't need to change anything. To which I would call you blind. Men face systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system to such an extent it makes black people look privileged. Like if I was going to jail for a crime, it would be better to be a black woman then a white guy. In the UK at least men make up 95% of the prison population yet the government 2 years ago created a female's offenders stagey to decrease the number of women in prison with no equivalence for men. Despite the academic scholarship showing overt discrimination faced by men in the criminal justice system mens views on these issues have yet to be fully crystallised and have no real way to express themselves. You can thus compare the amount of time and effort put into promoting female issues than men's issues in areas like health where men face significant disadvantage. so for example despite the fact that globally men have significantly worse health outcomes the un spend the vast majority of there gendered health promotion on women. While men enjoy a dominant status in society, their gendered interests have been neglected due to complacency. Women have fought to identify and assert their interests because their interests risked being neglected due to their descriptive under-representation. Men have not fought any such battles, and the gendered dimension of their interests is often overlooked. As a result, some men’s interests may remain uncrystallised even though there has been ample opportunity to represent them politically ([https://zenodo.org/record/4298815#.YB5zquj7QuY](https://zenodo.org/record/4298815#.YB5zquj7QuY)) For me, to actually take into consideration gender representation in politics you need to look no only at the number of women in parliament but also the number of female-oriented policies, the amount to a political organisation is focused to that group's political aims and the amount of time/money used talking about female issues.\n\nsecondly, it would be erroneous to argue that all men have the exact same goals and aims. and that all types of men are represented in government. working-class men increasingly become less representing in governments. they often are being replaced by middle-class women. This is not me being angry or blaming these women. They have done nothing wrong and I am happy to see more women government. But we need to understand that if you went to a private school you do not necessarily have the same interests as a plumber whose mum was a crack addict. To say that all types of men have the exact same interests is completely ignoring the unique experiences different types of men have ( intersectionality has some good points). Also please do not confuse the interest with one group of men to show politics only cares for men. just because most CEO's are men doesn't mean that a country passing business-friendly laws is meant the benefits men. If every CEO was a woman this law would have made no difference. Men are a unique class of people and are not synonymous with anything else.\n\nLastly, there is quite a bit of evidence that the more a group in government doesn't actually help those groups and can actually hurt. When there a few women in parliament many men feel a need to represent the interests of female constituents as more women join they increasingly are likely to leave this to women to whom they believe would be better at advocating for these rights. While this is true in part, women, especially when more of them enter government, can become less likely to support female proposals. As different types of women join with different views the impact of a small but dedicated group can be more effective than a large but divided one. On the other hand when we have large amounts of men in government the assumption is made that they will automatically represent there own interests which is not shown at all.\n\nThe pretty big cavitate I will admit is that I speak only for western nations. Although I'm sure that this does exist on some level in other parts of the world. the impact of sexism may be much greater there then is the UK or USA. and more tradnital views may make the idea that men don't express there views wrong. I just can't say as I'm not familiar with many of these countries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: it's probably a good idea to clarify what I mean by representation and why people get it wrong. Representation is not how many people there are in government. Its the ability for the interests of that group to be enacted on. Men have very little way to get there interests argued for or supported and therefore have very little representation.",

    "text": "Obviously discussing class is essential, but feminists use this as a way to say men have no issues, and IMMEDIATELY STOP DISCUSSING MENS ISSUES, STOP IT, MY FUNDING AND GRAVY TRAIN IS AT RISK Class analysis is essential\\*\\*\n\nHowever,  specifically when it comes to mens issues it is used by feminists as a  distraction tool. For example, a feminist article by a PROFESSOR on a  reputable education publication was so bad it was actually funny (I'll  explain why it was funny in a sec).... she basically says we need to stop seeing  education as a gender issue and measuring girls doing better than boys,  its nothing to do with gender, its class etc. Dont say boys.... which  boys? which girls etc.\n\nWell professor should have know this is bullshit. A rich boy does worse than a  rich girl, a black boy does worse than a black boy, a chinese boy does  worse than a chinese girl, a special needs boy does worse than a special  needs child, a privetly educated boy does worse than same girl..... in  other words, in every single scenario it is a gender issue... gender is the underlying thread.... and as the CEO of the entire university application system said, boys and girls come from the same family, and live in the same neigbourhoods, have same parents, are brothers and sisters etc so if there is a gender gap then of course it is a gender issues not class etc. It is of course class, but it is also a gender issue.\n\nThe  worst example by feminsits is saying for example the forced  consicription of all males in Switzerland and those who cant for MEDICAL  reasons need to pay 3% tax for 10 years is NOT a gender issue, its a  class issues...... that is literally the stupidest thing I have ever  heard in my life.... obviously its a gender issue first then it can be  other things. Or that male circumcision is not a gender issue.... da fuck?\n\nTHis is where  feminsm actually gets misandric.... that above isn't sexism or stupid,  its actual misandry trying to erase male issues due to the hatred of  men. Now I am one that says sexism, misogyny etc are overused and used  where they dont belong, but in this case misandry is the EXACT thing  here.\n\nNow why is it so bad its  funny (going back to professors article)?.... in this SAME article the author was saying not to talk about girls outperforming boys in school etc, she suddenly does the most random segway and IN THAT SAME ARTICLE says the real gender  issue is kids sending dick pics in schools, other harrasment etc and proceeds to  gender the shit out of it only talking about girls.... hey professor  what happened to its not a gender thing? Which girls, which boys etc. why is it only girls now? Are boys not victims of these things?\n\nAlso feminist why dont you apply this to you beleoved gender wage gap? As clearly it isnt a gender issue. Its actually very specific people and groups of people. E.g. parents. And in fact many entire groups of women (not indivuals, but entire groups) of women get paid more than men e.g. in UK part time women get 6% more than men, young women get paid more etc etc..... so why aren't feminists applying this same lens to women issues which by the authors metric shouldnt be gender issues any more? For women EVERYTHING is a gender issue. Air conditioning is gender issue.... yet for men.... literally even the picking of people by male gender and consrciptuing them on a national level.... so imagine twins, one boy and one girl, it only applies to the boy.... IS NOT A GENDER issue according to feminism.\n\nFeminism is not just a hate movement full to the brim with racists, white supremacists, elistists (and before you cry feminists, FEMINSITS themselves say this relentlessly about feminism) misandry and even misogyny ironically...... its just dumb.\n\n\\*\\*And  as I have stated the issue with feminism is that its analysis is  overlym simplisitic. THere are THOUSANDS of reasons behind one simple  thing/what led to that thing e.g. a specific court in London handing  over custody of a child to mother..... yet feminisms one word answer is  patriarchy.",
