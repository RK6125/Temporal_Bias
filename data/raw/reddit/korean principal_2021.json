    "text": "Is it worth it? Dual Immersion. Looking for advice and encouragement. I'm working as a Korean Dual Immersion teacher. 2nd year as a teacher, 2nd year in the program. \n\nOur district is fairly new and I am one of the 4 teachers who are pioneering the program. I am the only person in my grade level. \n\nWe teach in a self contained classroom, so I have freedom in my classroom when it comes to the time and length I want to teach the language. \n\nI've been told by two teachers who teach a different language to not stay in this school. Admin expects so much from us dual immersion teachers, because we are in need of promoting the program. \n\nI feel that we can't eliminate the fact that culture has an influence in our work culture. I feel that asian teachers don't really say no and do what must be done to promote the program and culture. \n\nAll this is great, but I feel that I signed up for too much. \n\nLast year, I've had to use my weekends and many instructional minutes for my students' traditional dance performances. \n\nI'm now sitting here, having to work on editing a video with my partner and adding more to it a week before showcase. My principal told us last minute that we will be hosting an event that invites parents and students. \n\nMy last complaint is that we don't have a solid curriculum. We use a curriculum that our principal and some teachers believe in. However, it is not at all helpful for my classroom. I spend many hours looking up resources that aren't really available here in the States. Some days, I feel it's getting better, but some days I wonder if it's even worth it. \n\nI've really battled internally and I know I'm very thankful for my position. There are many pros to this specific position. However, the cons definitely creep up and slaps me in the face at times. \n\nBeing a dual immersion teacher gives me more stability. Should I stay or should I venture out? With this day and age with our pandemic, I'm just wondering if I should just accept the reality and suck it up. I had friends who have looked for 30 plus jobs and are still substituting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm really sorry for the long post. I hesitated writing about this here. I appreciate any advice or encouragement from you all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy Sunday and I hope you all have a victorious week.",

    "text": "What to do with life? This is a bit of a weird question but it feels right to ask it here first. \n\nFor context I am still young, just graduated university, and landed a very good starting offer at a highly sought-after tech company. I have a new sense of stability - I am not constantly worried about doing Leetcode or applying to companies, I don't have to constantly read the news hunting for a new prestigious startup I could be working for, I'm not obsessively scrolling through Linkedin for a potential opportunity and the list goes on. Overall - I no longer am doing a lot of the tiring and time-consuming things I was trying to get that \"goal\" offer. \n\nThe problem? I feel empty almost. \n\nIt's been weird trying to affirm to myself that this newfound free time I spend on myself isn't being wasted but I'm slowly acclimating. I've hit that \"target\" I've had since middle school and I'm sorta lost now. \n\nWhat do I fill my time with? (Both technically with new things to learn to progress my career and personal life things)\n\nFirst - What is the next step of technical learning to progress my career? I want to grow as a technical developer, maybe become a principal developer in a few years ... reach a CTO level position, and either run development at a company or leave and join a startup as a CTO/Founding Developer (something like that). What do I start doing to hit that goat? I've seen people say to start with AWS Cloud Practioner, Systems Design, Distributed Systems but insight from experienced people would be great.\n\nSecond - What are new things I can do for fun? I do have hobbies currently: I like sports, love to cook, enjoy a wide variety of TV Media from American to Japanese and Korean. What new things can I explore?\n\nI also hope this post can help other students but STEM ones particularly. I've noticed a lot of us have devoted so much of our lives to landing that Facebook or Stripe offer new grad (or whatever is trending now) that we don't know what to do after we've achieved it.",
