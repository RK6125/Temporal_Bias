    "text": "constructive discharge / hostile work env in tx I am currently employed in TX and feel like I may be in a hostile workplace situation but question if my circumstance justifies filing with eeoc or quitting. I fear that constructive discharge would not apply and I would not be covered by any unemployment during the time it takes me to find other work. Fellow supervisors and the owners of the company have made racist, homophobic, and sexually degrading comments in front of me and when I interviewed two candidates who appeared to be homosexual, my direct boss who is the owner of the company, called a managers meeting and read out of the bible about gays being an abomination and how we were forbidden from hiring them. Though I expressed my disagreement and disappointment, nothing has changed. I'm not sure that it will ever because the offenders are the highest levels of management/owners (I am also a manager and a lot of the most offensive parts happen behind closed doors in managers meetings). I believe that due to my willingness to speak  up about feeling as though they were acting unethically, I have been targeted by the HR person/office manager, and she has continued to say things around me that she knows I find to be very upsetting like saying black people are dark because they got burnt from working outside or that indian people are stinky or that she can hardly watch TV because of all the disgusting gay characters as well as insulting the physical appearance of employees. She is not my manager but in the last year she has written me up twice for no reason and has sabotaged projects I have worked on just for her own enjoyment. The final straw was when one of the company owners asked another manager \"if you just had to, which one would you f*@#?\" referring to myself and two other women that were in the same room. I have kept notes with dates that cover some of the conversations and events and would like to see about getting some advice because I am at a loss with what to do tomorrow morning. I have freelance work lined up and would like to start that immediately and never deal with them again but I can't be certain that the freelance will 100% replace my wages so I want to leave unemployment possibilities open. Does quitting because it makes me physically ill to be around people that are so terrible qualify as good cause?",

    "text": "How to find low competition job or how to choose career ? Hi all, my name is Tony and i am 25 yr old. I would like to share my experience in choosing career and picking jobs... \n\nI would like to ask you for career advice...  \n\nI dont know where to start so i will just write down what ever come to my mind...\n\nLike every teenager i had to choose path(career) for myself and work hard to make a living. I started in Video (DVD) store as general labour when i was 18. After that i moved to Australia because all of this \"good life articles\" etc.  \n\nI decided to start with building (construction) because it was fairly easy to get into and money was decent... I was planning to master one field in construction and to become professional...\n  \nI did not count on bullying, pain, long hours, and terrible working conditions, but i was like : \"Hey whatever in few years it will be beneficial if i stay here...\"  \n\nThen after 6-8 month`s i started realising that i would probably need 10 years in this industry to become Master... even than i would need to break my back in order to earn good money (Still you need to fight with customers, run for contactors to pay you the money that you already earn etc...)\n  \nSo i Quited, and i decided to become Security equipment installed, because i finished 4 years DC / low voltage electronic school in Europe (whatever i knew some basics etc...)\n\nI got job, and i started to learn about Alarms, Cameras, Access controls and many other electronic devices...  \n\nI can say that i was really good at it after 1 year, i was able to do solo installation, programming, troubleshooting etc...\n\nAfter that i realised that if you want to have decent money you would need to have your own company (vehicle, tools, customer base etc etc... and still you would have to chase new customers, keep old ones, and a lot more things in order to survive...)\n\nWhen i first started i saw ad`s such as \"75.000$ year, your own vehicle bla bla...\" i was thinking wtf this is gold mine...  \n\nIn reallity, to earn 75.000 you would need to work 7 days a week, and like 12 hours shifts, and to deal with crazy people, shty jobs, far away locations, + you would need at least 10+ years of experience...\n\nAll in all it was shty job, it`s not about how smart you are, its about how fast can you climb on ladders, or run cables on 10m heights, how good you are with hammer drill (not to mention, if you hit pipe or something you would have to pay all damage...)  \n\nSo i quited... Next thing i was get into was factory labour, becase i tough it`s secure job, not that much stress, little bit less money but why not ?!\n\nI manage to get job in factory with 23.5$/ hourly as product line labour... i was really happy (first day)...  \n\nThan i found out that you have to do 12-14 hours shifts with 300 asians ( NOTHING AGAINST ASIANS ) , they have to work 12-16 hours hard labour work in order to stay in country... so you have low chance to compete with them, and there is no room for any kind of complain...  \n\nI Asked my manager after 3-4 month of that shty job, is there any chance to work on promotion, like to become supervisor or something that is not HARD LABOUR 100%, (this job was lifting 10-30 KG constantly for 12 hours minimum, fast paced environment), and She told me yes, there is... Usually you need to work for the company for 5 years and to stay alive without injury or something... and than they can consider option to give you better position or something (for 2-3$ extra)...  \n\nLong story-short i quited after 6 month of that work...  \nI was desperate and almost suicidal because i was lost i had no idea what to do... Than i decided to get into programming because i used to do web development when i was 16-18...  \n\nSimply i started with JavaScript, PhP, Css etc... i decided that i am going to sacrifice 2 years of my life, on everyday learning...  \n\nI finished at least 10 books, 20 online courses from codeacademy, udemy, linda etc... I have like 30 personal websited, bunch of small codes, projects, small web apps, forums, social ETC...  \n\nSo i decided to do job hunt... I managed to find one company (12 yr old with a lot of clients etc.) , guy offered me position to work for free, and to get some experience even if i have 2+ years experience (+ fiver gigs, upwork freelance etc)...  \n\nI worked first 2 weeks for nothing and it was ok for me because i needed formal exp, than he offered me 200$ week 5/7 days, and that is WAY BEYOND MINIMUM WAGE, it`s 5$/hour in Australia...  \n\nMinimum Wage is 15.5$ even if you do most shty job...  \nAnyway i accepted... , after few more weeks i heard my boss talking about \"Overseas monkeys\", how they work for nothing etc...  \n\nSo yeah i quited..., and i tried with other ad`s...  \nProblem is in outsorcing, it`s hard to compete with Indians (NOTHING AGAINST INDIANS) , because they can work for 5$ whole day from India...  \n\nFor entry level jobs in Web - Dev, just check ads , you have to know : html,css/bootstrap/less/sass/js/frameworks/jquery/php/larver/other frameworks/wordpress/customisation/themes/React/Angular/Git/ and all kind of sht...  in order to get entry lvl job...  \n\nSo my 2 years of hardwork+learning = entry lvl job = FAIL\n\nTo be expert or at least fluent with all of these technology above you would need at least 3-4 years + work experience (that you probably wont get, how to find job with out exp... + industry) is already FULL of \"Web developers\" and other specialists...  \n\nAnyway i will continue with improvements and with learning new technologies and programming languages but not that intensive like i used to, because i lost faith about becoming web-dev.  \nReason is simple, How to risk 5-10yrs of your life, with constantly learning new tech, 12 hours of coding, fixing things etc... when you know that all your hard work can be outsorced (overseas) for 5$ etc... I dont know tbh it kinda sux... Not worth at all, it`s all because articles such as \"Web developers earning bunch of $$$\", \"top 10 jobs - #3 web design\", etc.... It`s double side coin but yeah i was naive ^^..  \n\nWell i decided to become \"smart\", and to do big re-search before i dive into new \"career\"... I wanted to do something with low competition, or something that is fairly easy to get into junior position roles. Only thing i wanted is job where you can improve your skills and progress, example: \"road from junior front end dev to Web master bla bla\"...  \n\nSo i saw article \"Nurse shortage in Australia\"...  \nnext ting i done is checking payscale: 65.000-110.000$ , i was :  \n\"Why not ?! , there will be blood but what ever, i like to help people, its decend career with oportunity to specialise latter on etc\"... To become nurse you can go Tafe 1.5 year , or Uni 3 years  \nand i saw info \"86% our students get job even before course ends\" bla bla... I was so happy, because i found something cool, that is worth doing(studying)...  \n\nI did some more research :), and i found out that there is no f***** nurse shortage in Australia, and that it`s only Goverment politics to get more immigrants for some reason i dont know why and i dont care...   Just i found out that out of 4000 new graduate nurses , only 20% are lucky to get job`s, and not the hospital ones... Those jobs are in rural areas, or age care homes far away from cities etc...  \n\nSo i was ohhh thx god i saw all this info, and read all this forum posts, because if i went 3 years to become Nurse (+i would have to work / study and to pay bills by myself etc. struggle) and to find out on the end that there is like 0.001% chance to find job, i dont know i would jump from bridge... \n\nThen i started to looking for something else ofc... and i was thinking, what is fairly BORING, and hard job that not much ppl want or like to do ?! It`s Networking (cyber security etc)... I know that a lot of ppl is passionate about that, and its actually very interesting field, but tbh for most ppl its boring, hard etc...  \nI decided to do re-search of that field...  \n\nLong story short: There is not enough networking job ad`s (in general, network admins, security, all-fields)  \nand existing ads in Australia (at least QLD,VIC) looking for 5+ years experience, list of things you need to know even for entry lvl job with 40.000-50.000$ (that ok money for me, but if you compare it with things/skills that you need to have under your belt this salary SUUUUUUUX)...  also market/industry going up and down, and even 10+ yr experienced guys have hard time to keep or to find new job...  (Tbh , WTF ?!)  \n\nSo i gave up on all those things, and i did google search on low competition jobs (in Australia), and only thing i managed to find is \"Mining jobs\" (I dont want to be rude or arrogant, but only dirty jobs...)  \n\nFinally... My question is: what i suppose to do ? I can become removalist or something like that, because my back will break before 35, and what to do than ? Same thing for coffe or barista... Everyone looking for young ppl, and everyone like femals over males, so it`s not career to get into really...  \n\nIs there some kind of certificate such as CCNA (cisco), or Nurse (diploma), that can really boost your % chances to get a job ?  \n\nAny idea, opinion, advice or anything else is more than welcome.\n\nThank you",

    "text": "[California] Indian-American and I believe I am receiving discrimination at my workplace. Do I have any recourse? A year ago I got hired to a pretty diverse team. The original manager of the department was great and my work environment was okay. About 6 months ago our manager got replaced by a new manager; who I will call Bob. Everything seemed normal and Bob was professional with all of us. Gradually though I notice signs that I am on the receiving end of discrimination. \n\nOur department was originally a quarter Indian. My coworkers left for multiple reasons unrelated to Bob but none terminated. I noticed that Bob replaced them all with White or Eastern-Asian ultimately making me the only Indian in the team. \n\nThis made me suspect something but I brushed it off that it was a coincidence. About 2 months ago, I was not assigned to be a Project Lead after I finished a project that was leftover from my old manager. When we got more projects, Bob gave all of my coworkers some form of project lead position except for me. I was assigned purely as a supporter role. Our old workflow was that everyone was a lead for one project and was a supporter role for a different project. I was the only one that was overlooked for a Project Lead role. The replacements got Project Lead with one receiving two projects. I brought this up with Bob and he brushed it off with that he'd like someone purely concentrated on one role as a contingency; so far I am the only one that has one role. \n\nThe gossiper on my team made an off-remark of how my boss does not trust Indians. I concluded that this was the reason Bob chose not to hire Indians and passed me over. \n\nI requested a transfer to HR and told them that I suspected discrimination as my reason. HR denied my request because the branch did not allow transfers and my claims were \"unsubstantiated\". Apparently they interviewed the gossiper and he denied what he told me. Now everyone is keeping their distance from me. \n\nI would like to quit but reviewing my situation I have concluded that I cannot quit for at least a year. Its a combination of personal professional reasons. \n\nWhat are my options? I am lost on how to handle this.",

    "text": "I was slut shamed as a kid in high school. Sometimes it really bothers me. I need to vent. Well, I am Indian. I am 19 now. When I was 15, I was made to stand up in class, and called a slut in front of everyone by a male teacher just because I was tom-boyish and had way more male friends than female ones. \n\nThat teacher had discussed my “slutiness” with other teachers in the school and they all had the same mentality, so I was looked at by all teacher the same way as Hester Prynne and had an invisible red “S” letter around my neck. They all antagonized me just because of my tom-boyish nature and thought of me as a slut. I was outspoken, they did not like that either. That just added to my shameless slutty nature. \n\nI had no friends. No one at school would even look at me or talk to me. I couldn't ask the teachers for any help. They wouldn't. They wouldn't let me participate in competitions, since I would bring shame to the school with my slutty nature. They'd make me sit in the last bench all by myself. \n\nI was punished way more harshly for meager mistakes than any other kid. I'd have a note written to my parents, or I'd be made to stand in class and listen to the teacher go on and on about character. \n\nMy studies suffered. The last year in the school, in 10th grade, I was sick asf. Missed 7 months. When I came back, I did not get any help from any teacher. I had missed out a lot, and the teachers wouldn't help me with anything. I took supplemental classes and covered up about 200 chapters in 3 months. I gave my exam, i was confident of scoring atleast 75/80 in every subject. \n\nThen the results came. The written paper was external assessment of 80 marks, which was only student dependent. The internal assessment of 20 marks, entirely depended on the teachers. This was a matriculation certificate examination. It had some great value. Turns out, I'd scored about 75 in every subject. Give or take 2 marks. The teachers gave me 5/20 on the internal, on every subject. I ended up with an 83 percent instead of a 95. \n\nI don't even care about the names they called me or how they judged me. I had to cover 200 chapters in 3 months. I cannot begin to tell you how much hardwork and labour it took. And I managed to do well, regardless of my circumstances but they intentionally brought me down with the internal. Even when they knew I needed those marks like crazy. \n\nIt's like they had developed something personal against me for talking to the boys in my class. My hard work didn't matter much in the end. I worked so hard so that I could give the KVPY, a national level science exam for getting a seat in the top research institute in the country. I didn't qualify as my score was below the qualification cut off. \n\nWell done, teachers. \n\nEdit: that kind of behavior on the teachers' part had started when I was 13. It reached it's peak when I was 15. I never realized why the teachers didn't like me even though I was a sincere student and scored well. \n\nThe teacher who called me a slut, used to call my friends into his office and ask them to not talk to me. Since I was a \"bad influence\". If they didn't listen, he'd tell the same to their parents in PTA meetings, and the parents believing a teacher, would make their kids not talk to me. \n\nEdit 2: Thanks for all the supportive comments, Reddit! Really appreciate it.",

    "text": "Burnt my bridges with an employer who was narcissistic, egotistic AND didn't pay my overtime wages. Tl;dr – Former employer turned out to be scum and even refused to pay overtime wages until I threatened to take him to court. \n\nStory starts back in 2015. I had been working part time at numerous jobs for 2 ½ years at this point (after having been full time for a while) and was incredibly frustrated with the lack of income. Some of the jobs I held down would go from giving me 39 hours a week to less than 5 hours, and while I had the support of my husband to keep us afloat, I couldn’t stand not being able to financially provide. So when I interviewed for a corporate but franchised owned hotel, I was ecstatic. This establishment, of which we’ll nickname Vacation Hotel, was a little franchised, family owned hotel that seemed fantastic to work for. I distinctly remember leaving the interview thinking “WOW. I want to work there!!”\n\nIt’s funny, because looking back on it, every employee who came and left had thought the same thing. And boy, did this hotel have more turnover then they let on. The manager – who we’ll name Kyle – had the same charm in all his interviews. He put on a damn good show, so good no one could see how fake it was. He did, after all, go to law school – and the more you got to know him, the easier it was to tell. \n\nKyle had charm. He spoke about how he treated each and every employee he had like family, so much so that he had leant a former employee money for a new car after they had been in an accident.  This was a story he told in every one of his interviews, though you wouldn’t know it at first. He spoke about how he hated large corporations and would treat his employees like humans, not robots. He’d even “randomly give raises” when he saw good performance, instead of waiting for annual reviews. I not only remember these things from my interview, but I began to watch him interview more and more people during my year there…of which, he gave the same speech with the same genuine realness. \nKyle became one of the biggest frauds I’d ever dealt with. Narcissistic and egotistic aren’t words that do his behavior justice. And it took me some time to accept that. Because him and his family “treated” everyone like they were, indeed, family. You fell for it, and you began to do everything you could for them. You felt obligated to be the best employee you can for such a “great and kind boss” who would give you the shirt off his back. Kyle always found a way to rope you in – he didn’t explain in his interviews that working full time did NOT mean you got benefits, in fact I saw many people assume it like I did. No health care, no time off, nothing. You worked for your hourly wage and that was it. This was one of the biggest bummers to me shortly after starting, as I had wished he told me up front in the interview. The second biggest bummer was when he explained he “did not budget for overtime.” No one could give me an answer to how he got away with this. I considered asking him, but I let it go.\n\nYou see, Kyle promised me big things. He was opening another hotel. And after having a 2 ½ year stint of struggling to find work, the idea of a stable career made me ecstatic. Kyle promised me a salary, a positon, and a future. While deep in my heart I had no desire for the hotel business, money does talk. And the numbers he showed me said a lot – it said stability. So Kyle ensured me I’d be experiencing all of this; money, stability, a career – if I showed my worth. He wasn’t “just going to hand it” to me until I showed I was capable. While most employers will promote you and then train you, Kyle did things backwards. He’d train and then promote. Why? Kyle was a penny pitcher. “Why pay me the salary if I don’t know what I’m doing?” and “It’ll catch up to you in the end, you’ll be making more money than you can dream of.” \n\nI fell for it. Kyle did things to make you want to stay – he’d act like he cared for you. He gave multiple employees loans when they fell short on money, though I refused to fall into it. But hell, I did get into a situation where my husband and I wanted to rent somewhere else but our credit was too damaged to get a place, so he called a potential landlord and recommended me for the townhouse we now live in. I was grateful for that, but never let it tie me down. I didn’t ask for it, he was kind enough to do it for me. And while he did a wonderful favor, I know in my heart I would get by without him. \n\nRegardless, I started training with the measly hourly income that every other front desk employee got. I was doing the work of Director of Sales for the hotel, Housekeeping Management, and accounting. It was becoming exhausting, and as Kyle was beginning to open that other hotel – guaranteeing I would be the general manager – I began to look for other work during my free time. I really didn’t want the job anymore. But I soaked up the experience from him until I left.\n\nThe biggest downfall from Kyle was two things.  Number 1 – I began to see that he had a major anger problem. He was a perfectionist. Something told me it had something to do with his nationality of being Indian, and how his father who owned the hotel would scrutinize him for the smallest mistake. Mistakes were NOT allowed at his hotel. Not the smallest, itty bitty mistake. If one of his bills was overcharged by $2, and I paid that amount, he’d go full Hulk on me. The yelling from him started to kill my confidence. My fellow co-workers began to notice how exhausted, tired and stressed I was becoming. I let them know that I was always walking on eggshells, no mistake was allowed during my shift. If it happened, he’d shout and yell at you like you were child, using words like “stupid” and “dumb” – and he wouldn’t pull you into his office, he’d do it publicly. \n\nNumber 2 – Kyle didn’t follow the law. It wasn’t “in his budget” to pay overtime. He felt he could reward his employees with random bonuses (of which never truly happened) as opposed to paying the dues owed. In my “training” it was a requirement to work 45-55 hours a week, 6 days a week.  I didn’t receive a cent of that in overtime, just my hourly wage. I also found out very quickly how heavily taxed you are in pay when you work over 40 hours.  So the extra $100 or so I was “making” a week really came out to be $20 or so after taxes. When I asked not to work over 40 hours, suddenly it wasn’t allowed. I would be stripped of my titles because a “real manager works as hard and as long as they need to.” And I would need to get used to “working 60-80 hours a week if needed.” This was all fine and dandy, but if I was working these hours, I wanted the right pay. He made it clear it wasn’t happening. “All would be paid in due time.” So while Kyle went on multiple trips – London, India, Las Vegas, New York – I managed the hotel. I did his job for him, of which he made clear that I was doing as much. At first it was appealing to be an acting general manager…until it wore me down.\n\nIt wasn’t until a fellow co-worker sat me down and told me up front about how she felt regarding the situation. I was shocked to hear her say she felt I was being used, abused and mistreated. But I agreed with her. She was looking for work, I was looking for work – we both wanted out. I still did my job, but stopped caring very quickly. As the rose colored glasses fell of completely, I saw him mistreat and abuse others. Inside the establishment that seemed so fantastic was really an ugly family who used their employees to gain profit. \n\nI can’t say I would have left when I did if it weren’t for my husband’s accident. In autumn of 2016, he got into a terrible motorcycle accident. He was flown to shock trauma and spent 4 days there, having needed surgery on his arm and knee. Of course I immediately called out of my next shift, but later that day as I waited for his surgery to take place; Kyle kept blowing up my phone asking when I’d be back and if I could return the next day for work. After all, Kyle’s wife (who also worked at the hotel) was newly pregnant and stopped working immediately. So he “needed” me there to “run” the hotel. He didn’t like the answer I had for him – I needed time off. Not having benefits for such a thing, he made it seem like a requirement to return to work. As I had already been losing my patience with him, this became the last straw. Just like I distinctly remember my interview with him, it was the moment in the hospital waiting room that I distinctly remember making a life alternating decision – my family came first. And if that meant being there but not providing thousands of dollars, I would take it. I couldn’t imagine having to rush back to a freaking hotel instead of being with my injured husband, all because the housekeepers needed help. While that was his life, it wasn’t the life for me.\n\nNot even 5 weeks after his accident did I find another job and put in my resignation. I held out until I found a job with benefits, so I could stop paying an arm and leg to the Afford Care Act. I sent him an email, wrote him a hand written letter, and gave him 2 weeks notice. I was hoping to part peacefully, but that wish never came true. A couple days later I was pulled into his office and he spent an hour convincing me of why I needed to stay and everything I’d be giving up (it was always money with Kyle) if I left. I stayed firm, even as he promised an immediate raise and large bonus in my next paycheck. He promised to pay my health care from the ACA and even start giving me vacation time. Having told him three times my answer was final; I was then berated for a period of time that I can’t even remember. It was almost surely a half an hour that he told me I was going to fail in life, that I’d go nowhere – especially without him, and I’d never get such a great opportunity like he had given me. \n\nIt was in that moment, I knew I made the right choice.\nWe left on civil terms, regardless of how he treated me during that moment. I kept in touch – hell, I even did a Saturday or two in shifts for him while I started my new job. And then I filed a complaint with the Department of Labor for unpaid overtime wages. Per the DOL, you have to request the unpaid wages first before you take the employer to court. So I wrote up a letter, calculated from my pay stubs the amount I was owed, and certified mailed it to him. \n\nI heard back the day he received the letter. 13 text messages blew up my phone at once, all about how he was such a great friend to me, how dare I do such a thing, I willing worked those hours, I have no right to “steal” this money from him, how he helped me get the house I live in and how I’d regret my decision to send that letter. \n\nKyle was smart. Kyle knew that if he didn’t pay me what I asked for, it’d go to court and he’d owed hundreds of thousands of dollars to all his other employees who were owed unpaid overtime. It was better for him to pay what I was owed as opposed to everyone else. My response was civil – I quoted the FSLA and once again requested only what I was owed in unpaid overtime. He said he’d have a check for me in a couple days with payroll, and would mail it to me as I requested.  \n\nI was hoping that would be it for us. He’d send his check and we’d call it a burnt bridge. Instead, that Friday that he was going to mail it, he showed up at my doorstep. For 5 minutes he banged on the door like a primal animal – I was upstairs taking a nap and my husband was downstairs, quite frankly, ignoring it. I’ll be honest, we really don’t answer the door unless we know we’re expecting guest, as we get a lot of solicitors in our neighborhood. It wasn’t until I was woken up by my phone blowing up – it was Kyle, saying he was outside and if I wanted the check, I needed to open the door.\n\nF. That. Sh!t. He wasn’t coming into my safe space, my HOME, to berate and abuse me. I wouldn’t allow it. I knew from experience what would happen, as I had seen him withhold employee’s last paychecks until they came to pick it up when he was at the hotel so he could put them down and call them horrible, stupid people. He wasn’t going to do that in my home. I asked my husband to deal with him. According to him, it was hard to get the check – not because he was my husband and not the person the check was addressed to, but rather Kyle kept trying to pass on messages through him. \n\n“Tell her we could have done this face to face, and it’s a shame she had to let it come to this, and that she’s a coward, she’ll never go anywhere, ect ect.” Not hearing it, my husband told him to keep his business out of our home and to hand the check over or leave.\n\nAt the end of the day, I got my owed wages. I know I came out on top, though I’m greatly angered that Kyle tried to invade my personal space at home with his petty anger. I’ve learned a great lesson from this experience, and feel like a much better person after it all. I’ll no longer give all of myself to any employer, no matter what they promise me or even what they pay me. If I can’t divide my time between my personal life and my job, I need to step away from the latter. Because life is too short to spend my entire day away from the things I truly love. A job is a job, but my family is my life. \n\nTl;dr – Former employer turned out to be scum and even refused to pay overtime wages until I threatened to take him to court.",

    "text": "Female studying engineering with mental health issues, need some advice I've come to some cross roads in my life, and need some advice about what to next. (Sorry, it is quite long)\n\nHere's some background. I've completed a three year bachelor degree in engineering science and am now working on my masters in a specialist area in engineering. My long term goal was to always finish my masters and then work in industry. I got average marks in my undergrad and never really enjoyed university. The content was interesting, but I struggled keeping focus on class/study and had terrible time management problems. Was never a particularly happy individual with minimal friends but just accepted that to be my personality.  \n\nFast forward to one year into my masters. Pretty much have a nervous break down and diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Drop out of some units and scrap a pass in others. I attend class sporadically and spend days at a time not leaving my room. Finally psychologist figures out I have adhd and now on a waiting list to see a psychiatrist (which is $700 for the first appointment alone..). I'm miserable, alone, and generally hate my life. I should be graduating, instead I'm 5 units short of graduating and haven't written my thesis (which will take a year). It's not that the content is overly difficult, it's just that the drive I once had is gone and I'm sick of student life/study.\n\nI've got some interviews lined up in technology consulting for fairly reputable companies. The pay is good, but not as good as whats offered in the area of engineering I studied. Family is pushing me to finish my masters, saying I will regret my decision not to complete my masters in the future. \n\nBut aside from my mental heath issues,  being a female in engineering is hard. At the university I attend, my specialist area has roughly 5% females. Even though I'm from my countries dominant ethnicity (white), most of my class mates are asian/indian. I don't have a cultural support group like many others. I don't really know if I want to work in this industry any more, and be subjected to what I have been put though in university. Any internships or awards I get are put down to me being female. In group projects I'm belittled and ignored. I've been asked if I understand first year content while being a masters student. \n\nSo simply... I just don't know what to do",

Unit nursing educator and charge nurse say \"let's go, darkbyrd.\" Escalated to a code blue en route.\n\nGet there and it's already crowded. Pt on stretcher in tiny waiting room in-suite. Got in line, did compressions trading off with residents (wat?). Constantly conflicting orders from doctors getting an airway and icu nurse running the code. Too many chiefs, not enough Indians. Doctors say stop compressions, lead nurse says keep going. Failed intubation. Thirty people in the hall, doing (and able to do) nothing. More bag, more compressions. Rhythm check, clear, and push again. Repeat. No plan to switch off compressions, are you tired I'm behind you, ready. Called after twenty minutes.\n\nWe all get training in how to push. That's the easy part. How to make it happen as a team, that is what makes the difference. After the fact it was admittedly a shit show. Immediate debriefing over the stretcher right then brought up issues with antiquated equipment (guess no-one expected a code in outpatient radiology), role confusion, and looky-loos. Later debriefing with members of my unit revealed shitty management of the code (not by the icu nurse actually in charge, but by other leadership present), ineffective compressions by the residents I was switching off with. I was told I did a good job, I hope it was honest, and not encouragement for a rookie. Later, a private debrief with my management to assess my mental coping with the situation (unnecessary, but very much appreciated) and an explanation on how it should have gone down.\n\nI don't know what I'm looking for with this post. Part of this is just I needed to share it. Unfortunate outcomes are the name of the game. Sometimes even in outpatient radiology. But part of this is I want to be better in my role. My class schedule prohibits me from taking an ACLS course for a long time, even though I've been invited to do so. \n\nPlease share your first code stories. And share your advice for a green tech to do better.",

I was hired as a business analyst out of school with a data analyst side (Python, SQL, Tableau) at an Indian IT consulting company. My plan was to move into analytics but my company put me on bench as soon as I was hired. Unfortunately, my company did not need me as a business analyst or data analyst and instead moved into epic (electronic health record) consultant for Professional billing (medical coding) since January. I had no healthcare background coming in and I struggled with learning epic more than learning other technologies such as statistical programming or SQL querying. I don't enjoy healthcare, I hate epic, but I try to do the best job I can. All my coworkers except one (who was a software engineer) have at least 5 years epic professional billing experience and some have been working in healthcare IT for close to 20 years. We recently got a new client manager and she's getting rid of contractors like myself right and left and is hiring experienced FTE's. \n\nThe new client manager  put me on a Process improvement plan because she doesn't think I'm problem-solving complex issues fast enough independently. I don't have the primary  Epic Professional billing certification only the secondary certifications(claims and remit), lack the medical coding domain knowledge, and to make matters worse epic pays millions of dollars so nothing is googleable making finding answers hard. My new manager told me she is not looking for a junior analyst, she doesn't trust me to do a good job on any complex problem, and I think she been gathering evidence to fire me. The evidence she gathers is weak (for example I didn't respond to a group email within 20 minutes while I was in integrated testing) but because she is my client manager my company will let me go she complains to them.  I can do the basic in epic but there is so much to learn and the documentation is terrible. I'm not sure if I could do a complex project in epic without guidance from other team members.\n\nI have never enjoyed my current project or role but my company won't let me switch projects or roles. My client manager is actively looking to get me get me fired in the next few months.  \n\nI'm applying to as many Tableau Developer, Data Analyst, and Data scientist roles as I can but I am not hearing back very often because of my lack of analytics experience. I only have some summer internships as real-world analytics experience (Tableau and SQL) experience. I completed an online data science bootcamp with Python, do weekly Tableau public challenges, attend meetups, and spend hours learning each week on personal development. I did a good job at gathering requirements, dealing with stakeholders,and testing in my current role and I think I would also be  a good business analyst. \n\nI think after I'm done with integrated testing for my team my manager is going to fire me. \nI worried that if I get fired before I find a new job that I am going to struggle to landing the next position. Should I resign so can say I wasn't fired? I've never been fired before so I don't know the full effect of the stigma? Not a lot of people are hiring during the holidays. Does anyone know any resources or metro areas to look for jobs? I'm willing to relocate to almost anywhere in the USA and I'm single.",

    "text": "Career Advancement Advice: leaving current employer after 2 years? Hello Everyone,\n\nI’m looking for a bit of input, perhaps those with a few more years professional experience can draw from their time in the work force and offer a bit of insight. First some background: ~6 years ago I’d broken into my industry as a sales associate. Having experienced a fair amount of success, advanced in ~3 years time to the manager level at a second employer, where I have been for the last 2+ years.\n\nFast forward to today; I’ve received an offer to join a multinational generic pharmaceutical manufacturer at the Associate Director level, with a fairly substantial bump in pay. \n\nI’m weighing the pros and cons of leaving my current employer, a European based manufacturer, a brilliant group of scientists/engineers/support staff, and joining a new company. In terms of career progression and future earnings potential, I believe this is the right move. Looking ahead, it is likely that I return to school for an MBA, and believe the progression will show well in the application process as well.\n\nI certainly know what I’d like to hear from the group … but I’m open to hearing other opinions, especially any which are dissenting. Implications of moving from one company to another in a relatively short period of time? Am I right to assume this is a symptom of today's job market? Is the clear jump in pay, responsibility and title justification enough? I wonder how far loyalty would take me in my current role.\n\nThanks!\n\n**Personal Info**\n\n* Age: 28 years old\n* Male\n* Single, no dependents \n\n**Employer A (current)**\n\n* Pharmaceutical Drug Substance and Fine Chemical manufacturer headquartered in Europe.\n* Account Manager with responsibilities in North America\n* Base Salary: $85,000/yr\n* Bonus Potential: 15-20%\n* Additional: $5k/yr car allowance, preventative maintenance and insurance paid\n* Work from home office when not on the road.

    "text": "5 Years of experience across 3 jobs, bored out of my mind and I don't know how to get somewhere I might be happy. [Long] I worked for about 1.5 years (including my internship) for a tiny shop writing custom software for other small, local businesses. I was solely responsible for DB, UI, and everything in between for Win Forms applications. For the most part this entailed making custom modifications to our \"main product\" for specific customers. My least favorite part of this job (aside from the pay) was dealing directly with the clients.\n\nAfter that, I spent another 1.5 years doing more win forms development for an international bank. For the first few months this job was great, my manager was insanely knowledgeable about .NET and I was learning a lot. Then he was forcefully moved to another project and before long I got laid off (was a contract employee, company was slashing its IT budget and opened two offices in China).\n\nThe last 2.5 years, I've been developing (or rather, maintaining) an ASP.NET application for a small/medium sized company which services a large industry. It is a very mature application that existed since the late 90's / early 00's. Originally it was a desktop application, then the company paid an Indian firm to rewrite it as an IE-only ASP application. Just after I started here, we paid them to rewrite it again as an MVC application and browser independent. The code quality isn't great.\n\nMy current job is the first job I've ever had where I really like my coworkers. The benefits are insanely good, and while I'd like more pay it's certainly a comfortable wage for my area.\n\nThe problem is is that it's very stagnant. There government does mandate new changes that must be added each year, but it's basically just \"Add X new screens to track some new fields\". Other than that, it's bug fixes and random small side projects. I'm not *learning* anything. There is rarely a task or project I look forward to.\n\nI've always liked the *idea* of getting into game development, but I suspect I'd actually be miserable doing it and the few companies that I would want to work for... Well, I have zero experience in the languages / tools they use.\n\nI also like the idea of working with some sort of machinery or robotics, but I don't have the experience with any low-level languages and I'm not good at complex math.\n\nI think I just need a job where every year or two I'll be doing something new, something different. But does a job like that even exist?\n\nBetween working full time, a very high energy dog consuming a good amount of my spare time, and a social life I don't have a ton of time or energy for learning new skills outside of work so I don't really know how I can broaden my horizons.\n\nI try to tell myself this company has an insanely generous retirement package, great health insurance, and a low turnover rate so I should just shut up and milk it... But it's not a rewarding job, and aside from the MVC rewrite which introduced some actual architecture and new-to-me JS libraries which were fun to learn there is never a project a I look forward to.\n\nAny ideas on how I could possibly go about expanding my opportunities?",

    "text": "Unsure about the normality of my situation - looking for other perspectives Summary: A little over 1 year into career. Joined second company in July. Increasingly met with demands that we don't seem to have resources for.\n\nIt's a small company of around 50 employees. I'm in a team of 4 devs - one senior at the office, two offshore, senior Indian developers. We're part of a data team consisting of 10 people, excluding management.\n When I first joined it was partly due to displaying a desire to help improve the qualities of the processes in the company. Things such as improving architecture, documentations, anything I could get my hands on essentially. I learned that the company hit a bit of a rough patch a few months before my joining as a big customer wasn't as active anymore. \n\nWe had a monthly team meeting, where an officer/executive particpated. He gave some information about plans for the company that left a lot of people on the team in doubt about what he meant, and the future of their position in the company. On top of this there was already a bit of dark mood due to a horrible COO scaring away all sales talent, which isn't helping.\n\nIt's starting to feel lonely at the company, because I increasingly run into things like..\n\n- None of Indian devs participating in team chats. They seem to pretend like they just don't see any messages I send, when I have question about a framework they've been pushing, and when they do answer it's unhelpful short sentences. Nobody hears from them outside of daily scrums unless they have problems themselves.\n\n- Senior dev is also busy, and constantly getting interrupted by other people. He's always very kind and helpful though, but I don't think he enjoys it too much.\n\n- Every developer is working in isolation on different projects. I've suggested code reviews/pair programming to help collaborate more, and manager has said it would be great. It never happened though. I can never get anybody to look at my commits, and nobody else is requesting code reviews or pair programming.\n\n- I have to write all my JIRA tasks on my own, which takes a lot of time in itself, and nobody checks, if they actually match with the expected sprint goals or what's been requested to be done.\n\nOther frustrations include resources and that our manager has been going on about security. We deal with a lot of sensitive data, so that seems like a good recourse. Problems here are...\n\n- He's mandated that we have three layers of security across 3 servers. We have no test setup or production environment, because it's too expensive.\n\n- I've been prevented from deploying other finished tasks, because we can't afford the servers that he wants them on. One of our analysts was pulling his hair out, when I told him that I hadn't been able to deploy some data that he'd been promised, because the deployment server hadn't been ordered for budgetting reasons. Literally just wasted effort at this point, which seems very expensive for an already hurting company.\n\n- I set up a Jenkins server to build, test and deploy from our Git server, but I wasn't allowed to deploy it as we don't have a secure server for it. So instead developers still manually have to log on virtual servers to deploy.\n\n- I'm currently preparing the next version of our web application for launch. Nobody in management seems to have any idea where the hell is being done on it, and tasks are poorly defined for it. Two weeks ago my manager gave me a brief talking to, because I'd agreed on a short term solution with the other senior dev on how this new web application should communicate with a service until our manager had specified exactly what should be done, because he wanted the final vote in this. The problem was related to a lack of overall architecture in the company's software, so I spent two of my weekends, while manager was on vacation, on coming up with a solution that would solve a bunch of other related problems as well as the current problem. I wrote it into a document along with spending a lot time in making some neat looking diagrams. I was proud of it, and senior dev said it looked nice and possible to do. Manager came home from vacation, and called me and senior dev into meeting, when I brought up the problem. He immediately said he hadn't read the document, asked me to explain on whiteboard instead. He ended up respectfully saying it was a waste of time, and told us to go with the solution that he'd originally scolded me for, because my proposed solution wasn't adding value.\n\nI don't know. I feel like this could be a situation, where my job is in danger. I feel incompetent, and I feel discouraged that a lot of my work has gone out of the window, because there aren't resources for the necessary hardware to deploy it on. I fear that somebody from management could walk in any day, and say that our team or I am being made redundant, because the company wants to go in a different direction. I'd have to find my third job within 1½ years then, and I'm not sure anybody would be interested in hiring me. \n\nIs this situation or similar situations normal? How would you deal with it? I have a 1 on 1 with my manager this Monday. Wondering how smart it would be to bring it up there.\n\nSorry for the longwinded post, I'm anxious and couldn't sleep, so I figured I'd try posting here. Thanks in advance for any help or advice.",

    "text": "Worried about my future. Need advice. Not American, but need advice. I graduated from a not very good school a little over a year ago as a software developer. I took a job at a small company straight away, where I was really miserable.\n\n I found another job, which I started in July. It was a huge change. Friendly people, more professional, much more interesting work. It has 50 employees, but is 15 years old, and only within the last few years has worked towards having a real development team. The development team is currently a senior dev, two off-shore Indian devs and myself. They're all around 40 or 50 and very skilled from what I can tell. The senior dev is a fantastic person and always super helpful. So why am I worried?\n\nThe company is in a bit of an odd state right now. It was doing great right up until around the time that I was employed, where it'd been through a merger, and lost a significant client, which was, from my understanding, inevitable.\n\nI think I was hired for a few reasons. The criteria they stated to be critical during the job interviews were that the candidate should be able to understand content of the work and should be enthusiastic about taking the company to the next level in terms of code quality, version control etc., which I definitely am. So I was very happy to take the offer when it came.\n\nReality hasn't turned out that way exactly. The first month was very slow. My boss was away on vacation for the first two weeks, and they'd only prepared two tasks for me, which were done in two days. Also none of the code base was under version control, so I spent a few days uploading all the different projects. It was tedious work, since there were several copies from different developers of many of the projects. After that I was scrounging for anything to do. In the following months, I've been given a lot tasks I would consider to be not very interesting. For example, a misunderstanding from my boss meant that we received an entire web application from an outsourced developer in SQL Server, and I had to spend a week simply translating all the data access.\n\nToday I was invited by our COO along with the senior developer to a meeting with him about a task from a new, big client, which the company sorely needs. I was happy at first until the senior dev told me, he'd asked the COO to invite me too, which isn't the first time. It worries me, because I'm starting to see a pattern of all the critical tasks going to senior dev - everybody values his input including me - while I'm receiving these tasks that don't have much to do with getting into and learning the core of the company's software that it relies on. So at this point, I feel like I'm just there to take assignments, which would distract the senior dev from doing more valuable work. That's fair enough, but it worries me that I have to work on all these other tasks in different projects, when what I really wanted was to get to work alongside him on these more interesting tasks. Currently all devs are just sitting on their own, in their own projects. I'm not very happy with it, I miss actively working on the same code base with someone the same way I did as a student.\n\nMy manager and I had a conversation to assert how it was going after the first 2½ months. He said I was doing exceptionally and surpassing all his expectations, which I was really happy about. I laid out my concern with not working on the more complex tasks. He claimed I was already doing some decently complex work in some of the tasks I was doing, and that I shouldn't worry, because those tasks would come with time. For some reason I don't trust that statement. I'm generally just worried that I'm not smart or skilled enough to be accepted as someone who can work on these tasks.\n\nFurthermore I spent a bunch of my free time doing things like setting up automatic build and deployment, because deployment is currently done by compiling on the developers machine, remoting into one of our servers and copy pasting the .exe file there. My manager was very excited about this, specifically because he'd had a headache regarding the Indian devs not being legally allowed to work with customers data, so this could solve that problem. The problem here is that the budget is closed, and he insists on setting up the build and deployment server on its own separate server. So all that work is null and avoid. It was a bit of a hit considering how important he'd stated it was to improve the quality of the company's software development.\n\nMost people could probably go on like this for a while about things that bother them in the workplace. I think what bothers me the most is that I feel depressed and worried that I'm not smart enough to actually get to work on anything interesting anywhere. I've been considering multiple ways of improving myself. Lately I've been solving a Leetcode problem per night and trying to combine personal interests and improving professionally by learning about crypto currencies. I also generally try to read about proper software design, and smart ways to make a lot of tedious work easier. I've also been thinking about going back and studying at a better school or joining meetups. I feel like if I'm this exhausted just trying to become a mediocre developer that can get to work on more interesting tasks than some of the things I'm currently doing, what are my chances really then of ever getting to work on something I find to be interesting?",
