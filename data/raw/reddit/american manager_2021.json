    "text": "is it okay to be jobless? Mentally exhausted/ready to pivot after 9 years goin the wrong way... I know there are millions who either lost jobs, struggle to get jobs, or maybe just can't get a job for other reasons out of their control. I started out my adult career at 17 when I joined the army. I knew college wasn't for me after I barely was able to graduate with my class in high school 2011. Just didn't see the value in doing the work, so it was difficult to get around to it. I mostly didn't want to be embarrassed by not being included in the graduation stuff, so that was the main reason I actually buckled down and did what was required. I'm not the dimmest bulb on the tree, so my asvab score allowed me to chose \"military intelligence\" as a job. All I knew was that the recruiter said I could make lots of money after I got out of the army, and that was enough to get me to sign. All through my 2, 3 year enlistments I knew I really didn't like the job that much, but being a soldier was relatively easy besides the job specific stuff. I enjoyed it for the most part, but I know that that line of work wasn't for me. After my 6 years was done in summer 2018, I didn't know what to do. Tried college a couple times while in service, and surprise surprise, it didn't go well. Being in the military, and having a Top Secret clearance meant that I was already qualified for several gov contracting jobs. All I had to do was reply to some recruiters on linked in and boom I had job offers for 80k+/yr. I took one in northern virginia where I've been working the past 2.5 years. Recently the company allowed me to move to san diego to do a similar job, but just from the san diego site. I moved out here last Nov after breaking up with my ex of 3 years as well. Thanks for making it this far. I now realize that I've just been making decisions that are safe, and make the most money, while disregarding my personal happiness. At each important juncture in my life since becoming an adult (by american standards) has been for the wrong reasons. I am now completely miserable in my job, but feel that without it, I'll be homeless. My performance is suffering, my depression from I guess childhood trauma(alcoholic mother fought with father) is worse than ever, and I just think the best thing for me is to have no job while I try other things. It's like right now I'm barely able to get through each day, and by the time I get home I'm tapped out mentally. The only real time off I feel I have is weekends, where I try to give myself something to live for. It's been like this for the last few years, and I'm absolutely amazed at how time as gone by, and the same things have occurred like on a loop, and I'm exactly the same as when I came out of the army, but only way worse off. It's getting scary like I'm going to live the rest of my life this un happy. I won't let that happen if you know what I mean. It's like the job is sucking the life out of me, and if I could just lift all this responsibility off my shoulders, and get a fresh start with everything I know now, vs when I first got out of the army, I would actively pursue something that I could actually see myself doing to earn enough money, and not be miserable. But I never really did that because I just took easy options that were not in my best interest. SUre I made lots of money, and had stability, but what is it all worth if my biggest achievements over the last few years are eating food, and paying rent? Stolen from elon musk, but that's how I feel. I'm really good at existing, and it's driving me insane. At the same time, I'm mentally exhausted, feel like ending it all quite often, and don't know who I am really because of my poor choices in life. I just feel this great sense of responsibility, or like I would be letting everyone around me down (even though I already am) if I just said hey everyone I'm gone in 2 weeks. I have asked quite a lot of managers, and co workers, and I feel so guilty for not being up for fulfilling any of my prospects or promises. It's like I've been wrongly going down this road for so long that I don't know how to to turn back. Everyone here is like nestled in their jobs with sights on retirement. I just can't do this corporate bullshit until im 65... Maybe I could be happier in a different corporate bs job, but how does one figure that out when they're 8 years into a career that they hate? I'm 27 now, and don't know how to start over without doing too much damage. I have around 5 months bills saved + about 10k I could liquidate from the stock market, but is that my greenlight to just go for it? Not feeling guilty about anything, or anyone in my job, and just moving on? I really don't know. I'm just sad, confused, frustrated, don't want to continue down this path anymore. There's so many good people who have helped me, or been there for me along the way that I feel so guilty about giving up on this job. I just simply don't want to solve these problems, and maybe there's another set of problems out there that I would be excited to solve? Thanks for reading if you are still here. Why am I so afraid to do something that seems to simple? Is it right? Am I wrong? Should I do my best to keep this job?  Thanks for any/all replies.",

    "text": "27 yo with a Master’s degree | 2 years of job search with hundreds of applications = 1 interview Dear r/jobs\n\nAs the title says, I have a Master’s degree (Biology-related STEM degree). I have graduated in May 2019 and had been looking for a Ph.D. for more than a year. After realizing that it is not gonna happen anytime soon, I’ve decided to apply for research assistant and technician positions in labs. Again it’s been more than a year… I have changed my CV/resume and cover letter more than 5 times throughout my applications and even though I came a long way from my 5-page long CV that had a picture of me and my 2-page long cover letter (yeah… I know) about two months ago I have realized that I still don’t know a lot of things about resumes. Just to give an example, I’ve learned about ATS just about 2 months ago.\n\nSince then, I’ve been reading and reading and reading different job forums, Reddit, a lot of books, Ask a manager, and so on because I don’t wanna miss anything that might affect my chances of getting recruited. \\[Insert venting\\] I am 27 and living with my parents for the last 2 years without earning a reasonable amount of money… I think they see how hard I try every single day to apply for numerous jobs in different places. For my Master’s thesis, I’ve worked until night numerous times, worked during weekends, and even slept in the office 2 times… I feel like I’ve wasted more than 4 years of my life (including the time for the Master’s degree) and I don’t even know what to do anymore \\[end of venting\\].\n\nI am aware of the length of this post but I have no one to ask these things. Every time I changed my resume/CV I expected to be invited for interviews and get a job so I kept applying for months before realizing that I had to write a better resume. That's one of the reasons why it is taking me more than 2 years. I don't wanna waste time anymore hence the length of the post. I have categorized them according to their priority -for me- and I’ll really appreciate it if you can take your time to answer them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**-High Priority-**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Applying late\n\nI’ve read somewhere that the recruiters may stop looking at the resumes after they invite a handful of people. If that’s true, it means my chances had always been almost zero because I have always been applying on the day of the deadline which was at least a month after the publication of the ad. So, does it matter if I apply a week or a month after the publication of the ad even if the deadline is far future?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* ATS\n\nPlease stop rolling your eyes. There is a lot of different and often conflicting information out there written by job searchers, resume writers, and hiring managers. As far as I understood, all the resumes pass the ATS as long as the applicants have all the required qualifications. However, does the ATS rank or at least change the order of the resumes according to the number of the keywords mentioned on the resumes? Connected to the previous point, if the recruiters invite only a handful of people, even just changing the order of the resumes without ranking can affect applications. In other words, what are the chances of a resume to be seen (or seen early) by the recruiters if the keywords are written 5 times, 3 times, or only one time? If it doesn’t change or affect anything, why do you use ATS?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Can I repeat the keywords in every section of my work experience?\n\nFor example, PCR is one of the most basic and often asked technical skills. If PCR is mentioned in the requirements or desired section, can I write “Cloned \\[gene X\\] by using PCR…”, “Determined the gene expression change by using RT-qPCR…”, and so on (i.e. different sentences and examples) under different employment sections? Including the internships, I have about 4 sections in the work experience part and I feel that it may sound redundant to repeat the same technique 4 times but at the same time, it might show that I have a lot of experience using the technique.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Bold keywords\n\nSince recruiters look for keywords and they just skim the resume, I’ve been thinking of highlighting my keywords to get the attention of the recruiter and make it easy for them to skim my resume. Does it make sense or is it a no-no?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tailoring resume\n\nApart from mentioning the keywords in the job ad, how can I tailor my resume for a specific position/ad? Also, I don’t know what people mean by “culture of the company”. Does that really mean anything or is it used as an excuse to eliminate some candidates? Another thing is the “mission” or “values” of the company/university. If I write some of those words people would scold me for sounding boring, using cliches, and writing subjective things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* To relocate\n\nI have seen a lot of times that the ATS or recruiters could discard a resume without looking any further if the candidate writes a different state and I am in a different country… Is there anything I can do about it? For example, I had been to the US (J-1 visa). Would it help if I just write “J-1 visa” right next to my internship while applying for the jobs in the US? Also, I want to learn the reason why the hiring managers dismiss the resumes coming from other states and countries so that I can address the issues in my resume and cover letter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How can I integrate the praises I’ve received into my resume?\n\nNaturally, some of them were verbal and I am not sure if it is okay to include them because practically I have no proof. But some of them were written. For example: “\\[OP\\] completed the assigned experimental work in an outstanding manner. \\[…\\] immediately highly motivated and finished this in the same way!” I think you can understand why I want to use quotes in my resume.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**-Normal Priority-**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* How can I integrate soft skills into my resume?\n\nI certainly don’t want to write self-motivated and leave it at that. But I feel like I would waste space if I write “Self-motivated: Worked independently for project X. Communication skills: Presented results in lab and institute meetings”.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Filling work experience boxes after uploading a resume\n\nAs you most likely already know, most of the time the recruiters ask to fill profile, education, and work experience even though the resumes are uploaded to the system. I have no idea if I should just copy and paste the content of my work experience (to the respective sections of course) or write different bullet points.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Name change\n\nI have an ethnic name that is not difficult to read or write but still unusual. I have seen a couple of times people changing their names to “Bob” and “James” and they start to get significantly more invitations to interviews. It is not like all the recruiters and hiring managers are racists, don't want to hire Asians or African Americans… So, why is that the issue? I want to learn because I want to address the issues that might come with an unusual name. Also, do you know if this is the case in academia as well?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Changing previous job titles to suit the job title of the application\n\nI’ve seen some people writing their internships as “Student researcher” or “Research assistant” to fit the ad. Can I change the title of my internships?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Jokes or hobbies to stand out\n\nSome people mentioned they were invited (or inviting if they are recruiters) because they wrote “cook a minute rice in 58 seconds” or because they had interesting hobbies like wrestling. Does it really work? By the way, I can come up with original jokes so I won’t write cliche on my resume.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Repeating resume on cover letter\n\nI understood that I should address the keywords mentioned in the ad. But if I do that both in my resume and cover letter, the letter would be just a repetition of the resume. How can I avoid that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Salutation and signature on cover letter\n\nI am afraid to address the wrong person in my cover letter. Is it okay if I address my letter to the owner of the lab whom I’ll work for if I get hired? Also, do I need to sign cover letters?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Do these work?\n\nI’ve read that information interviews can help networking which in turn can help recruitment. Also, I’ve read about pain letters that **should be sent by snail mail (??)** Do they really work? I thought of starting a blog to “share my expertise” so that the recruiters can notice my blog or at least be aware that I am knowledgeable in my area. Would it help with my application?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thank you so much for reading the whole thing or a part of it. It would make me really happy if you can address even one of the points I've mentioned in the post. Thank you in advance.**",

    "text": "I left my toxic workplace without notice and I feel so relieved TL;DR - My quit without notice on Friday at end of day, because the environment was so toxic at work. I start my new job next Monday and I am helping my co-worker find a new job. \n\nI took a temporary job as a hospital screener mid-December 30 miles away from my residence due to the scarcity of jobs during the pandemic. Since then, I've been applying and sending résumés every day and stressing about landing a permanent position. Around 15 applications per day, at least 6-7 days a week. After 4 months of searching, I received a generous offer from a company who paid my asking salary starting, with a 3% cost of living raise annually with health insurance benefits. \n\nMy last job treated us (my co-worker and I) poorly. The client had warned us that we needed to have a thick skin, as the area was full of anti-maskers. I thought nothing much of it, because my background was in customer service, particularly de-escalating angry customers, so I thought I'd be fine. Within 2 weeks of being on the job, we had to deal with not only anti-maskers, but ones who would sometimes get physically aggressive that we had to call security and file 3 reports. We dealt with sexually harrassing comments and being touched inappropriately (one nurse at another station would hide when a particular patient came, because he would always sexually harrass her too), and even ones who would make sexist and racist remarks not only to us (we're Asian) but to one of the security officers, who was African-American. At one point, I was advised by one of the primary care staff to call the police on a relentless harrasser, who refused to listen to the clinic manager (she was a Caucasian female; this patient would address the male security officer while she was speaking to this patient, who refused to acknowledge her). He filed a complaint on us, so we had to write an incident report on him, and of course like usual, the police really did nothing. \n\nThe hospital itself didn't really care about its employees, either. If a manager or employee was reported, as long as that person was friends with HR personnel, the issue was swept under the rug. We also had at least 3 doctors from podiatry, vision, and orthopedics, who believed that COVID-19 was an over-hyped flu being used by the government to control US citizens (the few patients who actually cared about the pandemic told us, and so did other employees who worked with them). Worse yet, every time I vented to friends, they would tell me they had similar experiences (dealing with racism and sexism) while working at that town. There were so many instances I wanted to quit on the spot, and thanks to this job offer, I was finally able to, and so did my co-worker. She didn't have a job lined up, but it was damaging both our mental health so she refused to work without me. In the morning, she sent her resignation email. At first everything seemed fine, because they thought I'd still be there to screen patients but at the end of the day, I sent mine: \n\n\"Hello (recruiter) \n\nI quit effective today. I turned in my badges at the (town I worked at) location. \n\nThanks,\n(my name)\"\n\nWithin 5 minutes, an unknown number called my phone, followed by an irate text from my recruiter, demanding the reason why I quit so suddenly. I simply told her that I found a new job closer to me, and they wanted me to start ASAP (which was true). I'm so glad to be done with them.\n\nEdit: grammar",

    "text": "Opinions about Staffmark? One of their recruiters reached out to me through Indeed asking if I was interested in a picker/packer warehouse job for bath and body products.\n\nThey pay 18.75/hour, part-time during the weekend.\n\nThe person who contacted me had a completely American name but when they called me, their phone number was from a different state and they had a thick foreign accent. Ngl, it made me suspicious so I went to the Staffmark website and called their support line to ask if that person worked for them. They did have my application on file and that person did work for them, they said it was one of their remote recruiters. They also do have these job positions available on their website.\n\nI still feel weird about it for some reason, I don't know if I'm willing to give them more info about me, but I'm probably just being paranoid.\n\nI've been reading reviews about this company and I've seen quite a considerable amount say that there's a lot of issues with this company and getting paid. That they will lose track of the amount of hours you worked and try to pay you less, or will pay you a week or month late.  I can't handle that type of stress right now.\n\nDoes anybody have experience with this company or any type of information that would help me make a decision as to whether I should take this job or not?\n\nEdit: I also think it's strange that they have a different name on file for the recruiter who contacted me.  They have \"Sara\" as my recruiter, but I spoke with \"Rebecca\" lol.  \"Rebecca\" said she emailed me an application link, but that the link was currently not working so she would ask her manager to send me a working link.  Her manager texted me a few hours later and said that \"Sara\" sent her my info for the warehouse position.  How would her own manager not know her name?  Unless it's a fake name and they're getting mixed up.  It all seems weird even if they verified that \"Rebecca\" does work for them.  Is it possible they hire out of the country and give them fake names for whatever reason, they just make themselves more suspicious by giving fake names lol.\n\nEdit #2: So it seems legit.  They're having me come to one of their local offices for further documentation and background check, maybe drug test.\n\nP.S. I looked at all of the Ranstad jobs available too but unfortunately non of the times work with my college schedule, so I completed the application with Staffmark agency and hopefully all goes well.\n\n**Super late edit for anybody who searches up Staffmark in the future:** I did end up going to their office.  The pay was actually 20/hr and I completed the application process, or so I thought.  They scheduled my first day, and in the meantime until then, I thought more about my decision regarding this job; I couldn't stop thinking about the comments on this post along with some other bad reviews that I read.  My boyfriend also advised me that staffing agencies tend to be scumbags from what he has observed throughout the years.  The straw that broke the camel's back was suddenly being called on the phone and asked to take a picture of my Social Security Card and ID and to text the pictures to some random number that they gave me, they didn't even tell me who would be on the receiving end.  It's probably one of their other employees, but the way they went about it didn't sit right with me.  Really weird and unprofessional imo, I've never had an employer ask me to text pictures of my SS card and ID to anyone.  So I ended up saying that I was no longer interested.",

    "text": "Confused (AMEX Interview) So I applied for the Customer Care Professional position at American Express. Which is basically customer service. A day after I applied a recruiter called and told me that I was selected to attend their language and accent assessment. I passed the assessment.\n\nThen I was invited to attend a video interview with the hiring manager. This was my first time applying at a big corporation so I was very nervous. I did so much research and prepared SO MUCH. The recruiter basically told me that it will consist of an introduction of myself, my CV, some behavioural STAR questions, and a role play. So I made sure to prepare all of that.\n\nI had my interview just now. But the first question from the recruiter really caught me off guard. She told me to introduce myself, but not about my work. I was so confused?!?!! And I definitely bombed it because I prepared to introduce myself by explaining about my passion for customer service. So, I talked about my educational background, current job and hobbies. She then asked me about my family, my likes, my dislikes.\n\nAfter that, she went on to ask more questions, but I noticed there was no follow ups to any of my answers. I also noticed that she didn’t really seem interested in me through her body language. But at the time I didn’t really think much about it since she wasn’t particularly friendly in the first place.\n\nIn the end, she didn’t ask me any STAR questions. We also did not do any role play. Which sucksssss because role play is my strong suit, and I thought that I was able to compensate for my bad introduction.\n\nThe interview ended in FIFTEEN MINUTES. I’m guessing that I totally flunked my interview :((((( But she did tell me that they will inform on the result next week. I have a feeling that the whole interview was off bc of my bad first impression :(((((\n\nSo my question is this: How the HELL am I supposed to introduce myself when the interviewer EXPLICITLY told me not to talk about work?????\n\nHELP!!!!!\n\nEdit: A few years into the job market, I now know the best way to answer this question. Just talk about yourself, your hobbies, passion, etc. But whatever you talk about, make sure it relates back to the job that you're applying for. E.g, saying you enjoy problem solving-based video games, bc you have to think quick on your feet and the adrenaline feels amazing. This is something that is needed when you work in customer service",

    "text": "[Support] [TW] \"You're too curvy and sexy to be able to wear that to work, it's inappropriate, but.... it's okay, I'm like your mum, I'm just looking out for you.\" This is what was said to one of my female coworkers. By our female manager. \n\n\nSome background:\n\n\nShe is Nigerian, 20 years old, and this is her first job as a carer, she started less than a month ago. \n\n\nHer boss said this to her, backed by 2 other older women that are, essentially, her cronies.\nThey are in a room with an electronic keypad locked door, for which she does not know the code to escape the situatuon. She is locked in for \"privacy\".\nThis is not a meeting, nothing was documented. \n\n\nThis boss is a 40 year old Jamaican woman who has a reputation for targeting young pretty women to bully, for reasons... That I cannot fathom.\n\nThe gender and ethnic background are important because there has already been some incidents of black on black racism/tribalism in the workplace. \n\nWith one black woman viciously shouting at another black woman (originating from a different country) , accusing her of being a \"coconut\".\n\n\nIt is a **non uniform** assisted living project for learning difficulties, uniforms would be too institutionalised for our service users as they are assisted at all ages throughout their life by us to live, travel and experience activities without having attention drawn to them, just because of their need for carers. We should blend in and support, not stand out and draw attention to our service users. \nThere is no dress code, - jeans, shorts, shirts, blouses, sneakers, shoes.. As long as you're weather appropriate. \n\nWe have a high staff turnover at this care home, especially regarding young women. Many have left without ever revealing why.\n\nThis care home at every meeting says they are raising the bar of entry to new applicants, making it harder to get a job here, that new employees WILL need previous experience as we have become outbalanced by workers that have no previous experience. \n\n\nBut in action, the boss has made habit of hiring people specifically **without** experience in support work or care, or English as a first language, in order to be able to take advantage of their lack of experience and communication skills, so when asked to do something morally questionable, or tasks risky to theirs or others wellbeing without the correct or adequate equipment; the employee will simply agree and do it, without question, because they assume that their experienced superior... Knows best. \n\n\nI was told this story just today, it happened very recently. \nThe young woman who confided in me is considering leaving already because of this singular incident, that has happened less than a month after starting this new job.\n\n\nShe further confided to me that she had not long ago been a victim of rape. By her ex boyfriend. \nThe mother of the boyfriend asked her what she was wearing at the time and indicated that it was her fault for her choice of clothes. \n\nShe was wearing nightwear shorts and shirt, in the hallway of her own home.\n\n\nWhen faced with our boss and 2 other women, alone in a locked room, as they are picking apart her clothing choices and mixing reprimands of inappropriateness with.. seeming compliments?\n\nTelling her that her body is TOO curvy, and TOO sexy to be wearing THOSE clothes.\n\nBut \"it's okay, we'll let it go.. 'this one time' we're just looking out for you, I'm like your mum you know\"\n\n\nShe told me that this experience with our boss triggered the same feelings of fear when her ex boyfriend's mother blamed her for being raped. \n\n\nI can understand why she felt this way, but not fully, i don't think that as a man i will ever experience what it's like and I don't think I could ever truly be able to understand that kind fear. \n\n\nThis isn't about me.\nBut I was very angry. I couldn't believe my boss did this. \nI kept quiet, listened, and was glad i was wearing a face mask and facing partially away from her (i was driving in a work vehicle) so it hid some of the incredulous expressions my face must have been making.\n\n\nShe asked my advice and I said that I wouldn't blame her if she wanted to leave, but I encouraged her to get the company head office email from google and complain directly to HR (we don't have on site HR) \n\nI'm here because I'd like to ask 2XChromosome's advice about whether it's appropriate to make a complaint to head office myself.\n\nBut is it my place to do that?? \n\nIt feels wrong to just do nothing. \n\nHonestly, writing this all out is.. Just crazy to me.\n\nI'm starting to question if maybe I'm overreacting. \n\n\nI've written way too much, bless you if you read all of it, I've tried to provide as much context as possible. \n\n\nI could really do with some advice. \n\nEven just a sanity check.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: I forgot to say, she was wearing Sports leggings and a T-shirt.\nMany other women at work wear the same clothes without harrasment or reprimand, including the manager.\n\nNot that it should matter in this situation, but her clothes were perfectly appropriate. \nThe issue my manager had was with the young woman's body being \"too curvy\" IN those kind of clothes, which is.. Beyond inappropriate.\nHonestly. I'm still so upset and disturbed by this.\n\n\n\n\n\n       UPDATE:\n\nOkay, So I've talked with her privately and asked if she'd be comfortable with me making a complaint.\n\nI said that she shouldn't answer now, i was worried she would feel pressured in the moment to just agree with the man that's offering help.\n\nI said she should speak with her support network.\nShe then said that I am her support network, which nearly made me fucking cry. \nI asked her to please try find someone else to tell because it is so important. \nGet their opinion, ask what they think. \n\nShe got back to me and said yes and I've been writing it all up tonight.\n\nIt's like gone 4:45 am now so I'm gonna go to bed.\n\n\nI noticed a kind of unspoken theme in the comments that it was difficult to give advice somewhat because there was a question of this young women's size.\n\nI personally don't think it's an issue, i found out later that other workers saw her upset that day and they say that on that day she was covered up and not showing skin.\nThe leggings were FINE, appropriate and fine. \n\n\nBut for clarity, if it helps build a better picture- \nwe're in the UK and she's like 165cm-ish and about a size 10-12. \n\nI don't know what that is in American, and i hope it isn't offensive to reveal that about her, but I REALLY hope that knowing this makes people go:\n\n \"OH! Well... Fuck, what the hell is this managers problem?!\" \n\nFYI the manager is a size 16\nHow do i know this?\nBecause she inappropriately told us, at work, in a team meeting when discussing parts of her sex life with her divorced husband. \n\nThe way she described it, i felt like I'd been mentally flashed. \n\n\nShe. Is the worst. \n\nOkay, I gonna go now before i say more things that will get me kicked out and my post deleted. \n\nit's almost 5:00am and I'm super tired.\n\nThank you to everyone that commented.\n\nEVERYONE.\n\ngenuinely, i might not have responded much because each time i started writing a response i just felt like I was being inappropriate or disrespectful or insensitive so i deleted pretty much everything i started to write. \n\n\n\nBut i read each and every comment, all, many times.\n\nAnd it's really helped, I'm so glad i posted here.\n\n\n✌️\n\n\nThanks, you've all been so helpful and welcoming thank you all so much 🤘🤘",

    "text": "Consent should be taught in every school   \nI think that consent is CRITICAL for children's education. It is important because it allows them the courage to say no when others try to groom or assault them. Also, it is important because many children are assaulted and have no way to process that trauma as adults. It is estimated that 1 in 3 girls and 1 in 6 boys are assaulted, with the average age at the time of assault being 9. It will take a lot to end these atrocities, but I think that teaching consent is the first step. So I would like to start a letter writing campaign to representatives. To make it easy, I've posted a template for the letter below and a link to find your representative so you know who to email. Please help me change this! As of now only 9/50 states teach consent as part of sex education! This is unacceptable and we can make all the difference!!!\n\n  \n\n\n[Find your Representative here.](https://ziplook.house.gov/htbin/findrep_house?ZIP=)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLetter Template:\n\nDear Representative \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_,\n\nI am writing because I believe that consent should be taught in schools in America. In a society where 1 in 3 girls and 1 in 6 boys  are sexually assaulted, something needs to be done. \\[1,2\\] The average age these children are affected is 9 years old. \\[3\\] The cost of this abuse is 23 billion dollars annually. \\[4\\]\n\nConsent is an important part of sex education, but it doesn’t need to be sexual in nature. There are age appropriate ways of presenting consent and teaching children that they have control over their own bodies, and they can say no if they do not want something. Helping children understand this and recognize warning signs will give them power over their body to mitigate grooming strategies from perpetrators and the tools to inform other adults about the abuse.\n\nPlease create federal mandates for ALL schools in the US to be required to teach age appropriate consent lessons to every grade K-12. Our current system is not enough.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration of this issue.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

    "text": "\"I don't know if she has a husband.\" I'm still shaking, I've never done anything like this before. 27F Living in a Latin American country as an expat. I've had several instances of one off street harassment, but today I just couldn't take it.\n\nI was walking to my (socially distanced) yoga class about 3 blocks away from my condo earlier this morning, when I went down the side street I normally take because of the shade (it's hot summer here in South America). I was alone and in my gym clothes when I saw a man standing on the sidewalk in the shade wearing a blue vest that represented him as the daytime neighborhood watch of this particular block, wearing the municipal insignia. There was a big dog which I recognized as a local street dog standing directly in front of him taking up the sidewalk, so in order to avoid getting too near the dog and man, I stepped off the sidewalk and went a little out of my way into the street.\n\nAs I passed, the neighborhood watchman looked me up and down and said \"Mmmm.. a la mier...\" like I was a piece of meat. I was instantly angry but in that moment I just turned my head and glared at him, not wanting to be late to my class or start anything with this man while alone.\n\nI arrived at the gym, whose manager is also a local councilwoman, and told her and my yoga teacher about what had happened, and we agreed that after the class my teacher would walk back with me and see what was up. I did my best in my class trying to forget about it, but as we were laying in shavasana corpse pose trying to meditate it kept coming to the front of my mind. I felt dirty and even questioned myself about what I had heard.\n\nAfter the class, my yoga teacher walked with me home, going out of her way to help. We saw the watchman again and confronted him, saying \"You know what you did.\" He vehemently denied it, and even tried to say that his comment was meant for the dog and not for me. My teacher and I left it at that and then she walked me the rest of the way home.\n\nWhen I got to my condo building, I asked our doorman if he knew the watchman from this other street. He said he didn't know his name. I asked if he could find it. Then, I got inside and told my boyfriend about what happened. He said \"Let's go\" and I thought for a moment he was going to beat the crap out of this man. I could tell he wanted to.\n\nInstead, we walked to the nearby park where there's a municipal security watch group, and told the *serenazgo* (municipal police) about what happened. They agreed to take us in their truck to the wathcman's position and talk to him with a municipal official since this watchman was wearing a municipal insignia.\n\nWhen we arrived and talked to the watchman, the official and my boyfriend introduced themselves and said \"Look, I don't want to accuse you of anything, but you've disrespected my girlfriend and we want an apology.\" At first the watchman denied having done anything, saying \"I'm a man of god, I have daughters, I wouldn't disrespect anyone, I've seen her walk by several times and never said anything,\" to which I said \"Yes, you took advantage of this opportunity because unlike other times this time it was just you, me and the dog.\" Finally,  the municipal official said that street harassment was punishable by up to 3 years in jail and he didn't want to take this case that far, but if there had been any disrespect to give an apology.\n\nSo, the watchman apologized first to my boyfriend, and then to me, and I reluctantly accepted. As he finished his apology, he said \"Well, I don't know her, I don't know if she has a husband.\" (I don't he's my boyfriend, but whatever).\n\nI instantly felt validated in my experience. For a moment when he was denying it I wondered if I had overreacted. He was trying to gaslight me into thinking nothing had happened. But with those words, he acknowledged it. To this man, I was only worthy of respect because I'm the property of another man, not a person in my own right.\n\nI've come to expect and handle a certain level of street harassment living here, but I just couldn't take knowing that some other woman walking down that street would have to deal with this creepy watchman or knowing I may see him there again.\n\nIn other news, I'll be avoiding that side street while walking to my yoga class in the future, just in case.\n\nTL;DR: Creepy neighborhood sanctioned watchman made a sexual comment while I was walking to my yoga class, went with my teacher and later my boyfriend and the neighborhood gov't and he denied it. Finally, he apologized and said he didn't know I had a husband.",

    "text": "I want a fucking hysterectomy I’ve been dealing with PCOS (poly cystic ovarian syndrome) for ages now. Heavy periods that will leak through both pads and tampons, facial hair, weight issues and sheer, unrequited pain. Most of my period I would spend hunched over the toilet puking my guts out. About 5 months ago my doctor started me on birth control for it. It worked at first, and I’m still taking it, but as of late it’s been getting bad again. A few of the cysts have ruptured, and I’ve had to start taking ridiculous amounts of painkillers to keep it from hurting. It hurts my performance at work because I have to bend over a lot, and the constant pain hurts my back. I’m so fucking tired all the time. I went to the doctor today and they told me that if it were any other circumstance given my history with this, then they would probably have to go to the police to report an attempted suicide due to the fact I was taking major amounts of ibuprofen a day to even make a dent in the pain. Of course, I realized that taking ridiculous amounts would do more harm than good so I stopped, and haven’t taken anything for about a week now. Even though my most recent period is over, it still fucking hurts. I fucking hate my body. I probably won’t be able to have kids anyway with this shit, so what is the point of having a useless reproductive system? In the United States, a woman can’t usually get a hysterectomy unless she is older or has some sort of cancer. I’m 19 and can barely bend over anymore, and I have doctors thinking I’m suicidal. In the UK, they can actually remove the ovaries due to PCOS. The US healthcare system is a fucking joke and I’m sick of it. I want to live my fucking life but I’m too miserable to do anything about it. I can’t sleep at night, it hurts too much to lie down on my side or back, and on my stomach I can’t breathe very well. \n\nI told my doctor this. You know what they said?\n“Here, this is what my doctor told me after I had a C-section. Take 800mg of ibuprofen, and 1000mg of acetaminophen for the pain.”\n\nTHAT WAS TEMPORARY. MY BODY IS TRYING TO DESTROY ITSELF UNTIL IM IN MY 40S! AND DIDN’T YOU JUST ACCUSE ME OF TRYING TO KILL MYSELF?\n\nI’m honestly surprised that I’m NOT suicidal over this. I want to be able to do my fucking job, I want to have a life, I don’t want to have to sit down all the time and be in miserable pain. I’m sure my manager thinks I’m putting on a show to get out of work. It’s not true. I love being a tour guide, I love going down into the cave and showing people around, but with the recent developments it’s becoming almost impossible. The doctor said there are other forms of birth control that might work. Problem is I already take so much medication to keep me from being insane due to bipolar disorder and ADHD, and this is just a fucking turd on the shit cake. \n\nFuck the American healthcare system. I want this useless fucking thing out. Sorry for the rant, but being a woman like me fucking sucks the biggest donkey dick.",

    "text": "Birth Control Journey: Nexplanon & Larin Hello friends! I have had quite a birth control journey, and thought my experience might help a few of you when it comes to figuring out birth control (I wanted to post here as this community had a wider reach than the birth control subreddits, but I will remove if asked by mods)\n\nBackground: I am a 24 year old woman in the US. I had never used birth control in my teens or college years, but found a lovely relationship in 2019 and thus found myself looking for some birth control. \n\nWhen I first went to look at birth control options, I was looking for something that was not a daily pill (worried about my own responsibility) or any sort of intrauterine device (worried about pain management within american healthcare centers). This led me to Nexplanon, a 3 year implant that goes into your arm, using a numbing shot. This sounded like the perfect option for me; pain was managed upon insertation, no day to day maintenance was needed, and it has an excellent history of preventing pregnancy. I even spent hours researching Nexplanon, both within reddit and the wider web. \n\nAlas, this option was NOT for me. I was on Nexplanon from October 2019 until about a week ago, so a year and a half, and it was a year and a half of hell. I bled nearly constantly; it was definitely a smaller amount than a typical period, but enough that I had to use a tampon roughly 2/3 days. And with that bleeding came full blown PMS symptoms. My body reacted as if I were on my period full time. Bloating, mood swings, feeling ugly/ insecure/ unworthy/ anxious, cramps, headaches, and acne. Nothing I could do could mitigate the fact that my body truly believed that I was on my period constantly now. \n\nAlongside the constant bleeding and PMS symptoms came a whole host of other unwanted side effects. I gained nearly 50 pounds in the last 18 months (some of that surely came from my Covid lifestyle, I cannot deny that, but Nexplanon played a heavy role). I was suddenly and unendingly unable to control my emotions at all. I have cried multiple times nearly every day, over the most minuscule of things. Unpacking groceries? Tears. Random thought that I could’ve been a better sister growing up? Sobbing. Waking up from a cheating dream? Uncontrollable hysterics throughout most of the day. I found myself unable to drink more than 2 glasses of wine, ever, because I would black out and cry all night. My sweet, loving boyfriend spent the last year and a half tiptoe-ing around me, because any innocent joke or mention of him wanting to play video games sent me spiraling down into a night of tears. \n\nI stopped wanting to do anything. I required at least 3 hours warning for things like running up to the grocery store or going to a casual happy hour. I cried at tv shows, at cute dogs I passed while driving, at EVERYTHING. I was suddenly hyper- paranoid that an intruder would appear in the house, and was constantly on edge, checking the house, the locks, the shower, etc. I was super tired all the time, and needed a minimum 8 hours of sleep to function. I was irritable without cause. The list goes on and on. \n\nThe only positives of Nexplanon I can think of are the fact that it was so low maintenance/ involved no action on my part, and the fact that it cranked my libido into over drive. \n\nFast forward to last week, and I finally removed the Nexplanon in favor of a new daily pill, Larin Fe 1-20. I never wanted to rely on a daily pill, but it was the next best option for me. I spent 4 days on no birth control whatsoever (pharmacy problems, fml), but have now been on Larin for nearly a week. I have seen no side effects at all, I feel lighter than ever, more easy going, carefree, happy. I’ve only cried once in the last week, and that was due to circumstances that actually made sense. My period is finally gone, and the best thing? Larin Fe 1-20 only has 4 placebo pills per pack, that are skippable, so I can choose between no period or a 4 day period.\n\nI plan on coming back to update this post on my Larin experience, positive or not, for any future women looking for new birth control options. I do have to say, I am so so hopeful that Larin will work for me. As my closing thought, I want to say fuck the US healthcare system, and all healthcare systems globally, for doing the absolute minimum when it comes to women’s healthcare, research, investment, and long term studies.\n\nWishing you all a great day, and an even better birth control journey!\n\nEdit: After 6 weeks of Larin Fe, I can happily say that this pill has worked wonderfully for me! I have no side effects to note, other than having a 3 day period despite skipping the placebo pills. I will most likely start to take the placebo pills from here on out, as it seems my body would prefer to have a period still, but this mini period came with no cramping or mood swings or any other typical side effect of a period. All in all I am so incredibly pleased with how well Larin has worked out for me!",

    "text": "How did you leave a toxic workplace? 30F. I work in tech and I wanted to quit before the pandemic, but family and friends said that I should be grateful to have a job when millions of Americans were getting laid off.\n\nI've been at this company for 3 years now. The job is not hard, but the people are toxic. They curse and yell constantly about little things. We're not saving lives here. They have shouting matches over date formats, and my manager promotes this kind of behavior. I've worked at fast-paced companies that were women-friendly, so I know this is not normal.\n\nAs the only woman on the team now, I get the brunt of it. The thing that has been pissing me off lately is when I have a meeting, I hear \"no, no, no, no, no\" in the background before I even finish a sentence. They constantly interrupt and talk over me, even when they have no idea what they're talking about. This happens 3-5 times daily.\n\nNot to mention the blatant sexism. My favorite example is when a group of 5 male colleagues told me to have kids \"before it's too late\" and in the same breath, called a colleague lazy for having been on maternity leave twice. She quit during the pandemic. This same group called me their secretary and would ask me to schedule things until I lost it on them one day.\n\nMy strategy for dealing with them has been to talk louder, and dish them the same amount of attitude. This seems to be working, especially when nothing else has worked, including talking to HR. They told me they hired me because they needed more women on the team, even though I have 3 certifications and I'm more qualified than most of the team. Also, this is the 3rd time I've transferred teams, and it's the same story on every team. Company culture is broken here.\n\nSo I feel disrespected, bullied, and beat down constantly. I've worked nonstop for the last 10 years, and saved close to 7 figures. The job pays $150k-180k, depending on the year, so it has been hard to let go. I have been applying to jobs since August 2020, and I have not had any luck. I've sent \\~250 applications, had 12 interviews, worked with 3 recruiters from different agencies, and had 2 offers that were with companies that are equally or more toxic. I'm not about to leave one dumpster fire for another, especially if the salary is less.\n\nI've reached my breaking point and I'm ready to just leave without a job lined up. I feel especially bad because I was advocating for more women to join tech, but it is a dumpster fire in the U.S. I worked in tech in Singapore and they are workaholics, but I did not experience this kind of sexism. There were women in management everywhere.\n\nIt's easy to say just leave, but how did you actually do it? If I quit, I won't have health benefits, which is something I'm worried about, and I won't be able to collect unemployment. I'm also leaving behind a cushy salary and feel that my mental health might be worse if I had to worry about finding a new source of income.",

    "text": "How to Respect My Elders and still Practice Evidence Based Medicine I graduated IM residency from a mid-tier program this past June and went into community private practice with a group of older doctors. They were extremely welcoming and nice about showing me the ropes of what primary care is really like in the community compared to academic inpatient-heavy internal medicine. I appreciated their patience teaching me things I had only read about.\n\nHowever, I'm starting to have this problem about more esoteric or grey areas of internal medicine. In residency, we would often dismiss the remarks of older doctors who were clearly not familiar with more recent literature. We would then defer to the senior resident, fellow, or just plain old literature review if we felt the attending was out of touch. Now, the older doctors may show me how they practice their own way, but I can also practice how I want for my own patients because I'm also a board-certified internist (at least that's what the paper I got from ABIM says).\n\nThis is all fine and dandy if we were able to practice however we want for our own patients, but this is a group practice and there's a lot of cross coverage. I recently had a patient who got upset at me because I changed her management by citing studies, but the patient got upset because this was different from what her usual primary care doctor had been doing for her and the patient was fiercely loyal to her primary care doctor. This doctor is someone who has 20+ years of experience and has one of those Fellow of the American College of Physicians distinction. I backed down because 1) this patient wasn't on my panel 2) I didn't think there were serious patient harms to what this other doctor was doing.\n\nWhat bothers me is how do I respectfully tell more experienced physicians that my literature review shows that I'm trying to learn and practice evidenced based medicine? Maybe this is a psychological holdover from residency, but I was always taught to defer to what the more experienced physician thought.",

I'm going to try to outline some of these areas of weakness, and close by summarizing steps we can take to fix our system *for our patients.* Change is going to take all of us.\n\n# High Cost But Poor Value: The US Healthcare System Today\n\nOur patients experience insufficient access to care.\n\n[The US spends a much higher percentage of its gross domestic product (GDP) on health care than other wealthy countries](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-271.html).  However, the US performs poorly on many quality measures compared to other countries, including avoidable hospitalizations and deaths.  Why practice medicine, if we can't *get access* to help our patients?\n\n On a per capita basis, the U.S. spends more than double the $3,453 average of all OECD countries.\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.dpeaflcio.org\\/factsheets\\/the-us-health-care-system-an-international-perspective](https://preview.redd.it/wi3ii0hlvle71.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=28b7b0793319f64994e52338060e34834c3157e9)\n\n[**Health care access, quality, cost, and outcomes vary** between different regions and states within the US.](https://www.medicare.gov/)  For example, [12 states did not expand their Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act of 2010](https://www.medicaid.gov/), creating a coverage gap for people in these states who do not qualify for either Medicaid or subsidies with the purchase of private health insurance. Further, [prices for an identical health care service can vary dramatically by region](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Healthcare-Financial-Management-Seventh/dp/1567937063). (Read about this USA Today article on the same care in [different states](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/01/health-exchange-prices/3797039/), as an example).

Accordingly, a health care system should strive to provide access and treatment to all population groups regardless of identity and socioeconomic status, while ensuring that underprivileged groups are not ignored.\n\nRecognizing and addressing inequalities due to social health determinants can improve the health of the most vulnerable and at-risk groups. For example, [social justice](https://www.apha.org/what-is-public-health/generation-public-health/our-work/social-justice) in health care is the delivery of high-quality and fair treatment, regardless of an individual's age, race, ethnicity, economic status, disability, or sexual orientation.\n\n# What can be done about all of this?\n\nThe most important step is to learn how our system (and specifically it's failings) are influencing the health of our patients.  We must acknowledge and address our role in changing it.  We need to look at how other countries allocate resources in ways that benefit more people (e.g., set up a budget inclusive of underserved populations). We need to provide training to ensure health care providers are culturally competent and advocate for patient rights.  We also need to create diverse care delivery models.\n\n# It starts with each of us.\n\n**You can** help fix the illogical things the USA is doing in medicine, medical education, and healthcare policy without sacrificing as much as you think. Where to start? Talk to each other. Share your goals, struggles, and challenges. Join together. Drop the poisonous attitudes, the fights, and the competition. Smell the roses. It just takes some common sense, optimism, communication, and compromise. It takes all of us working for our patients.\n\n**Today, I'm hoping to encourage all of you to** seek progress. We need to acknowledge this responsibility before things worsen. Perhaps you're discouraged, isolated, and overworked. You're not alone. We are waiting for others to fix medicine, but it's got to be us.  The status quo has got to go. How will you stand up to it?\n\n[Healthcare workers \\(and our patients\\) need to get more active in politics. ](https://preview.redd.it/c71gv3x4sle71.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f3e7ca0da93541a075af89a3210db36b8ccd43e)",

There are two widely used health insurance payment models, which are used by both public and private health insurance systems: fee-for-service and value-based performance models. \n\nGovernment-funded health insurance: any of the federal social healthcare programs enacted with the revisions to the Social Security Act aimed at providing health insurance to specific groups\n\n#### Medicare \n\n* **Eligibility**\n* Individuals ≥ 65 years old \n* Patients with end-stage renal failure or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n* Individuals with permanent disabilities **irrespective** of age\n* **Parts**: The two main coverage options are Original Medicare (part A and part B) and Medicare Advantage (part C). Individuals also have the option of adding part D to their main coverage.\n* Part A: hospital care, hospice care for terminal patients, skilled nursing facility care (if services are needed daily after a minimum 3-day stay in a hospital)\n* Part B: doctors' fees, emergency department visits, diagnostic tests, rehabilitation\n* Part C (Medicare Advantage Plan): all services covered by parts A and B, plus a private insurance plan\n* “All in one” plan that allows people to enroll in a private health insurance plan approved by Medicare\n* Medicare pays other organizations, e.g., insurance companies, hospital systems, and managed care organizations, to provide care.\n* Part D: prescription drugs \n\n#### Medicaid \n\n* **Funds**: jointly funded by the state and federal government\n* **Eligibility**\n* Nonfinancial\n* Beneficiaries must be American citizens or lawful permanent residents.\n* Individuals must live in the state in which they receive their coverage.\n* Financial: households with an income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level (which includes individuals, families, and pregnant women)\n* All low-income Americans < 65 years of age\n* Children at 133% of the federal poverty level are covered in every state.\n* Coverage for adults with an income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level is decided by each state.\n* **Coverage**: hospital care, laboratory tests, diagnostic tests (such as x-rays), doctors' visits, skilled nursing care, vaccinations, home health care\n\n#### Children's health insurance program (CHIP)\n\n* **Eligibility**: uninsured children of families with low income, but not low enough to qualify for Medicaid\n\n### Private health insurance\n\n* Used by more than half of the American population\n* May be employer-sponsored (most common) , college-sponsored, or purchased individually\n\n### Self-pay patient \n\n* Individuals who pay out-of-pocket for a health care service and do not have any third-party coverage from a government entity (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid), private health care insurer, or plan\n* Typically includes patients who:\n* Cannot or do not want to pay a fixed monthly premium\n* Have chronic or preexisting conditions not covered by an insurance company\n\n### Health insurance premium\n\n* **Definition**: a payment made to the health insurance provider, typically monthly. Premiums usually depend on the policy type and individual risk.\n* **Characteristics**\n* The premium depends on the type of policy and individual factors (e.g., individual or family plan).\n* The deductible, copayments, and coinsurance are paid separately.\n* It can be paid by individuals (monthly), an employer, or both.\n* If individuals receive insurance through an employer, they pay the premium through payroll deductions.\n* Generally, plans with a higher premium will have lower out-of-pocket expenses (i.e., a lower deductible and copayments).\n\n### Out-of-pocket expenses\n\n* **Definition**: payments made by individuals to their insurance company, including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments\n* **Out-of-pocket maximum**\n* An annual limit on the amount of money that an individual has to pay for covered health care services in a year (not including premiums)\n* After this amount is reached, all covered health services are paid in full by the health plan for the rest of that plan year.\n* Payments that apply to the deductible, copays, and [coinsurance](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Np0-pS#Z6f7d0c999a703be7e1584990b30000c4) also apply to the out-of-pocket maximum.\n\n### Deductible \n\n* **Definition**: a predetermined amount paid out of pocket by the patient before the insurance company begins to pay\n* **Types of** **deductible**\n* Comprehensive deductible: applies to and includes all areas of coverage of the health insurance policy\n* Noncomprehensive deductible\n* Applies to specific areas of coverage or medical expenses in a health insurance policy\n* Not all medical areas of coverage in the plan have a deductible.\n* Individual deductible: a deductible that each individual in the plan pays\n* Family deductible: a deductible that usually applies to two or more individuals\n* Embedded deductible\n* Two deductible amounts within one insurance plan (individual and family)\n* Each member contributes the same amount towards meeting the deductible.\n* Once a member of the plan meets the deductible, the individual becomes eligible for copayment and coinsurance (out-of-pocket expenses).\n* True family deductible\n* Members can meet the deductible by pooling expenses.\n* Can be met by all members or just one member of the family\n* There is no limit to the amount each member can pay towards meeting the family deductible.\n* Once the deductible is met, the entire family is eligible for copayment and coinsurance.\n* **Characteristics**\n* Typically annual\n* After the deductible is paid, the individual usually only pays for copayment or coinsurance for covered services.\n* Generally, plans with lower monthly premiums have higher deductibles and vice versa.\n* If the individual is healthy and does not expect costly medical services: higher deductible and lower premium\n* If the individual has a medical condition and expects costly medical services: lower deductible and higher premium\n* **Example**: A $2,000 deductible means the individual needs to pay $2,000 in medical expenses. After reaching that amount, the insurance provider covers the remainder.\n\n### Copayment \n\n* **Definition**: a **fixed amount** paid by the patient to a health service provider at the time of the service (e.g., doctor's appointment, filling of a prescription)\n* **Characteristics**\n* Typically defined in the insurance policy\n* Paid each time the patient receives medical services\n* The amount can vary by the type of service (e.g., prescription drugs, lab tests).\n* Meant to discourage individuals from seeking unnecessary medical care\n* Sometimes counts towards meeting the deductible\n* Generally, plans with lower monthly premiums have higher copayments and vice versa.\n* **Example**: a health insurance plan that allows a doctor's appointment cost of $100 and sets the copayment for this service at $20\n* If the individual has not reached the deductible, they will pay the full amount for the visit ($100).\n* If the individual has reached the deductible, they will pay $20 at the time of the visit.\n\n### Coinsurance \n\n* **Definition**: a payment of a predetermined **percentage** made to the insurance provider after the individual has met the deductible\n* **Characteristics**\n* Refers to the individual's share of the costs of a health care service\n* Must be paid before any policy benefit is paid by the insurance company\n* This applies to covered services and is paid in addition to the copayment.\n* Typically paid after the individual meets the deductible\n* Billed by the provider directly to the individual\n* Generally, plans with low monthly premiums have higher coinsurance and vice versa.\n* **Example**: If an insurance plan covers 85% of the costs, the individual is responsible for the remaining 15% (this 15% is the coinsurance).\n\n### Health insurance network (preferred providers) \n\n* **Definition**: a group of health care providers, suppliers, and facilities that have a contract to provide services to members of health insurance plans at a discounted rate\n* **In-network**\n* A health care professional, hospital, and/or service provider who has a contract with the insurance company to provide services at a discounted price\n* In-network copayment and coinsurance usually cost less than out-of-network copayment and coinsurance.\n* Exclusive provider organization (EPO) and health maintenance organization (HMO) plans only cover in-network care, except in the case of a medical emergency.\n* **Out-of-network**\n* A health care professional, hospital, and/or service provider who does not have a contract with the insurance company to provide services at a discounted price\n* Out-of-network copayment and coinsurance usually cost more than in-network copayment and coinsurance.\n* Preferred provider organization (PPO) plans may have out-of-network care coverage. However, the out-of-pocket cost for out-of-network care may be significantly higher than for in-network care.\n\n### Health care payment models \n\n* **Fee-for-service**\n* Health care providers are compensated by the insurer and/or patient for **each individual** **service** provided (e.g., individual laboratory tests, imaging studies, procedures).\n* Dominant payment model in the US\n* Incentivizes health care providers to overtreat patients because compensation is based on the number of services provided\n* Associated with high overall health care costs\n* Discounted fee-for-service\n* A fixed payment schedule with discounted prices negotiated between health care providers and payers for each individual service\n* Often used by PPOs\n* Per diem payment (per day payment)\n* A fixed amount per patient per day paid to the health care provider for a specific care service provided, regardless of the actual costs involved in providing services for a particular patient.\n* Often used for reimbursement of inpatient services\n* The rates are typically stratified. A hospital can be paid different rates depending on the service provided (e.g., a hospital is paid a rate for a surgical day and a higher rate for a critical care unit day).\n* **Capitation**\n* Health care **practitioners** are compensated a **fixed amount** by the insurer during each payment period, regardless of the actual amount of health care services utilized by the patient.\n* Often used by HMOs\n* The payment period is usually monthly.\n* Incentivizes health care providers to deliver efficient care (e.g., cost-effective preventive health care to avoid larger downstream costs) \n* Carries the risk that patients will be undertreated because compensation is not based on the quantity or quality of services provided\n* **Global payment** \n* The insurer makes a **single**, **fixed payment** to a health care organization for the needs of a **population of patients** (i.e., enrollees in a health plan) during a specified time period (e.g., monthly or yearly) for expenses associated with an incident of care.\n* Usually paid to a single health care organization\n* Covers a wide range of services: typically includes physician fees, hospital services, tests, prescription drugs, and other services, such as follow-up visits\n* Often used for nonurgent surgery, with the coverage extending to all costs associated with the pre- and postoperative visits\n* Incentivizes health care providers to coordinate, deliver efficient care, and keep expenses low \n* Holds providers fully accountable for compensated services\n* **Bundled payment** \n* The insurer makes a **fixed payment** to a health care organization for **all** services provided for a **clinically-defined** **episode** of care (e.g., hip replacement, cholecystectomy).\n* The compensation is distributed among all health care providers involved in the care of the patient during that defined episode.\n* Incentivizes health care providers to deliver coordinated and efficient care (e.g., health care providers avoid unnecessary procedures, duplicate tests)\n* Typically based on the estimated cost of all of the services a patient would require during a single medical treatment episode or procedure\n* Example: a payment beginning 2 days prior to a knee replacement surgery and extending 30 days past a patient’s discharge from the hospital for this procedure \n* **Pay for performance** (P4P)\n* A payment model in which compensation depends on health care providers meeting certain metrics for the quality and efficiency of care provided\n* Calculated using specific measures of quality and by determining the overall health of populations\n* Providers are required to report specific metrics (e.g., safety, clinical care, efficiency and cost reduction, and patient and caregiver-centered experience) to payers and demonstrate improvement.\n* Providers typically track and report data on hospital readmissions, adverse events, population health, and patient engagement.\n* Improves value and quality of care by encouranging adherence to clinical guidelines and proven best practices (move from volume to value and better outcomes) through financial incentives\n* Motivates health care providers to protect and improve their reputation; improves accountability and transparency\n* Disadvantages\n* Reimbursement issues: Medicare penalizes hospitals with poor performance.\n* Payments are reduced by 2% and the funds are redistributed if the provider's performance or quality of care measures are unsatisfactory.\n* Hospitals with high readmission rates for specific episodes of care (i.e., myocardial infarction, heart failure, COPD, pneumonia) have their payments reduced by up to 3%.\n* Hospitals in the bottom quartile of performance based on nosocomial conditions with high readmission rates (e.g., CLABSI, CAUTI, surgical site infections, MRSA, C. difficile infections) have their payments reduced by 1%.\n* High administrative costs to gather data\n* Reduces access for socioeconomically disadvantaged patients: Health practitioners may not be incentivized to treat these patients, as they may have difficulty attending follow-ups and paying for treatment, which may lower performance on [P4P](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Np0-pS#Zbe811f74584ee59e119ec69dbd9aec47) measures.\n\n  \nUS Congress and state legislatures have implemented a number of policies in attempts to extend and guarantee access to health care.\n\n### Emergency medical treatment and labor act (EMTALA) \n\n* **Definition**: an act passed by Congress in 1986 that requires emergency departments to evaluate, treat, and stabilize patients presenting with emergency medical conditions (including [labor](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/3O0SHT#Z6ef73f19366e47d24a7b927f1f58d045)) regardless of the patient's ability to pay for the treatment provided\n* **Aims**\n* Ensure public access to emergency services\n* Reduce the incidence of patient dumping and inappropriate discharging\n* Prevent refusal to treat indigent patients\n* **Characteristics**\n* Hospitals cannot refuse emergency treatment for any reason, including age, sex, religious affiliation, or other characteristics.\n* Hospitals should not obtain prior authorization from the insurance company before screening or stabilizing a patient.\n* Hospitals can be held liable for injuries or deaths that result from refusing to admit or treat a patient.\n* **Disadvantages**\n* EMTALA has led to inappropriate use of the emergency department by uninsured patients and subsequent overcrowding.\n* Negatively affects the efficiency and type of services provided (e g., prolonged waiting times, stressful therapeutic environments, poor clinical outcomes)\n* Reimbursement issues \\[22\\]\n* Health plans deny or reduce payments, claiming:\n* Treatment was not medically necessary.\n* The individual did not have an emergency condition.\n* Treatment was provided at an out-of-network hospital.\n* The number of physicians willing to serve in emergency departments has declined due to uncompensated care.\n* Hospitals are closing emergency departments and are under increasing financial strain: Hospitals made up for uncompensated care by charging more for services for the insured. However, due to changes in the payment system, this is no longer possible.\n\n### Critical access hospital [23]\n\n* **Definition**: a designation created by Congress in 1997, through the Balanced Budget Act, that is assigned to small hospitals in rural areas by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in order to ensure and improve access to health care services\n* **Aims**\n* Improve access to health care services in rural areas\n* Reduce the financial vulnerability of hospitals in rural areas\n* **Characteristics**\n* Specific requirements must be met (e.g., ≤ 25 inpatient beds, located ≥ 35 mi or ≥ 56 km from another hospital, continuous emergency care services).\n* Each state decides how Medicaid reimbursements will be paid (e.g., pay-for-performance, fee-for-service).\n* Critical access hospitals need to maintain quality assurance and improvement with organizations or hospitals that are part of the network.\n* **Disadvantages**\n* Negatively affects the efficiency and type of services provided due to challenges in recruitment and retention of health care professionals\n* Reimbursement issues lead to financial insecurity for some hospitals.\n\n### Affordable care act (Obamacare) \n\n* **Definition**: a comprehensive health care reform law made by the US Congress in 2010 to ensure and expand affordable health care\n* **Aims**\n* Make health insurance affordable for more people, especially individuals who cannot afford it\n* Expansion of eligibility for Medicare\n* Support health care delivery models that lower the costs of health care\n* **Characteristics**\n* Individuals are required to have health insurance for a minimum of 9 months out of every year.\n* Dependent children are covered until they reach the age of 26.\n* It subsidizes the cost of health insurance for people who have income below the federal poverty level.\n* Individuals pay reduced copayments and deductibles.\n* Services such as preventive screenings, prescription drugs, laboratory tests, hospitalization, and outpatient, maternity, mental health, and rehabilitative services are included.\n* **Disadvantages**\n* Increased costs for insurance companies\n* Beneficiaries need to show proof of employment before being eligible for Medicaid.\n\n### Patient-centered medical home\n\n* **Definition**: a health care delivery model that provides comprehensive advanced primary care coordinated through the individual's primary care physician\n* **Aims**\n* Facilitate patient and physician partnership\n* Patients receive necessary treatment at the time and place they need it\n* Improve quality and experience for patients and health care providers\n* Lower medical costs\n* **Characteristics**\n* Patient-centered approach\n* The primary care physician is the first point of contact.\n* A multidisciplinary health care team is assembled according to the patient's need\n* Based on five core functions\n* Accessibility and continuity of services\n* Comprehensive and coordinated care\n* Patient and caregiver satisfaction\n* High-quality care and patient safety\n* Planned care and population health management\n* **Disadvantages**\n* Not enough data to assess effectiveness\n* Not enough payers currently adopting this model\n* Evidence on cost is mixed.",

    "text": "Megathread #66: SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 discussion. 12/52021 COVID-19 Megathread #66\n\nThis is a megathread to consolidate discussion about the COVID-19 outbreak. This thread is a place for discussion, personal anecdotes of providing COVID care, brief updates, and professional questions about the epidemiology and management of COVID-19. Reputable sources (not unverified twitter posts!) are still requested to support any new claims about the outbreak.\n\nWe will be hosting a new megathread periodically depending on developments/content. The latest thread will always be stickied and will provide the most up-to-date information. If you just posted something in the previous thread right before it got unstickied and your question wasn't answered/your point wasn't discussed, feel free to repost it in the latest one. If the active COVID megathread isn't stickied, please notify the moderators [by modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/medicine) with a link to the thread.\n\n# Background and summary\n\n On December 31st 2019, Chinese authorities reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. A novel zoonotic virus was suspected and discovered, now named SARS-CoV-2. The syndrome of viral pneumonia caused by this virus -- sometimes associated with abnormal coagulation parameters, anosmia, anorexia, renal failure, and/or gastrointestinal distress -- has been termed COVID-19.\n\nDespite extreme public health interventions at the first epicenter in Hubei province, China, the outbreak has become a global pandemic. Several factors have made for explosive spread of SARS-CoV-2: the human population is immunologically naive, the virus has a long incubation period and can be asymptomatically spread, and is highly infectious, with an rate of transmission significantly higher than epidemic influenza. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has proven deadly as well, with case fatality rate (CFR) estimates ranging between 0.1 to 1% or more. To date, at least 652,000 people have lost their lives in a confirmed case of COVID-19 since December 2019. The true number is suspected to be higher.\n\nThe effect of the pandemic on the healthcare system has been extreme, with cases overwhelming normal operations of hospitals during the initial surge in a number of regions, leading to staff exposure, illness, and in some cases, death. This was exacerbated by worldwide shortages in medical equipment, particularly personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers; shortages are still present in many parts of the world including the United States. Rationing of healthcare resources has been widely discussed, and in some areas implemented, creating agonizing decisions for doctors and families.\n\nHealthcare organizations have also been starved of usual revenue, and despite an overwhelming demand for healthcare in some specialties and regions, other medical practices are seeing massive drops in income. Furloughs and pay cuts are becoming common across the American medical landscape. Telehealth visits are becoming common, and practices inside the hospital in many regions have completely transformed. In dense cities that have been handling an onslaught of patients for months, many frontline staff (ER, general medicine, ICU, etc.) are physically and emotionally fatigued, yet still face a hazardous working environment.\n\nAlthough some regions of the United States, Europe and Asia have been able to control the spread of COVID-19 with combinations of business shutdowns, shelter-in-place/quarantine orders, mandatory mask usage, and social distancing protocols, spread has accelerated in other regions of the United States, Brazil, Russia, and India among other areas. Public health interventions remain controversial in many areas, and particularly in the United States, have become politicized and rejected by many.\n\nMedical science has struggled to keep pace with the spread of the virus. Despite a number of hastily executed clinical trials, few agents have been found to have any clinical effect on COVID-19 outcomes. Misinformation and partial information (such as leaks of interim clinical trial data) are rife. Clinical treatment algorithms have swung wildly based on small case series, anecdotes and conjecture, though a rough consensus for critical supportive care has gradually coalesced. Virologists, immunologists, and others have pivoted their usual research and an impressive number of preprints have been generated. However, enormous questions remain, such as the nature of post-infectious immunity.\n\nThe newest battleground in this seemingly never-ending fight is convincing a skeptical public that vaccination is the only way to make progress towards returning to life as we all knew it before this situation began eighteen months ago. Misinformation is rife within the realm of popular social networks, including reddit. Vaccination rate has stalled across most of the globe after those most motivated to receive it have finally been inoculated. As of this posting, across the globe the current fear is of a new wave of omicron variant cases even as delta variant never fully died down.\n\n# Subreddits:\n\n* [r/medicinememorial - memorial pages for health care workers who died in the global fight against COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicinememorial/)\n* [r/Coronavirus - general news and discussion about the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/)\n* [r/COVID19 - academic papers and press releases relating to COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/)\n\n# Tracking/Maps/Modeling:\n\n* [JHU CSSE](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)\n* [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)\n* [Worldometer case tracker](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)\n* [Coronawiki case tracker](https://www.coronawiki.org/)\n* [New York Times case tracker and map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)\n* [BNO News case tracker and map](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/04/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)\n* [Wikipedia COVID-19 information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)\n* [CDC death forecasts](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html)\n* [IHME projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america)\n* [University of Texas Modeling Consortium](https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/projections/)\n\n# Resources from Organizational Bodies\n\n* [WHO Daily Sitreps](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports)\n* [ECDC Latest](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china)\n* [USA CDC Latest](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\n* [Promed](https://promedmail.org/coronavirus/)\n* [Imperial MRC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)\n* [CDC Info for health professionals](https://bit.ly/2T80VBd)\n* [LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/research-action/covid-19)\n* [WHO Technical Guidance](https://bit.ly/2vo9DSM)\n* [AMA resource center for health professionals](https://bit.ly/395aNkO)\n* [ACP Information for Internists](https://bit.ly/2T99Rqc)\n* [CDC Pandemic Preparedness Resources](https://bit.ly/2whQmCU)\n* [UpToDate COVID-19](https://bit.ly/2Tphyam)\n* [EMCrit](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/COVID19/)\n* [SCCM](https://www.sccm.org/covid19)\n* [RCoA/ICS](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/)\n* [Intensive Blog](https://intensiveblog.com/covid-19/)\n* [NICE Guidance](https://www.nice.org.uk/covid-19)\n* [ICU Net](https://covid19-icu.net/)\n* [EMRAP](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/rec906m1mD6SRH9np/Novel-Coronavirus-2019-COVID-19?SearchType=%22text%22)\n\n# Reminders\n\nThis subreddit is heavily moderated and comments may be removed without warning.

    "text": "Megathread #57: SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Month of January 2021. COVID-19 Megathread #56\n\nThis is a megathread to consolidate discussion about the COVID-19 outbreak. This thread is a place for discussion, personal anecdotes of providing COVID care, brief updates, and professional questions about the epidemiology and management of COVID-19. Reputable sources (not unverified twitter posts!) are still requested to support any new claims about the outbreak.\n\nWe will be hosting a new megathread periodically depending on developments/content. The latest thread will always be stickied and will provide the most up-to-date information. If you just posted something in the previous thread right before it got unstickied and your question wasn't answered/your point wasn't discussed, feel free to repost it in the latest one. If the active COVID megathread isn't stickied, please notify the moderators [by modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/medicine) with a link to the thread.\n\n# Background and summary\n\nOn December 31st 2019, Chinese authorities reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. A novel zoonotic virus was suspected and discovered, now named SARS-CoV-2. The syndrome of viral pneumonia caused by this virus -- sometimes associated with abnormal coagulation parameters, anosmia, anorexia, renal failure, and/or gastrointestinal distress -- has been termed COVID-19.\n\nDespite extreme public health interventions at the first epicenter in Hubei province, China, the outbreak has become a global pandemic. Several factors have made for explosive spread of SARS-CoV-2: the human population is immunologically naive, the virus has a long incubation period and can be asymptomatically spread, and is highly infectious, with an rate of transmission significantly higher than epidemic influenza. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has proven deadly as well, with case fatality rate (CFR) estimates ranging between 0.1 to 1% or more. To date, an estimated 63 million people have been infected and some 1.5 million people have lost their lives in a confirmed case of COVID-19 since December 2019. The true numbers are suspected to be higher.\n\nThe effect of the pandemic on the healthcare system has been extreme, with cases overwhelming normal operations of hospitals during the initial surge in a number of regions, leading to staff exposure, illness, and in some cases, death. This was exacerbated by worldwide shortages in medical equipment, particularly personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers; shortages are still present in many parts of the world including the United States. Rationing of healthcare resources has been widely discussed, and in some areas implemented, creating agonizing decisions for doctors and families.\n\nHealthcare organizations have also been starved of usual revenue, and despite an overwhelming demand for healthcare in some specialties and regions, other medical practices are seeing massive drops in income. Furloughs and pay cuts are becoming common across the American medical landscape. Telehealth visits are becoming common, and practices inside the hospital in many regions have completely transformed. In dense cities that have been handling an onslaught of patients for months, many frontline staff (ER, general medicine, ICU, etc) are physically and emotionally fatigued, yet still face a hazardous working environment.\n\nAlthough some regions of the United States, Europe and Asia have been able to control the spread of COVID-19 with combinations of business shutdowns, shelter-in-place/quarantine orders, mandatory mask usage, and social distancing protocols, spread has accelerated in other regions of the United States, Brazil, Russia, and India among other areas. Public health interventions remain controversial in many areas, and particularly in the United States, have become politicized and rejected by many.\n\nMedical science has struggled to keep pace with the spread of the virus. Despite a number of hastily executed clinical trials, few agents have been found to have any clinical effect on COVID-19 outcomes. Dexamethasone has emerged as the only treatment so far with a [demonstrated mortality benefit](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/low-cost-dexamethasone-reduces-death-by-up-to-one-third-in-hospitalised-patients-with-severe-respiratory-complications-of-covid-19) in patients requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilator support. Misinformation and partial information (such as leaks of interim clinical trial data) are rife. Clinical treatment algorithms have swung wildly based on small case series, anecdotes and conjecture, though a shaky consensus for critical supportive care is starting to emerge. Virologists, immunologists, and others have pivoted their usual research and an impressive number of preprints have been generated. However, enormous questions remain, such as the nature of post-infectious immunity.\n\nAs of December, several vaccines across the world have received emergency use authorization, and vaccination has begun.\n\n# Subreddits:\n\n* [r/medicinememorial - memorial pages for health care workers who died in the global fight against COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicinememorial/)\n* [r/Coronavirus - general news and discussion about the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/)\n* [r/COVID19 - academic papers and press releases relating to COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/)\n\n# Tracking/Maps/Modeling:\n\n* [JHU CSSE](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)\n* [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)\n* [Worldometer case tracker](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)\n* [Coronawiki case tracker](https://www.coronawiki.org/)\n* [New York Times case tracker and map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)\n* [BNO News case tracker and map](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/04/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)\n* [Wikipedia COVID-19 information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)\n* [CDC death forecasts](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html)\n* [IHME projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america)\n* [University of Texas Modeling Consortium](https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/projections/)\n\n# Resources from Organizational Bodies\n\n* [WHO Daily Sitreps](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports)\n* [ECDC Latest](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china)\n* [USA CDC Latest](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\n* [Promed](https://promedmail.org/coronavirus/)\n* [Imperial MRC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)\n* [CDC Info for health professionals](https://bit.ly/2T80VBd)\n* [LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/research-action/covid-19)\n* [WHO Technical Guidance](https://bit.ly/2vo9DSM)\n* [AMA resource center for health professionals](https://bit.ly/395aNkO)\n* [ACP Information for Internists](https://bit.ly/2T99Rqc)\n* [CDC Pandemic Preparedness Resources](https://bit.ly/2whQmCU)\n* [UpToDate COVID-19](https://bit.ly/2Tphyam)\n* [EMCrit](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/COVID19/)\n* [SCCM](https://www.sccm.org/covid19)\n* [RCoA/ICS](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/)\n* [Intensive Blog](https://intensiveblog.com/covid-19/)\n* [NICE Guidance](https://www.nice.org.uk/covid-19)\n* [ICU Net](https://covid19-icu.net/)\n* [EMRAP](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/rec906m1mD6SRH9np/Novel-Coronavirus-2019-COVID-19?SearchType=%22text%22)\n\n# Reminders\n\nThis subreddit is heavily moderated and comments may be removed without warning.

Misinformation is rife within the realm of popular social networks, including reddit. Vaccination rate has stalled across most of the globe after those most motivated to receive it have finally been inoculated. Although there has been an uptick in number of shots administered since the beginning of this third wave in June, the rate remains insufficient to dampen the current curve of infection.\n\n# Subreddits:\n\n* [r/medicinememorial - memorial pages for health care workers who died in the global fight against COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicinememorial/)\n\n* [r/Coronavirus - general news and discussion about the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/)\n\n* [r/COVID19 - academic papers and press releases relating to COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/)\n\n# Tracking/Maps/Modeling:\n\n* [JHU CSSE](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)\n\n* [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)\n\n* [Worldometer case tracker](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)\n\n* [Coronawiki case tracker](https://www.coronawiki.org/)\n\n* [New York Times case tracker and map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)\n\n* [BNO News case tracker and map](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/04/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)\n\n* [Wikipedia COVID-19 information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)\n\n* [CDC death forecasts](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html)\n\n* [IHME projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america)\n\n* [University of Texas Modeling Consortium](https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/projections/)\n\n# Resources from Organisational Bodies\n\n* [WHO Daily Sitreps](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports)\n\n* [ECDC Latest](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china)\n\n* [USA CDC Latest](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\n\n* [Promed](https://promedmail.org/coronavirus/)\n\n* [Imperial MRC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)\n\n* [CDC Info for health professionals](https://bit.ly/2T80VBd)\n\n* [LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/research-action/covid-19)\n\n* [WHO Technical Guidance](https://bit.ly/2vo9DSM)\n\n* [AMA resource center for health professionals](https://bit.ly/395aNkO)\n\n* [ACP Information for Internists](https://bit.ly/2T99Rqc)\n\n* [CDC Pandemic Preparedness Resources](https://bit.ly/2whQmCU)\n\n* [UpToDate COVID-19](https://bit.ly/2Tphyam)\n\n* [EMCrit](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/COVID19/)\n\n* [SCCM](https://www.sccm.org/covid19)\n\n* [RCoA/ICS](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/)\n\n* [Intensive Blog](https://intensiveblog.com/covid-19/)\n\n* [NICE Guidance](https://www.nice.org.uk/covid-19)\n\n* [ICU Net](https://covid19-icu.net/)\n\n* [EMRAP](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/rec906m1mD6SRH9np/Novel-Coronavirus-2019-COVID-19?SearchType=%22text%22)\n\n# Reminders\n\nThis subreddit is heavily moderated and comments may be removed without warning.

    "text": "Megathread #59: SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Month of March 2021. # COVID-19 Megathread 59\n\nThis is a megathread to consolidate discussion about the COVID-19 outbreak. This thread is a place for discussion, personal anecdotes of providing COVID care, brief updates, and professional questions about the epidemiology and management of COVID-19. Reputable sources (not unverified twitter posts!) are still requested to support any new claims about the outbreak.\n\nWe will be hosting a new megathread periodically depending on developments/content. The latest thread will always be stacked and will provide the most up-to-date information. If you just posted something in the previous thread right before it got unstickied and your question wasn't answered/your point wasn't discussed, feel free to repost it in the latest one.\n\n# Background and summary\n\nOn December 31st 2019, Chinese authorities reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. A novel zoonotic virus was suspected and discovered, now named SARS-CoV-2. The syndrome of viral pneumonia caused by this virus -- sometimes associated with abnormal coagulation parameters, anosmia, anorexia, renal failure, and/or gastrointestinal distress -- has been termed COVID-19.\n\nDespite extreme public health interventions at the first epicenter in Hubei province, China, the outbreak has become a global pandemic. Several factors have made for explosive spread of SARS-CoV-2: the human population is immunologically naive, the virus has a long incubation period and can be asymptomatically spread, and is highly infectious, with an rate of transmission significantly higher than epidemic influenza. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has proven deadly as well, with case fatality rate (CFR) estimates ranging between 0.1 to 1% or more. To date, at least 652,000 people have lost their lives in a confirmed case of COVID-19 since December 2019. The true number is suspected to be higher.\n\nThe effect of the pandemic on the healthcare system has been extreme, with cases overwhelming normal operations of hospitals during the initial surge in a number of regions, leading to staff exposure, illness, and in some cases, death. This was exacerbated by worldwide shortages in medical equipment, particularly personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers; shortages are still present in many parts of the world including the United States. Rationing of healthcare resources has been widely discussed, and in some areas implemented, creating agonizing decisions for doctors and families.\n\nHealthcare organizations have also been starved of usual revenue, and despite an overwhelming demand for healthcare in some specialties and regions, other medical practices are seeing massive drops in income. Furloughs and pay cuts are becoming common across the American medical landscape. Telehealth visits are becoming common, and practices inside the hospital in many regions have completely transformed. In dense cities that have been handling an onslaught of patients for months, many frontline staff (ER, general medicine, ICU, etc) are physically and emotionally fatigued, yet still face a hazardous working environment.\n\nAlthough some regions of the United States, Europe and Asia have been able to control the spread of COVID-19 with combinations of business shutdowns, shelter-in-place/quarantine orders, mandatory mask usage, and social distancing protocols, spread has accelerated in other regions of the United States, Brazil, Russia, and India among other areas. Public health interventions remain controversial in many areas, and particularly in the United States, have become politicized and rejected by many.\n\nMedical science has struggled to keep pace with the spread of the virus. Despite a number of hastily executed clinical trials, few agents have been found to have any clinical effect on COVID-19 outcomes. Dexamethasone has emerged as the only treatment so far with a [demonstrated mortality benefit](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/low-cost-dexamethasone-reduces-death-by-up-to-one-third-in-hospitalised-patients-with-severe-respiratory-complications-of-covid-19) in patients requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilator support. Misinformation and partial information (such as leaks of interim clinical trial data) are rife. Clinical treatment algorithms have swung wildly based on small case series, anecdotes and conjecture, though a shaky consensus for critical supportive care is starting to emerge. Virologists, immunologists, and others have pivoted their usual research and an impressive number of preprints have been generated. However, enormous questions remain, such as the nature of post-infectious immunity.\n\n# Subreddits:\n\n* [r/medicinememorial - memorial pages for health care workers who died in the global fight against COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicinememorial/)\n\n* [r/Coronavirus - general news and discussion about the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/)\n\n* [r/COVID19 - academic papers and press releases relating to COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/)\n\n# Tracking/Maps/Modeling:\n\n* [JHU CSSE](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)\n\n* [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)\n\n* [Worldometer case tracker](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)\n\n* [Coronawiki case tracker](https://www.coronawiki.org/)\n\n* [New York Times case tracker and map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)\n\n* [BNO News case tracker and map](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/04/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)\n\n* [Wikipedia COVID-19 information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)\n\n* [CDC death forecasts](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html)\n\n* [IHME projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america)\n\n* [University of Texas Modeling Consortium](https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/projections/)\n\n# Resources from Organisational Bodies\n\n* [WHO Daily Sitreps](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports)\n\n* [ECDC Latest](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china)\n\n* [USA CDC Latest](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\n\n* [Promed](https://promedmail.org/coronavirus/)\n\n* [Imperial MRC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)\n\n* [CDC Info for health professionals](https://bit.ly/2T80VBd)\n\n* [LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/research-action/covid-19)\n\n* [WHO Technical Guidance](https://bit.ly/2vo9DSM)\n\n* [AMA resource center for health professionals](https://bit.ly/395aNkO)\n\n* [ACP Information for Internists](https://bit.ly/2T99Rqc)\n\n* [CDC Pandemic Preparedness Resources](https://bit.ly/2whQmCU)\n\n* [UpToDate COVID-19](https://bit.ly/2Tphyam)\n\n* [EMCrit](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/COVID19/)\n\n* [SCCM](https://www.sccm.org/covid19)\n\n* [RCoA/ICS](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/)\n\n* [Intensive Blog](https://intensiveblog.com/covid-19/)\n\n* [NICE Guidance](https://www.nice.org.uk/covid-19)\n\n* [ICU Net](https://covid19-icu.net/)\n\n* [EMRAP](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/rec906m1mD6SRH9np/Novel-Coronavirus-2019-COVID-19?SearchType=%22text%22)\n\n# Reminders\n\nThis subreddit is heavily moderated and comments may be removed without warning.

Several virus variants have appeared around the globe with concern for increased infectious spread and risk that they will render vaccines ineffective before they have even been rolled out widely.\n\n# Subreddits:\n\n* [r/medicinememorial - memorial pages for health care workers who died in the global fight against COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicinememorial/)\n* [r/Coronavirus - general news and discussion about the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/)\n* [r/COVID19 - academic papers and press releases relating to COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/)\n\n# Tracking/Maps/Modeling:\n\n* [JHU CSSE](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)\n* [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)\n* [Worldometer case tracker](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)\n* [Coronawiki case tracker](https://www.coronawiki.org/)\n* [New York Times case tracker and map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)\n* [BNO News case tracker and map](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/04/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)\n* [Wikipedia COVID-19 information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)\n* [CDC death forecasts](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html)\n* [IHME projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america)\n* [University of Texas Modeling Consortium](https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/projections/)\n\n# Resources from Organizational Bodies\n\n* [WHO Daily Sitreps](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports)\n* [ECDC Latest](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china)\n* [USA CDC Latest](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\n* [Promed](https://promedmail.org/coronavirus/)\n* [Imperial MRC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)\n* [CDC Info for health professionals](https://bit.ly/2T80VBd)\n* [LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/research-action/covid-19)\n* [WHO Technical Guidance](https://bit.ly/2vo9DSM)\n* [AMA resource center for health professionals](https://bit.ly/395aNkO)\n* [ACP Information for Internists](https://bit.ly/2T99Rqc)\n* [CDC Pandemic Preparedness Resources](https://bit.ly/2whQmCU)\n* [UpToDate COVID-19](https://bit.ly/2Tphyam)\n* [EMCrit](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/COVID19/)\n* [SCCM](https://www.sccm.org/covid19)\n* [RCoA/ICS](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/)\n* [Intensive Blog](https://intensiveblog.com/covid-19/)\n* [NICE Guidance](https://www.nice.org.uk/covid-19)\n* [ICU Net](https://covid19-icu.net/)\n* [EMRAP](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/rec906m1mD6SRH9np/Novel-Coronavirus-2019-COVID-19?SearchType=%22text%22)\n\n# Reminders\n\nThis subreddit is heavily moderated and comments may be removed without warning.

This thread is a place for discussion, personal anecdotes of providing COVID care, brief updates, and professional questions about the epidemiology and management of COVID-19. Reputable sources (not unverified twitter posts!) are still requested to support any new claims about the outbreak.\n\nWe will be hosting a new megathread periodically depending on developments/content.

A novel zoonotic virus was suspected and discovered, now named SARS-CoV-2. The syndrome of viral pneumonia caused by this virus -- sometimes associated with abnormal coagulation parameters, anosmia, anorexia, renal failure, and/or gastrointestinal distress -- has been termed COVID-19.\n\nDespite extreme public health interventions at the first epicenter in Hubei province, China, the outbreak has become a global pandemic. Several factors have made for explosive spread of SARS-CoV-2: the human population is immunologically naive, the virus has a long incubation period and can be asymptomatically spread, and is highly infectious, with an rate of transmission significantly higher than epidemic influenza. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has proven deadly as well, with case fatality rate (CFR) estimates ranging between 0.1 to 1% or more. As of April 2021, an estimated 140 million people have been infected and some 3 million people have lost their lives in a confirmed case of COVID-19 since December 2019. The true numbers are suspected to be higher.\n\nThe effect of the pandemic on the healthcare system has been extreme, with cases overwhelming normal operations of hospitals during the initial surge in a number of regions, leading to staff exposure, illness, and in some cases, death. This was exacerbated by worldwide shortages in medical equipment, particularly personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers; shortages are still present in many parts of the world including the United States. Rationing of healthcare resources has been widely discussed, and in some areas implemented, creating agonizing decisions for doctors and families.\n\nHealthcare organizations have also been starved of usual revenue, and despite an overwhelming demand for healthcare in some specialties and regions, other medical practices are seeing massive drops in income. Furloughs and pay cuts are becoming common across the American medical landscape. Telehealth visits are becoming common, and practices inside the hospital in many regions have completely transformed. In dense cities that have been handling an onslaught of patients for months, many frontline staff (ER, general medicine, ICU, etc) are physically and emotionally fatigued, yet still face a hazardous working environment.\n\nAlthough some regions of the United States, Europe and Asia have been able to control the spread of COVID-19 with combinations of business shutdowns, shelter-in-place/quarantine orders, mandatory mask usage, and social distancing protocols, spread has accelerated in other regions of the United States, Brazil, Russia, and India among other areas. Public health interventions remain controversial in many areas, and particularly in the United States, have become politicized and rejected by many.\n\n# Subreddits:\n\n* [r/medicinememorial - memorial pages for health care workers who died in the global fight against COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicinememorial/)\n* [r/Coronavirus - general news and discussion about the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/)\n* [r/COVID19 - academic papers and press releases relating to COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/)\n\n# Tracking/Maps/Modeling:\n\n* [JHU CSSE](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)\n* [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)\n* [Worldometer case tracker](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)\n* [Coronawiki case tracker](https://www.coronawiki.org/)\n* [New York Times case tracker and map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)\n* [BNO News case tracker and map](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/04/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)\n* [Wikipedia COVID-19 information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)\n* [CDC death forecasts](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html)\n* [IHME projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america)\n* [University of Texas Modeling Consortium](https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/projections/)\n\n# Resources from Organizational Bodies\n\n* [WHO Daily Sitreps](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports)\n* [ECDC Latest](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china)\n* [USA CDC Latest](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\n* [Promed](https://promedmail.org/coronavirus/)\n* [Imperial MRC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)\n* [CDC Info for health professionals](https://bit.ly/2T80VBd)\n* [LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/research-action/covid-19)\n* [WHO Technical Guidance](https://bit.ly/2vo9DSM)\n* [AMA resource center for health professionals](https://bit.ly/395aNkO)\n* [ACP Information for Internists](https://bit.ly/2T99Rqc)\n* [CDC Pandemic Preparedness Resources](https://bit.ly/2whQmCU)\n* [UpToDate COVID-19](https://bit.ly/2Tphyam)\n* [EMCrit](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/COVID19/)\n* [SCCM](https://www.sccm.org/covid19)\n* [RCoA/ICS](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/)\n* [Intensive Blog](https://intensiveblog.com/covid-19/)\n* [NICE Guidance](https://www.nice.org.uk/covid-19)\n* [ICU Net](https://covid19-icu.net/)\n* [EMRAP](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/rec906m1mD6SRH9np/Novel-Coronavirus-2019-COVID-19?SearchType=%22text%22)\n\n# Reminders\n\nThis subreddit is heavily moderated and comments may be removed without warning.

Unfortunately, COVID-19 has proven deadly as well, with case fatality rate (CFR) estimates ranging between 0.1 to 1% or more.

Public health interventions remain controversial in many areas, and particularly in the United States, have become politicized and rejected by many.\n\nMedical science has struggled to keep pace with the spread of the virus. Despite a number of hastily executed clinical trials, few agents have been found to have any clinical effect on COVID-19 outcomes. Dexamethasone has emerged as the only treatment so far with a [demonstrated mortality benefit](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/low-cost-dexamethasone-reduces-death-by-up-to-one-third-in-hospitalised-patients-with-severe-respiratory-complications-of-covid-19) in patients requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilator support. Misinformation and partial information (such as leaks of interim clinical trial data) are rife. Clinical treatment algorithms have swung wildly based on small case series, anecdotes and conjecture, though a shaky consensus for critical supportive care is starting to emerge. Virologists, immunologists, and others have pivoted their usual research and an impressive number of preprints have been generated. However, enormous questions remain, such as the nature of post-infectious immunity.\n\n# Subreddits:\n\n* [r/medicinememorial - memorial pages for health care workers who died in the global fight against COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicinememorial/)\n\n* [r/Coronavirus - general news and discussion about the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/)\n\n* [r/COVID19 - academic papers and press releases relating to COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/)\n\n# Tracking/Maps/Modeling:\n\n* [JHU CSSE](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)\n\n* [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)\n\n* [Worldometer case tracker](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)\n\n* [Coronawiki case tracker](https://www.coronawiki.org/)\n\n* [New York Times case tracker and map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)\n\n* [BNO News case tracker and map](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/04/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)\n\n* [Wikipedia COVID-19 information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)\n\n* [CDC death forecasts](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html)\n\n* [IHME projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america)\n\n* [University of Texas Modeling Consortium](https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/projections/)\n\n# Resources from Organisational Bodies\n\n* [WHO Daily Sitreps](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports)\n\n* [ECDC Latest](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china)\n\n* [USA CDC Latest](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\n\n* [Promed](https://promedmail.org/coronavirus/)\n\n* [Imperial MRC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)\n\n* [CDC Info for health professionals](https://bit.ly/2T80VBd)\n\n* [LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/research-action/covid-19)\n\n* [WHO Technical Guidance](https://bit.ly/2vo9DSM)\n\n* [AMA resource center for health professionals](https://bit.ly/395aNkO)\n\n* [ACP Information for Internists](https://bit.ly/2T99Rqc)\n\n* [CDC Pandemic Preparedness Resources](https://bit.ly/2whQmCU)\n\n* [UpToDate COVID-19](https://bit.ly/2Tphyam)\n\n* [EMCrit](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/COVID19/)\n\n* [SCCM](https://www.sccm.org/covid19)\n\n* [RCoA/ICS](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/)\n\n* [Intensive Blog](https://intensiveblog.com/covid-19/)\n\n* [NICE Guidance](https://www.nice.org.uk/covid-19)\n\n* [ICU Net](https://covid19-icu.net/)\n\n* [EMRAP](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/rec906m1mD6SRH9np/Novel-Coronavirus-2019-COVID-19?SearchType=%22text%22)\n\n# Reminders\n\nThis subreddit is heavily moderated and comments may be removed without warning.

No ability to vote. No eligibility for Medicare/ Medicaid. No eligibility for disability. No eligibility for SSI. \nNo guarantee to leave and travel outside the country.  Undocumented immigrants  face barriers in homeownership, auto loans, purchasing stocks, retirement and employment...yet no pathway for citizenship. I have lived 28 out of my 29 years here, I know no other home. \n\nI owe my license to my hardwork and determination; it took so much to get to where I am. I walked to school and work, when I didn't have a car. I worked 50 hours a week, and managed to take 16 course and  lab hours a semester of prerequisites. Somehow I graduated. Now Im a homeowner. I am debt free from car or student loans.  Im active in volunteering for my community. I donate to several charities because I believe in giving back. Im a law abiding citizen. I am an exemplary and outstanding representation of a citizen...yet I'm seen as vermin to Republicans and many other Americans. \n\nI was on the frontlines of COVID. I stepped up during a time of uncertainty when many nurses and physicians refused to work COVID (before vaccines) in fear of contracting it or bringing it home.  I held the hands of dying Americans while desperately trying to reach family via an iPad. I did compressions on expecting mothers. I slept in the hospital for a week because we couldn't afford to lose staff because of the freezing weather here in Texas this past February. \nI brought many Americans down to the basement...knowing I was one of the last people they saw alive. I was called a Hero. I was called brave. I was called an essential worker. In the context of my immigration status,  I suddenly become neither.\nI am a Dreamer who's going on 29 years of dreaming of change....now I realize maybe it's time to give up hope.\n\n1. Yes I'm a DACA recipient. Look up DACA if your unfamiliar.  \nI have a social security number,  legal work authorization,  deferred action against deportation, and I renew every 2 years and get a background check during renewal. \n\n2. Majority of states allow DACA recipients to hold professional licensure. It varies tremendously but we are attorneys, physicians, engineers, teachers, social workers, and yes...even nurses. \n\n3. There is NO pathway. The argument to do it \"LEGALLY\" is mute when you have no port of entry, an American spouse, non-qualified feild of employment sponsorship,  or qualify for asylum. I think I would have already done something about it if the current immigration laws allowed myself to apply. Its not an issue about applying and waiting , it's there are no current avenues. \n\n4. Nurses don't qualify for employment sponsorship (H1B visas) .  That might change one day. Given that some of our non-science believing and non-empathetic coworkers will find themselves without jobs here shortly. \n\n5. I haven't gotten married for the sake of getting a greencard.  To add to the complexity of my life, I am Gay and dating in Central Texas I have very limited options. That's an entire separate issue.",

    "text": "We need to talk about the crisis in home care and home nursing. I am not a nurse, so I hope it's OK for me to start this thread -- it affects nurses, CNAs, HHAs, DSPs, and other caregivers, but is not being talked about much here or anywhere else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR: Wages for home care workers are abysmal, fast food now pays better, and people with disabilities are struggling to find caregivers because they are on Medicaid and have no power to raise wages for those who assist them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are currently experiencing a crisis in home care. In my area, home care agencies can't get workers. They are paying $11-$14 per hour while fast food is paying $14-$16 per hour. They are so desperate, they are hiring almost anyone. They also aren’t requiring workers to get vaccinated, even though they should be because most of their clients are on Medicare and/or Medicaid. Most have waiting lists for new clients to receive care because they are short-staffed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLow wages are also a huge problem in home nursing, and many people who need nurses can't get care. Here's an article about it from Indiana: [https://www.wthr.com/article/news/investigations/13-investigates/13-investigates-indiana-families-denied-millions-of-hours-of-home-nursing-care-fssa-indianapolis-holcomb-respite/531-bea3a75c-ba6b-4184-bcc2-6f717bef9d7a](https://www.wthr.com/article/news/investigations/13-investigates/13-investigates-indiana-families-denied-millions-of-hours-of-home-nursing-care-fssa-indianapolis-holcomb-respite/531-bea3a75c-ba6b-4184-bcc2-6f717bef9d7a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven fewer people know about the crisis currently facing people with disabilities who are in Medicaid waiver consumer-directed care programs. I am one such person. With consumer directed care programs, the person with a disability, or a designated representative, hires and manages their own home aides and the state pays them through a fiscal intermediary (kind of like a payroll system if payroll systems had slow enrollment, shitty customer service, and constantly messed up payments to employees). Consumer-directed programs are great in theory, because they preserve our right to choose who helps us, when, and how, and we can live in our own homes, go shopping, travel, work (in some cases) and live a pretty \"normal\" life. IF the programs worked the way they are designed to work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem is that even though people with disabilities have the right to manage our own caregivers, we have no control over how much they get paid per hour in every state except for Colorado (and yes, I'm trying to move there). Wages are set by the state (or county in a few places such as California), and don’t keep up with the cost of living at all, let alone the new prevailing wages for workers. My state, Indiana, paid $9.35 per hour until mid-2020, when it was raised to $12.86 per hour. Oh gee. How exactly am I (or any person with a disability or their loved one) supposed to find someone who will do tasks like lifting someone on and off the toilet, bathing, dressing, cleaning, cooking and other personal care and household tasks for that pay rate? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn many states, the person can also have non-certified caregivers do tasks that would typically require a nurse, such as ventilator management, wound care, ostomy bag changing, etc. for the same shit pay. There's also no pay rate consideration for circumstances that might make the job extra difficult, for example, caring for someone with a developmental disability who has violent outbursts. Many states and programs are using invasive EVV (electronic visit verification) that GPS tracks caregivers and treats caregivers and clients like criminals on an ankle monitor, going against the principles of Independent Living and violating people's freedom to live and travel in their communities. All of these factors make caregiving an unappealing job, especially now that fast food and retail pay the same or better for far less effort. It has always been hard to find workers, but now we are at a breaking point. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany people with disabilities I know are short on care. They are going without bathing, developing pressure sores, not eating well, etc. because they have no one to help them. Most states won’t let you hire someone with a serious criminal record, but in the few where it’s allowed, people are hiring those they wouldn’t normally be comfortable with because they’re desperate. They are hiring unvaccinated people because they can’t find anyone else. They are putting up with being abused or neglected because it's better than having no care at all. Some are ending up in nursing homes where they are dying of COVID and other infections. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're disabled and need care at home right now, you're fucked if you don’t have some way of paying extra -- and many people don’t, because these are Medicaid-based programs and although there are a few ways to qualify with more income, in general, those receiving care are very poor. Those of us who have managed to keep aides have mostly done it because we supplement the wage somehow, usually via a family member or medical expenses trust. Or people fudge the hours by having caregivers claim more hours than they actually worked to get more pay, but of course if anyone finds out, they could get in trouble. Plus that still means having fewer hours of help. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a person who values my bodily autonomy and appreciates those who help me stay independent, it makes me angry that the state thinks my aides only deserve $12.86/hour. I’ve managed to work it out so I can supplement to where they get $16-$17 per hour, but it’s a balancing act and it's taking a financial toll. Most people with disabilities CANNOT do this because they don't have the financial means. This issue is also not being discussed within the larger context of The Great Resignation and the antiwork and new labor movements. I support the fight for fair wages and people refusing to take jobs where they are under-paid and under-valued. But people need to understand that in this industry, wages are severely limited by low reimbursement rates from Medicaid, and the people who need care and in some cases act as the employer have NO ability to pay more or solve the problems -- no matter how much we want to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what can we as Americans do about this? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Build Back Better act would provide considerable funding for disability services, including addressing low wages in these programs and ending waiting lists that mean many people who qualify for care don’t even receive it right now. When people are debating that law, they are debating my life, and the lives of the people who care for those with disabilities and senior citizens. Frankly, these services need to be included in a Medicare for All/All Who Want It law, but at least Build Back Better would be a start. So please support it for your fellow care workers and home nurses who are currently underpaid by Medicaid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can also advocate for higher reimbursement rates on the state level. Many states allocate far more funding to nursing homes than to home care, which costs more money, as overall it's more expensive to care for people in nursing homes than at home. Shifting funding to home care SHOULD be bipartisan as it saves money and preserves personal liberty. Studies show that 75-90% of seniors would prefer to receive care at home -- and the Olmstead Supreme Court ruling affirmed the right to receive care in the setting a person chooses. Most states are violating Olmstead right now and people with disabilities have been deep in this fight for decades. Trump's attempt to cut Medicaid and the resulting protests brought the issue to light, and we saved what we have -- but what we have is inadequate and the pandemic has made the crisis even worse. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you work in the media, please cover the home care crisis. It does not get enough attention. I work for a popular health website and do all I can to raise awareness, but when we publish stories about problems in home care, we are mostly preaching to the choir. We need mainstream media coverage and local reporters to interview people who are struggling and put a face on this issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd finally, on an individual level, if you are a healthcare worker, or even someone with no health background who wants to help, consider working as a personal care attendant, direct support professional, etc. for someone with a disability. I know many nurses and CNAs are burnt out due to the pandemic, and this could be a great way to take a breather while still bringing in a bit of income. It's certainly not always an easy job, but you'd be working for one person after caring for dozens without adequate help, and you can find a client with whom you share common interests, who has friendly pets you can hang out with, who likes to go out shopping and travel (when it's safe), who is vaccinated and sane and won't be toxic and abusive. Of course there are assholes who need home care just like any other job, but with consumer-directed care, they choose you AND you choose them. If it's not a good fit, you can stay until they find someone else and move on. Even working one or two days a week could make a huge difference in someone's life who is short on care right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for coming to my ED talk. As in Ed Roberts, founder of the Independent Living movement. Look him up, and keep learning. And nurses, THANK YOU for all you've done to keep people alive (even when they don't deserve it) over the last two nightmarish years, and always.",

    "text": "Cant fix broken system from bedside Yesterday I was sitting in on an interview for a new oncology nurse manager at the hospital where I’ve worked as an RN the last four years. Right off the bat I thought the prospective hire was doing well. He projected sufficient confidence and humility. He seemed likable enough. After about 2 minutes I turned to my coworker and said “Yea, he’s got the job.” He had the appropriate experience, and by the time a candidate has interviewed with higher ups and is brought back to interview with us it means the offer is all but extended. \n\nAs we churned through questions about his past experience, career accomplishments, and pedantic “leadership style” questions, all his responses were appropriate and predictable. He would be hired to tow the line as a middle manager, in a successful corporate hospital, in a failing national healthcare system. *A successful hospital in a failing national health system...* So the job is akin to that of the conductor leading the string quartet on the deck of Titanic going down. \n\nIn our present day there isn’t a single lucid American soul that could truthfully describe our national health system as effective, let alone successful. Byzantine, kafkaesque, and inequitable are the first descriptors that come to my mind. Any healthcare provider could tell you about the inordinate amount of time they spend explaining and apologizing for a health system that’s inadequate and failing, and any patient could corroborate it. So that leaves the question: who wants the job?\n\nI framed a question to the interviewee. “The problems that we have here: the turnover of management, turnover of staff, short staffing, inadequate training, burnout, equipment shortage, communication failures, etc — they’re not unique to us. It’s all a symptom of our greater failing national system. Is there anything you do to advocate for a more equitable, more effective health system beyond the walls of the hospital?” As I asked him this (with less skillful words), I became emotional. I could feel it swelling in my chest and head, though I don’t think my coworkers noticed. I knew how important my point was and that the only accurate answer could be: “*Not enough.*” (That would be my own answer too.) Rather though, the interviewee reiterated how important that question was, talked about the illusory “community” a bit, and I don’t remember much at all specifically about what he said. \n\nBeing a good nurse, going the extra mile for patients, forgoing my break to spend more time providing care at the bedside: none of that’s enough. And attending BLM rallies, supporting and donating to progressive political campaigns, writing my congressperson to receive back form responses the equivalent of a shrug: that’s not enough either. Because at the end of the week I collect a paycheck from the offal too.\n\nBy the time I was graduating high school I had enough knowledge and insight to see that our health system wasn’t working... and beyond that: our education system, our criminal justice system, our financial system — all different arms of a deformed, undeniably racist, unjust society. But eventually I became a nurse, one occupation largely beyond reprove when tracing the lines between all the systemic injustices of our society. On occasion people with no personal knowledge of my life will learn of me being a nurse (like when I’m wearing scrubs on my way to and from work,) and tell me how it’s a noble profession. Few professions are awarded the same universal regard. And I enjoy that regard too. But I also recognize myself as complicit when I spend that paycheck and weeks pass without me taking any concrete action to improve upon the status quo. \n\nI write all this because I know I’m not alone in these thoughts; I’m hopeful for change in the future; and I know open communication is the way forward. I’m looking to keep talking and get moving!!!!",

    "text": "The passion is gone I used to love being a nurse. Certain things have changed my perspective. The biggest was going from a large teaching hospital to a tiny rural community hospital. I was working towards one goal (my passion is oncology, specifically GI oncology and wanted to work in the clinic, I did surgical oncology for 6 years and LOVED it). We moved after the birth of our son to be closer to family and because we couldn’t afford a house with a backyard in the big city. \nIn my new hospital I have bounced around (ICU, PACU, ER, back to ICU at the beginning of the pandemic), and I was never really happy. I enjoyed ICU the most, especially when I got to work with a sick patient. Ultimately, I never planned on spending my entire career at the bedside. I just felt like my options were limited in our rural community. Commuting to a larger hospital isn’t a good option, nor is moving - my son is special needs and we have built a community for him here. And the thought of being 1+ hours away from him while I work, just doesn’t sit right with me. I considered toughing it out in ICU, because I worked with some great nurses and every now and then I would feel a huge sense of pride about my job. One day, I got this feeling that I could use that pride to make things better, so I applied for my masters and moved into a supervisory role. Specifically I am the evening/weekend supervisor. I moved into the role in December and immediately regretted it. I could advocate and vocalize my support for nurses, but ultimately my voice only got me so far (also, I am not American, so I will just throw that out there). I don’t dislike most of our senior leadership, like with staff nurses some are great, some are so-so, and some are awful. I was never really one that looked down on administration. I always viewed at as a necessary role, somebody has to make the decisions and manage the budget. Again, we aren’t for profit like in the US, so budgets are important but extra money doesn’t line the pockets of our administrators). Anyways, I hate the job. I quickly realized that our healthcare system is broken. I am constantly being torn by the different departments. Every unit is short staffed. Our ER is full. We have a large elderly community, and a lot of drug addicts. It doesn’t take much for our hospital to fill up. At the beginning of the pandemic we lost a lot of nurses because we could only work at one hospital. And many just left to go work at larger facilities, and many retired. So now a significant amount of our workforce is new grads. On all the floors. It’s scary. You have burnt out nurses and scared new nurses. It’s horrific. But I can’t shut those ER doors. I wish I could. The patients keep piling in. In the past few weeks it hasn’t been uncommon for their to be 30-40 patients in the waiting room (we have 13 beds in our ER). Nurses are refusing patients, but I can’t let them because the ER has a VSA coming in and are short 3 staff. We have nowhere to divert to because our system is broken… we are the only hospital in our area with a CT and MRI between the two larger cities around us (both 1-2 hours away). I am getting yelled at. I am the only person in any sort of leadership role that has taken care of a Covid positive patient, the only one to work as a bedside nurse during the pandemic (in ICU until February, when they put my transfer to my new role on hold due to a staffing crisis). I am not the person to yell at. I empathize. If I could tell people to stop coming in, I would. What we are experiencing is not the failure of our hospital, it’s the failure of our government. \nI want so badly to go back to the bedside, but right before I started this hellish job I had an accident, and now have a brain injury. I did a shift in the ICU and had to take time off work because of what it did to me. So basically, I feel stuck. I have a job I hate, I feel hated and disrespected when all I wanted to do was try and make things better and advocate for nurses because I get what they are going through. But I can’t. I failed. My passion is gone. \nIf you read all this, thanks. I just needed to get it out, and put everything that I feel  out into the universe.",

    "text": "I am looking for Nurses to exchange knowledge about nursing management in the USA Hello there\n\nMy name is Kai, I'm 23 years old and a trained nurse of 3 years in Germany. Currently I am studying nursing management (this is kinda a big deal, as only 0.5% of all nurses are studied nurses in Germany) and I'm looking for Nurses from the USA who can give me an insight on how exactly nursing is managed there. I admire the American way of nursing and our system has adopted so many different things from your system (beside the insurance but that's another topic).\n\nTo give a bit of historical context: Nursing has historically always been done by nuns exclusively and nursing being very strictly tied to charity and doing nursing for the love of the people and God (Catholic Christianity) and thus shaping the way of thinking about nursing in the mind of the people. Female nurses are always referred to as \"nun xyz\" (Schwester xyz) and nursing has not been an academic subject before the 2000s.\n\nI am looking forward to some great conversations. I am also looking for some kind of nursing exchange if there is any interest.\n\nThanks! :)",

    "text": "Stop \"do it for the kids!\" culture and be more selfish \"She stays 3 hours after school every night. What a great teacher!\"\n\n\"I don't know how he juggles so many things at once - he's amazing!\"\n\n\"How are you doing?\" \"I'm losing my mind.\"\n\n***It can be selfless to put yourself first.***\n\nIf that sounds like a paradox, you are not alone.\n\nPutting yourself first in the world of K12 teaching is counter-culture. Being overworked, overwhelmed, and stressed is worn as a badge of honor.\n\nA frantic pace is so pervasive in the K12 world that even when I managed to slow down, it was easier to pretend I was overwhelmed just to fit in.\n\nEven outside the walls of school, we're conditioned by society to \"feel ashamed of our selfishness, that we are flawed for being so self-centered\" (Tara Brach, Radical Acceptance).\n\nNot only does the culture of overwhelm lead to teacher burnout and stress, it's a severe detriment to students.\n\nWhen you only give of yourself - you have less to give.\n\nSo what's the answer?\n\nHow can you start putting yourself first in ways that not only make you happier, but benefit your students and everyone around you?\n\nMore importantly, how can you do this in a way that feels authentic and not selfish?\n\nI call this the art of being Selfish-ish.\n\n**Being Selfish-ish**\n\nFirst, let’s look at the definition of “Selfish” from the Merriam-Webster dictionary:\n\n\"Seeking or concentrating on one's own advantage, pleasure, or well-being without regard for others\".\n\n“Selfish-ish” omits just three letters from that definition:\n\n“Seeking or concentrating on one's own advantage, pleasure, or well-being WITH~~out~~ regard for others.”\n\nBeing “selfish-ish” means putting yourself first so you have more to give to others.\n\nImportantly, it's NOT the same as being \"selfless\", or \"having no concern for self\".\n\nSelflessness is why the teaching profession is so fraught with [stress and burnout](https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/the-current-state-of-teacher-burnout-in-america).\n\nMost teachers oscillate between two states:\n\n1. Drowning in work while feeling virtuous.\n2. Drowning in guilt while doing things for themselves because they \"could be doing more\" for others.\n\nLearning to be “selfish-ish” provides a third option: stepping out of this pool of death altogether.\n\nA reliving breath of air that allows you to enjoy your life AND care about your students.\n\n**Selfish-ish Teaching**\n\nManaging stress by walking, getting good sleep, meditating, delegating, automating, or saying “no” to draining tasks is not an indulgence. It's a *prerequisite* to being the best teacher you can be.\n\nThe teachers who had the biggest impact on my life all share something in common…\n\nThey had their own, interesting lives outside of school. They went to Radiohead concerts, knitted sleeves for mailboxes, attended \"dragon-conventions\", and took a week off to travel with their family.\n\nIt didn't matter if they were late grading papers a few times. It didn’t matter how friendly they were with their admin. What mattered is that they took care of themselves and put themselves first. It allowed them to show up and teach from their heart.\n\nTo show up each day as their authentic self.\n\nThey were selfish-ish.\n\nHow can you be selfish-ish in an environment where martyrdom is viewed as the barometer of success?\n\n**Three Ways to be Selfish-ish**\n\n**Define \"Enough\"**\n\nKnowing when to stop working and when to be satisfied with what you have done is easier said than done.\n\nMy favorite strategy comes from a book on productivity called Make Time, by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky.\n\nThe authors recommend choosing a single \"highlight\" to focus on each day.\n\nIt could be to finish grading for one assignment, plan a small group lesson, work on your novel for 30 minutes before school, or go on a walk with your kids after school.\n\nA highlight ensures you don't spend all day putting other people first. It also clearly defines what \"enough\" means for you that day.\n\nThere will never be an end to the work that's put on you as a teacher. If you don't define \"enough\" each day, no one else will for you.\n\nIf nothing else but your highlight gets done, the day is a win.\n\nThe highlight strategy is a surprisingly simple way to lower the volume of the nagging voice that says \"I should be doing more\".\n\n**Disconnect**\n\nBefore we jump into the power of disconnecting - a quick story for context…\n\nDuring my second year teaching, I got in two car accidents - one of them leaving me with a concussion that took a year to heal and triggered a spiral of anxiety, depression, and other health problems.\n\nMost days, I had a limited reserve of \"brain power\" before I had to take a break.\n\nAt first, the breaks came with feelings of guilt and failure: \"I'm letting these students down.\"\n\nUntil I had a realization...\n\nThe breaks weren't selfish. The real selfishness was believing I was the linchpin holding the world together.\n\nStudents got on fine without me, people covered for me, and I would return from my breaks better able to be present with them emotionally.\n\nThese forced brain-breaks taught me the importance of creating boundaries between my own life and school life - building brain breaks into each day.\n\n...\n\nEven before the pandemic - technology had already begun blurring the lines between work and home.\n\nA [recent article](https://www.wired.com/story/how-work-became-an-inescapable-hellhole/) from WIRED magazine points out how tech \"improvements\" have done anything but improve our personal lives:\n\n*\"The internet isn’t the root cause of our burnout. But its promise to “make our lives easier” is a profoundly broken one, responsible for the illusion that “doing it all” isn’t just possible, but mandatory. When we fail to do so, we don’t blame the broken tools. We blame ourselves. Deep down, we know the primary exacerbator of burnout isn’t really email, or Instagram, or a constant stream of news alerts. It’s the continuous failure to reach the impossible expectations we’ve set for ourselves.”*\n\nThe K12 world is defined by \"impossible expectations.\" If we don't learn to disconnect, it's easy to blame ourselves for inevitable failures.\n\nSo how do we disconnect?\n\nBe known for being a good teacher, not for being the fastest email replier.\n\nSeriously, *answer emails as slowly as possible without getting in trouble*. If your school imposes a timeline on responses to parents (my schools’ is 24 hours), be in the 12-24 range instead of the 0-12 range.\n\nTreat text messages from workmates or administrators like emails - turning off notifications and only checking them at designated times.\n\nIntentionally disconnecting gives you time to recharge and protect your students' biggest asset - you.\n\nIf this scares you, start small by turning off notifications for a few hours each night - you might be surprised how little you miss out on.\n\n**Indulge**\n\nDo unproductive things that serve no purpose other than your enjoyment.\n\nTake a long bath, read poetry, walk around the block, exercise, meditate, paint, dance, get a massage (when it's safe).\n\nIf these things cause guilt or feel unproductive, remind yourself what the point of productivity is:\n\n*“...productivity and output are not ends in themselves... if I catch myself feeling guilty for being unproductive, I have to remind myself that the point of working is so that I can have those moments of unproductivity.”* \\- Nat Eliason\n\nWorking hard for years on end can quickly make you lose sight of why you were working so hard in the first place.\n\nProductivity is not the end goal. The end goal is probably something more like \"living a happy, fulfilled life where I get to inspire young minds and spend time with my family\".\n\nOften the most productive way to that goal is something completely unproductive.\n\nIn choosing to be selfish-ish, you might fear judgement from your coworkers, administrators, parents, or students.\n\nIn my experience, you're more likely to get envious curiosity than judgement: “how do you stay so calm?”, “what’s your secret?”.\n\nFair warning: If you're not used to putting yourself first, you are fighting against decades of societal conditioning telling you that it's shameful to do so.\n\nJust remember that your spirit, your health, your energy (or whatever you want to call it) is the single most valuable thing to your students - not your output.\n\nBe intentional with it (Define “enough”), protect it (disconnect), and put it first (indulge).\n\nEmbrace the art of being Selfish-ish.\n\nYou'll be less stressed, more relaxed, and better able to share your gifts with students.",

It'll help you understand who we are fighting.**\n\nSociopaths also believe that we, people who feel empathy, and have a conscience are gullible, weak, and liars. In an interview Dr. Martha Stout gave she said: *\"One sociopath told me that he thought he was the only honest person because he would admit that he didn’t have a conscience and everybody else was clearly faking it.\"*\n\nThis reads true when you learn about how Republican and American Libertarian beloved author **Ayn Rand admired a Serial Killer's sociopathic qualities. Ayn Rand wrote in her journals: \"Other people do not exist for him, and he does not see why they should,\" she wrote, gushing that Hickman had \"no regard whatsoever for all that society holds sacred, and with a consciousness all his own.**\n\nThe **\"FREEDOM\"** Republicans are constantly screaming about is the freedom to brutalize others without reprisal i.e. the freedom to be sociopaths. This comment doesn't mean I absolve democrat politicians. Democrat politicians have proven that they too are a good mix of sociopath or narcissist.\n\n**Why is this important?

So they are rightfully expressing their rage and frustration about the futility and stupidity of not only being in school, but being taught preCOVID education.\n\n**Our kids understand that our country and capitalism rewards sociopathic behaviors. So why can't you?**\n\nIt's because we have been lied to and propagandized our whole lives that Capitalism is not only good, but its the only \"sane\" economic system.\n\n**Do you feel comfortable?**\n\n**Has work made you comfortable?**\n\n**How long do you need to work to reach comfort?**\n\nThe ruling class desires you to give up everything except work. \n\nMaybe its time we stopped trying to solve our problems individually attempting the same solution and instead united in solidarity and just stopped.\n\nAlso, I might be wrong but I'm of the opinion that bullies throw tantrums and attack others to force those people to do what they want.\n\n**So what should you do now?

    "text": "Does this describe your school? How modern segregation works in an American school... A user in the politics sub laid out in comments a very lucid account of how his seemingly integrated school is in fact very segregated and has very different outcomes for white and PoC students. I've seen aspects of this in schools I've worked in -- although not quite as stark or severe -- and I wondered how common this from the perspective of U.S. teachers here. And what can we as educators do to address this sort of structural inequality?\n\nThis sub doesn't allow x-post links, so I'm excerpting -- you can find the post on r/bestof.\n\n>At my high school the way it worked was the school itself was a very old  and historic downtown institution. Hundreds of years old.  Big beautiful  building literally on the tallest hill.  \n>  \n>Lots of famous people graduated from it in the early 20th century, and not surprisingly it was all-white for most of that time.  \n>  \n>\\[...\\] in the  2000s the freshman class was about 30% black and 20% Latino.  \n>  \n>It was a relatively good school; so it’s not a surprise that PoC students who lived in walking distance wanted to attend.  \n>  \n>And they *really* wanted to attend, because their other options were the two all-black high schools or the one Latino high school. \\[...\\]  \n>  \n>Side  note:  those two schools were literally toxic (built on a superfund  site), and literally crumbling (walls falling down). They were sh$t  holes.   The Latino high school was a little nicer, but still seriously  underfunded and >95% Spanish speaking IIRC.  \n>  \n>None of those three schools had college admission rates over 25% or graduation rates over 75%.  \n>  \n>Anyway,  the white kids however, were mostly rich kids who were 2nd, 3rd, 4th,  or even 10th generation students! \\[...\\]  \n>  \n>“4th  generation rich white kids” don’t live near downtown in the modern American Midwest city— so most of the white students were commuting up to an hour to get to class. \\[...\\]  \n>  \n>The school actually had a  very very big waitlist for these “out of district” spots, and was  operating significantly over capacity.  We even had portable “temporary”  classrooms set up on the practice football field.  \n>  \n>But the **alumni donations**  from these rich multigeneration families made up a large portion of the  operating budget of the school.  That money was the main reason the  school was so good!  \n>  \n>I know I’m getting a little off track here, but think about that dynamic.  \n>  \n>explicit segregation is illegal  \n>  \n>more rich white kids from the suburbs want to attend than you have space for  \n>  \n>parents of the rich white kids fund the school  \n>  \n>the school is way over crowded  \n>  \n>you can’t stop local black & brown kids from attending  \n>  \n>So what do you do?  \n>  \n>1️⃣ First, you segregate the students during the school days.  \n>  \n>You do this because the rich racist parents don’t want their brats going to class with undesirable black, brown, or poor people.  \n>  \n>This  is pretty easy to do, because the rich white kids are going to 1st-8th  grade at their suburban schools in a different district.  \n>  \n>Those suburbanites get funnled straight into an all-white “honors system” of classes on the first day of freshman year.  \n>  \n>The prerequisites for those “honors” classes are conveniently only offered at the suburban schools.  \n>  \n>PoC students have no way in.  \n>  \n>(I put “honors” in quotes because these kids were NOT smarter, and there were no tests they had to pass.)  \n>  \n>2️⃣  You make the school experience for the white kids as high quality as  possible while making the experience for everyone else as bad as  possible.  \n>  \n>The white kids’ have  nicer classrooms with lots of sunlight, digital white boards, and 20  students or so.  They have better teachers, and more rigorous academics  available to them.  They get guidance counseling aimed at helping them  navigate the college admissions process, etc.  \n>  \n>The  black kids are packed 33 at a time into crappy basement classrooms with  chalk boards. Their teachers are alcoholic sports coaches, and their  “counseling” is about picking a ~~menial~~ working class career  after graduation (something that doesn’t involve college, like:  mechanic, waiter, hairstylist, taxi driver, etc).  \n>  \n>3️⃣  You segregate all the extra curriculars as much as you can.  \n>  \n>The newspaper and yearbook were white.  The debate team was white.  \n>  \n>The  only integrated extracurriculars were a few of the varsity sports  (basketball, track, and football had black kids \\[...\\]  \n>  \n>Oh, and the choir and the school musical were integrated because they had open auditions.  \n>  \n>(Although  the drama department still managed to do a second big production every  year that was, you guessed it, more exclusive, bigger budget, and all  white).  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>4️⃣ you create a system to funnel the black and brown kids you don’t want there out of the school as fast as possible.  \n>  \n>This  can be done through selective enforcement of truancy rules. It can be  done with extremely harsh grading of the “bad” classes.  \n>  \n>Lots of ways to do it.  But the end result is pretty easy to describe in numbers, because my class size was nearly 1000 exactly.  \n>  \n>On the first day of high school, me and about 999 other students showed up.  \n>  \n>About 500 white freshmen (mostly from suburbs)  \n>  \n>About 300 black freshmen  \n>  \n>About 200 Latinx freshmen\n\n\\[...\\]\n\n>Of the 500 white students, about 50 would drop out or transfer before graduation.  BUT, a new 50 would transfer *into* the school.  \n>  \n>So  the graduating white class would be about 500. Over 95% of the white  graduates went on to attend a four year colllege, many of them Ivy  Leagues.  \n>  \n>Of the 500 PoC students,  about 250 would drop out, or be forced by the academic office to change  schools by Junior year.  Another 100 would drop out or transfer before  the end of senior year.  \n>  \n>About 150  total would graduate.  About half of them would go to college, and less  than half of that group would graduate college.  \n>  \n>So final score for “preparing students for life” is:  \n>  \n>500 PoC freshmen = about 150 high school diplomas and about 40 college diplomas.  \n>  \n>500 white freshmen = about 500 high school diplomas, and about 400 college diplomas.  \n>  \n>Also,  it’s hard to even know the distinction between drop out and transfer,  as the system was designed to hide the drop out rates.  My high school **officially** listed all drop outs as transfers.  \n>  \n>And the schools they “transferred” to?  They just never listed those kids as attending.  \n>  \n>The  kids functionally just disappear from the system like they have moved  out of state.   No one looks to check if that happened, because no one  wants to know.  But everyone knows.  \n>  \n>This is still happening to this day.  \n>  \n>It’s a nice neat little system beautifully encapsulating white hegemony & how *systems* can enforce white supremacy.  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]TLDR:  the system was  & still is essentially designed so that rich white kids can go to  their parent’s alma-mater downtown, but won’t have to interact with  black or brown students. The way that is achieved is by making life as  bad for PoC students as possible.",

    "text": "That does it. I'm out. I've had enough.\n\nFirst it was getting screwed out of a promotion when new management came in.  I busted my ass for this time and earned my stripes with the previous management,  for which I was offered a department lead position.  I wouldn't have cared if they said \"Look, you've only been working here for two-and-a-half years and Alice has been working here for 5.  We believe the most senior person should get promoted.\"  But they went out of their way to show that Alice (not her real name) is the new golden child (she's the only member of the old staff who got promoted - they brought their own people in for other leadership/management roles).\n\nNew admin is cliquey.  They show no sign of wanting to support the teachers who are already here, who have been building the school for the last 5 years.  They've made it clear that they have no faith in certain teachers (in particular former military and industry), since they prefer the \"traditional path\" teachers.\n\nNow this:\n\nOur school is divided between students who are above-average to pretty strong academically and students who really struggle to keep up.  30% are pretty strong academically, and 50% are just average, and 20% are lagging behind.  Recently new management has decided something has to be done about the disparity.  They claim that there is a disparity among achievement among ethnic groups.  Asian, Latino and White students tend to do better than Black students.  They want to correct this.  Most teachers agree that something should be done, but we just don't agree about HOW it has to be done.\n\nNew admin suggests what essentially amounts to cooking the books.  Since we're private, we don't have IEP's.  Kids who are struggling are placed in a special \"Learning Assistance Program\".  Students in this program cannot be given lower than a 60 on any assignment as long as that assignment is turned in.  They can't be failed for a class until we've met with the parents three times, and a reams of paperwork are signed.  Electives and sports count towards GPA, and we're to make accomodations in grading as well.  Kids in the Learning Assistance Program can't be suspended.  They get special projects that basically boost their GPA.  Teachers have to bump up grades sometimes by more than an entire letter grade at the request of admin for these projects, which for whatever reason, we're not allowed to see.  Honors classes will no longer be weighted.\n\nThe result is that even less than one month in, in the Learning Assistance Program are basically starting to game the system.  In some cases I was basically requested to dictate the correct answers to students during tests, or to upload homework answers to Moodle so that the students could \"print that out and submit it\".  Literally all they're doing is printing stuff out, putting their name on it, and I'm required to give them an A because they've answered everything correctly.\n\nNot to mention that we now have kids intentionally acting up in class (e.g. dancing in the aisles  or bouncing a basketball to get on teachers' nerves), or in some instances verbally threatening teachers.  Some students have been openly defiant and admin shrugs it off because \"different cultures have different attitudes towards authority\".  These kids are acting up are either white or black American.  The \"different culture\" kids are more or less respectful.\n\nNeedless to say, some people think it's unfair.  We have a lot of first-generation Asian and Latino immigrants who came to this country with the dream of \"making something of themselves\".  These kids are driven as heck to perform well academically.  But they are not given Learning Assistance.\n\nAdmin doesn't want to backpedal on the policy and demands that we check our privilege, ignoring that our student body and current academic team is pretty diverse already.\n\nI refuse to lie just so my admins can look good and appear as some great humanitarians when they are chasing their own ego.  As soon as I've secured a job for next year, I'm out.",

    "text": "Tennessee educators oppose attacks on teachers’ free speech rights [Statement of the Tennessee Educators Rank-and-File Safety Committee](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/07/20/tenn-j20.html) regarding the recent passage of a bill that bans the discussion of anything that “promot\\[es\\] division between, or resentment of, a race, sex, religion, creed, nonviolent political affiliation, social class, or class of people.” Essentially a ban on critical race theory, discussion of social class, or any other perspective on history that runs counter to the state government's desired world view. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Tennessee Educators Rank-and-File Safety Committee opposes the legislation (HB 0580/SB 0623) passed by Tennessee’s right-wing legislature aimed at intimidating teachers and attacking their free speech and academic freedom.\n\nThis legislation includes a prohibition against instruction that “promot\\[es\\] division between, or resentment of, a race, sex, religion, creed, nonviolent political affiliation, social class, or class of people.”\n\nLater, the bill nonsensically qualifies this prohibition with the claim that “this section does not prohibit” schools or instructors from making use of textbooks or instructional materials that discuss “the history of an ethnic group” or include “the impartial discussion of controversial aspects of history” or “the impartial instruction on the historical oppression of a particular group of people based on race, ethnicity, class, nationality, religion, or geographic region.”\n\nThis distinction between the “promotion” of divisions and the “impartial discussion” of them seems to be intentionally vague. We cannot escape the conclusion that the legislators hope to intimidate teachers into avoiding controversial topics to avoid getting into trouble.\n\nA [series of similar laws](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/06/22/crit-j22.html) has been passed throughout the country in states with Republican-dominated legislatures. As awful as they are, these laws are only the opening shot in a broader campaign to undermine any kind of socially critical instruction in schools. Two laws recently [passed in Florida](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/06/26/flor-j26.html) go even further than the legislation in Tennessee and serve as a warning to educators everywhere.\n\nThe Florida laws restructure civics education in high schools and require that students pass a civic literacy assessment either in high school or in college in order to prove their grasp of the supposed evils of communism as compared with the supposedly more democratic US political system. The legislation requires public universities to survey faculty and students on their political beliefs and face a possible loss of funding if not enough students and faculty profess their allegiance to a right-wing perspective. Nothing in the legislation guarantees the anonymity of the responses, which brings into question what will be done to those individuals who answer in a way that displeases the state’s right-wing legislature.\n\nFrom the anticommunist McCarthyite witch-hunts in the United States to the purging of Jewish and left-wing academics from German universities by the Nazi party, the practice of drawing up lists of dissidents has a dark history.\n\nThe Tennessee Educators Rank-and-File Safety Committee condemns this legislation and stands with Florida primary and secondary school and university teachers and students in opposing these laws.\n\nAlready, the Tennessee legislation has been used to target an individual teacher. Matthew Hawn, a tenured high school social studies teacher in Sullivan County, Tennessee, came under attack the day after the state legislature passed HB 0580/SB 0623 into law. Hawn assigned his class to read an essay titled, “The First White President,” by Ta-Nehisi Coates, that was published in the *Atlantic*. For this he was censured by the school board and suspended without pay pending possible termination.\n\nOur committee has fundamental disagreements with the theoretical foundations and historical claims expressed by Hawn himself and outlined in this essay. This outlook is inspired by the concepts of critical race theory, which posits the existence of irreconcilable racial divisions in our society, above all in the working class. Nevertheless, we oppose all efforts to censor Hawn and other teachers who have views similar to his. The open discussion of a variety of points of view is of the utmost importance to the education of young people in our society.\n\nSocial class is the fundamental division in our society, not “race, sex, religion, or creed.” Class divisions and the resentments they produce are real, not the mere inventions of teachers. Moreover, the current fascistic and anti-socialist attacks on teachers are taking place in the context of a dramatic intensification of real class divisions.\n\nNowhere are divisions of class more apparent than in the response of the political representatives of the ruling class to the emerging coronavirus variants, which threaten to reverse even the meager progress accomplished by the partial vaccination of the US and world population. The emergence of these variants is the direct result of the politicians’ criminally irresponsible policies of herding workers back into unsafe working conditions and teachers and students back into unsafe schools. Meanwhile, the wealthy continue to have access to safe working environments and the best care the medical profession has to offer.\n\nIgnoring the urgent warnings of the World Health Organization and epidemiologists around the world, the Biden administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reversed masking recommendations, continuing in all fundamental respects the very same policies pursued by the Trump administration. This has provided fertile ground for the virus to evolve, further threatening the lives of workers and their children.\n\nThe Delta variant now presents a triple threat in the schools. Under conditions where children under 12 years old, roughly half the school-aged population, are not yet eligible for vaccination, and most children 12 years old or older remain unvaccinated, the withdrawal of mask recommendations will fuel the spread of the disease, promoting the evolution of new and even more dangerous variants, and killing or permanently disabling an untold number of children, teachers, their family members and the broader population.\n\nNational divisions in vaccine production and distribution, which have created a situation where most of the world’s poorer countries have little or no access to any COVID-19 vaccine, are further fueling these same processes.\n\nIf human life rather than private profit were the priority, the pandemic could be brought under control within months. However, the capitalist classes in nearly every country have not taken the necessary measures to end the pandemic because doing so would run counter to their profit interests.\n\nThe wealth divide in American society continues to grow, intensifying the class struggle on a global scale. Aided and abetted by the corrupt, corporatist trade unions and their pseudo-left acolytes, the American capitalists are pursuing record profits at the expense of human lives. Worldwide, billionaires’ wealth surged 60 percent during the first year of the pandemic alone.\n\nAgain, teachers have not *created* these class divisions and antagonisms. The capitalist class itself is working with ruthless abandon to deepen the existing divisions in our society, which is the real cause of deepening resentments. How could we *not* resent the fact that the capitalist class is threatening the lives of working people and our children simply in order to enrich itself?\n\nThe capitalists are well aware that they cannot get away with their homicidal behavior indefinitely without producing a massive social explosion the likes of which the world has never seen. Under conditions in which the class struggle increasingly threatens to break out of the stranglehold of the corporatist trade unions, which for decades have functioned as little more than an auxiliary police force for workplace management, the capitalist class, above all its more fascistic elements, are concerned about the role that public education institutions could come to play in the discussion and dissemination of ideas critical of the capitalist system itself.\n\nSo, we understand *why* the Tennessee legislature is attacking our free speech and trying to intimidate us into silence. However, understanding and justification are not the same thing. HB 0580/SB 0623 is unjustifiable and unconstitutional. Teachers have the first amendment right to discuss and oppose the acts of class warfare of the capitalist class, including in the classroom.\n\nWe demand the immediate repeal of HB 0580/SB 0623, the immediate reinstatement with back pay of Michael Hawn, and an end to all further efforts to victimize individual teachers or their schools for the content of their instruction.",

Because at some point, it stops being a classroom management issue. Teachers are doing the right things, by and by, but what I'm continually seeing is kids acting out because of factors that are far outside the realm of a classroom teacher. Mental health issues, addiction, poor parenting, no stability, food insecurity, like just go through the ACES. There's little buy in to the educational process, parents are often hostile to anything school personel do and the kids themselves are apathetic about the whole ball of wax.    \n\n\nAnd honestly, there is precious little that a school system can do if a kid has no buy in to hold them accountable.

    "text": "Coming Full Circle / Le Cordon Bleu & the Public School System I'm a dual certified teacher with 17 years as an elementary teacher and 14 years and counting in Culinary Arts. Despite having lived and worked in two different warzones as an expatriate teacher in the international American schools, nothing in my 31 years of experience could have prepared me for the past year. In reading the posts on this board, I have seen many complaints about lax district attendance requirements for virtual education and hybrid. I have also seen a growing number of posts about administrative pressure to inflate grades given how abysmally some students have become during the current crisis.\n\nWhile I have not had any first experience with grade inflation at my school, in an effort to \"improve\" our attendance rates, my district has unintentionally undermined our virtual instruction. Per district policy, we are required to mark students present if any one of the following conditions were met.\n\n1. The student attended your virtual class. (It doesn't matter if the student just logged in and then logged out without bothering to stay for instruction. The mere fact that he or she even bothered to log on counts towards attendance credit for that student's class.)\n2. The student didn't log into your virtual class but did log onto Canvas which is our instructional support platform where we keep all student lessons and assignments. If a student logged into Canvas on the day you had your virtual class, that student will be marked as present.\n3. If the student sends his or her teacher an email on the day you had a virtual class, that student will be marked present.\n\nThe students aren't stupid. A lot of them have milked the system and my attendance rate has dropped to the point where I only have 1-2 students out of a class of 16 who bother to attend any of my virtual classes.\n\nConcurrent with the bad attendance has been the growing failure of students to complete any of my assignments. At least 40% of my students are failing. Some haven't even logged onto Canvas in two months.\n\nI think there are a lot of parallels between what's been happening in many of our public school systems and what happened to the American division of the Le Cordon Bleu culinary schools.\n\nIn France, Le Cordon Bleu is a widely respected and venerated culinary school that was first opened in 1895. Throughout the last 126 years, a succession of great chefs have taught the next generation of culinarians whose ranks have included the likes of Julia Childs, Giada De Laurentiis, and Mario Batali\n\nIn 2000 Le Cordon Bleu entered into a partnership with Career Education Corp. (CEC), a company that bought up private vocational schools in the United States.  Instead of adopting the Le Cordon Bleu curriculum and standards, the CEC slapped the Le Cordon Bleu logo on their culinary uniforms and campus signage. When the American division first opened, these schools included the Southern California School of Culinary Arts of Pasadena, California; the Western Culinary Institute of Portland, Oregon; the International Culinary Academy of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; the Scottsdale Culinary institute of Scottsdale, Arizona; and the Midwest Culinary Academy of Mendota Heights, Minnesota. In time, the American maintained and operated 16 schools. Trading upon the Le Cordon Bleu name, at the height of their popularity these schools generated an annual net revenue of some $100 million dollars.\n\nAs a 2003 Le Cordon Bleu graduate, I had the dubious distinction of watching this school begin its slow decline almost from the moment it first opened its doors. After having burned out as an elementary teachers after 17 years in the profession, I cashed out my Texas Teacher Retirement account to pay for my tuition at the Texas Culinary Academy in Austin. I was 40 years old at the time. My father still insists that I was having a mid-life crisis.\n\nMy class had about forty students. While most of the students were recent high school graduates, our very oldest classmate was in his 50's, though a life of hard living had made him look a decade older. I was the 2nd oldest student in the class. There were also a handful of students in their 30's. The ranks of the older students included a registered nurse, a veteran who had mustered out after 20 years in the service, a pastor, a computer engineer, and a restaurant line cook.\n\nOur school uniforms consisted of white culinary jackets with the Le Cordon Bleu logo emblazoned over the left chest. We also wore herring bone black and white cook trousers, black socks, and close toed non-skid shoes, along with a white skull cap. In addition to our textbook, we were each issued a black tool kit that included a complete knife set.\n\nAlthough the CEC had published and distributed a set of student handbooks that outlined the school rules and expectations, these standards were rarely applied. In theory, students who were late to class should have been barred from attendance and made to attend a Saturday makeup session. In reality, none of the chef instructors seemed to care if students were as much as 30 minutes late.\n\nStudents were expected to come to class wearing clean uniforms. In reality, some students came to class wearing jackets that were stained with ingredients that had been used during the previous day. One student even showed up wearing sandals with black socks. The chef instructor let this student stay even though his clothing was a health code safety violation.\n\nA lot of the younger students didn't bother doing their reading assignments or their written homework. Many of these didn't even bother to take notes in class before we went to the kitchen for our hands-on production lessons.\n\nSince most culinary classes teach students in cooperative learning groups of 3-4, the older students banded together into two groups out of vested self interest. We did this because we had work ethics and standards. We read the assignments. We completed the written homework. We also took notes.\n\nDuring our lab time in the kitchen, many of the younger students would disappear for extended smoke breaks of 30 minutes or longer. They wouldn't help with production. They wouldn't help with cleaning the kitchen. Since we were working in cooperative groups, each group shared a common grade. Those of us who were responsible didn't think that these other students deserved to share our grade since they made no contributions to our group effort.\n\nAt the end of our course of study, as part of our graduation requirement we were expected to complete a three month externship under the supervision of a chef or a kitchen manager. Students who had been allowed to develop slovenly habits and to show up late for class had a rude awakening when they tried to act the same way in the commercial food service.\n\nEven though the Le Cordon Bleu schools were still relatively new, by the time I got to my externship, it was hard finding anyone who would take me. The Texas Culinary Academy had already developed a dismal reputation among most of the area restaurants. Students were late to work. Students were improperly attired. Students thought they could get away with 30 minute smoke breaks. Those students who hadn't paid attention in class and who had not assisted in the kitchen were quite out of their depth and lacked the basic skills that a culinary extern should have had.\n\nI was lucky. I eventually found a placement with a boutique hotel that had an attached French restaurant. I completed my externship without problems and graduated with honors. As with nearly anything else in life, what I got out of the program reflected what I had put into it. I went on to work in the food service for five years before returning to education as the chef instructor of a high school Culinary Arts program.\n\nI was successful. A lot of my former classmates were not. Since Le Cordon Bleu did not hold their students to high standards, their reputation suffered. In time, student externs could not find placements. Le Cordon Bleu graduates could not find jobs.  In 2015, CEC tried to sell their schools but the Le Cordon Bleu label was so badly tarnished in the United States that they wound up announcing their pending closure. No new enrollments were accepted after January of 2016. The last classes graduated in September of 2017.\n\nLe Cordon Bleu is an example of what can happen when you don't enforce high expectations regarding attendance, student participation, and grades.\n\nI started teaching in 1982 before President George Bush's No Child Left Behind Act ushered in accountability testing. For those of you who are old enough to recall what teaching was like BEFORE accountability testing you may remember that some schools and some districts had similar lax standards.\n\nBefore accountability testing, elementary students were often \"socially promoted.\" It didn't matter that these students were failing and had cruddy attendance. During my first elementary teaching job in a Title I district on the south Texas border, my principal told me that kids who were retained would suffer worse from the emotional trauma of being left behind than if they were promoted with \"a few\" academic deficiencies.\n\nAlthough I was a novice teacher at the time, I remember thinking that my 5th grade students were 2-3 grade levels deficient in both reading and math. If the principal thought that these were \"a few\" academic deficiencies, I couldn't help wondering what a glaring deficiency might have looked like.\n\nThe problem with having lax standards was that some schools were graduating students who were functional illiterates. Back in 1977, the U.S. Office of Education estimated that an estimated 23 MILLION American adults were functional illiterates who lacked the ability to read restaurant menus and train schedules.\n\nIn 1976, a student named [Peter W. sued the San Francisco Unified School District](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/217048241.pdf) because they had graduated him even though he was only on a 5th grade reading level and had failed several grades. The plaintiff alleged that in failing to properly educate him, he had been relegated to a life of manual labor since this was all that he was qualified to do. The trial court dismissed the complaint. This was subsequently upheld upon appeal because Peter W's failure of educational achievement was not accepted by the court as an \"injury: within the meaning of tort law.\n\nAnother lawsuit followed. In 1976 [Edward Donohue](https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/20/archives/a-graduate-who-says-he-cant-read-saying-he-is-functionally.html) was graduated even though he couldn't read at all. In 1977, he sued his former school for \"educational malpractice.\"\n\nHis lawsuit alleged that even though he had failed all of his classes during his junior year (except for woodshop), he was socially promoted and became a senior. He was even placed in a senior English class despite having failed English as a junior.\n\nDoes any of this sound familiar to our current education climate?\n\nThe teachers at Mr. Donohue's former high school said that there was an unofficial rule that said that they could not fail more than 15% of their students. Instead of actually educating their students, there was pressure from the building administration to graduate students as a way of getting rid of them.\n\nI  wish I could say that Edward Donohue had a fortuitous outcome to his lawsuit. I am sorry to say that he did not. In 1977 in [Donohue v Copiague Unified School District](https://www.leagle.com/decision/197948747ny2d4401440), the court found in favor of the district. The summary statement alluded to, \"the practical impossibility of proving that the alleged malpractice of the teacher proximately caused the learning deficiency of the plaintiff student. Factors such as the student's attitude, motivation, temperament, past experience and home environment may all play an essential and immeasurable role in learning. Indeed as the majority observes proximate cause might 'be difficult, if not impossible, to prove'.\"\n\nIt wasn't until 1981 ([Hoffman v. Board of Education](https://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1427&context=hlr)) that a plaintiff was (partially) successful in pursuing an educational malpractice lawsuit. Daniel Hoffman was a student in the New York City Schools. At the age of five the school district placed him in a class for the mentally retarded. He remained in this class for the next 12 years despite the fact that a school psychologist had insisted that he wasn't retarded but instead suffered from a low self image. Although the court awarded the plaintiff $500,000 in damages, this judgement was reversed upon appeal and the case was dismissed.\n\nThe reality for all of us is that this isn't 1976, 1977, or 1981. It's 2021 and the times have changed.\n\nIn 2016,  a high school graduate Jamarria Hall joined a class action lawsuit with six former students in suing the Detroit public schools because the district was graduating students who were illiterate. As a junior and later a senior Mr. Hall alleged that his English teachers taught him using 3rd and 4th grade level books.  His attorney alleged that his former school was literally falling apart and lacked certified teachers and up-to-date textbooks. It argued that conditions were so appalling that in one instance an 8th grade student took the initiative to teach math to his classmates for a month after his teacher quit and the school was unable to find a replacement.\n\nIn May of 2020, after four long years of legal battles, the Detroit Public Schools settled and agreed to pay the seven former students a total of $7 million to settle this education malpractice claim. In settling they have also created a legal precedent for future education malpractice claims.\n\nThe implications of this recent case should be clear. School districts may successfully be sued for educational malpractice. While school administrators seek short term relief by having teachers inflate grades so as to appease the school board and angry parents, if these practices were to continue, it could have serious legal implications in the years to come.\n\nNot to detract from the validity of anything that I have said, but this is also why teachers should belong to a union. Most unions offer legal representation and liability coverage as part of their benefits.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nEdited: I graduated from Le Cordon Bleu, Texas Culinary Academy in 2003, not 2001.

    "text": "This year just really sucks I’m not really sure if I’m venting or needing advice. This year is completely ruining me. My good days are fine but my bad days are so incredibly low. My good days used to actually be good though, and that’s what is so hard.\n\nIt’s my sixth year teaching. I taught four years of kindergarten in the state I was born in, moved to a different state in 2020 and taught kindergarten in person, and moved again to a different state this summer and am now teaching second grade. I was very burnt out last year as my teammate and school sucked. The kids were okay but it was a bougie private school with many entitled parents. \n\nI was pretty hesitant about teaching this year because I decided to move in May and didn’t think I’d get a job in the districts I was looking to get into. Surprisingly, a second grade position in the best school district in my new state wanted to interview me. I couldn’t find much info on the school but it is Title 1 and even though I wasn’t super interested in second grade, I wanted to proceed mostly so I could get into the district. Well, I was offered the position and decided to take it.\n\nI won’t lie, there’s a part of me that regrets it. My class is completely out of control and we literally can hardly get any learning done because I am dealing with so many behaviors. To top it off, my school is against any form of consequence and only wants teachers to use positivity and the power of relationships. I totally get that but it doesn’t always work that way and some kids need a natural consequence for their behavior. My kids know they can get away with so much because there literally isn’t anything I can really do. I have good classroom management but these students just do whatever they want, whenever they want. We literally spend about an hour each day going step by step practicing routines and expectations because they cannot do them correctly. \n\nIt’s been like 20 days of school and I can’t even count how many times I’ve already cried, woke up in the middle of the night from stress, and literally wished I was sick or injured as an excuse not to go back for a while. I know it doesn’t help that I just moved and am still learning the new curriculum and an unfamiliar grade level. I find myself hardly caring about this job because I am so burnt out and can only give the little that is left in my tank each day. \n\nUnfortunately, that feeling also makes me feel extremely guilty. Also, the kids who I am working with have some heartbreaking homes lives and I absolutely take that into account when I see how bad the behaviors can be. The only thing truly keeping me going is the hope that I inspire a kid because they really do love me and tell me that all the time. Those moments fill my bucket so much but all the other shit drains it in a matter of moments.\n\nThere’s a huge part of me that thinks the American education system is truly just fucked and it’s going to suck no matter what grade or school I am teaching at from here on out. Part of me wants to get into educational policy to actually do something about the mess, another part of me wants to quit education entirely, and the other part of me just wants to switch schools and teach kindergarten again and retire with my pension in this district. \n\nI’m at the point when people ask me at work how things are going, I can’t just give the generic “good” response because it’s anything but that. Some of these people have hardly met me and are just trying to make small talk but I can’t do it. I need people to know I am not okay and I literally hate the teacher charade that so many put on. \n\nWhen I have my worst days, I browse this sub and it always makes me feel so much better that I’m not alone.",

    "text": "3 Questions that have been bothering me as a Student Teacher I’ve been loving student teaching. I’m at a super small school in my home state of Iowa, and we currently have no one out because of COVID (but we do have kids getting the craps, unfortunately.) By this summer I should be graduated, and hopefully by fall I’ll be teaching. But I have a million different questions going through my mind and I was wondering if some of you might give me insight to three big ones?\n\nThe last few weeks, politicians have been pushing for legislation in Iowa that I feel shows that Iowa is not headed in the right direction. Countless anti-trans bills, vouchers were just approved so public schools will lose funding to private schools, and now republicans have introduced legislation that would take away funding from a school if they taught about 1619 (looking at how slavery has affected modern American life.) As a gay man, I can guarantee you Iowa doesn’t have much to offer me either. With all this in mind, I’ve been thinking of different scenarios in which I could “escape.”\n\n1) **What does it exactly mean when a state has reciprocity with mine?** Iowa has reciprocity with Illinois for example; that means I won’t need to take any additional “Praxis” tests, right? Unlike Minnesota, I’d need to take more tests :/\n\n2) **Does it look bad if a first year teacher goes out of state?** I’m interested in living in a bigger town to see what it’s like (Chicago, New York), but at the same time, if a principal hears it’s my first year, and I’m away from home, are they less likely to hire me? My CT said no, but I also know she hates the idea of being out of Iowa, so I wanted the opinion of someone that has tried leaving their home state.\n\n3) **To teachers that live in big towns like Chicago/New York, how do you afford it?!?!** I grew up & was raised in poverty. I had to do some forms for financial aid today so I could pay my Bill for the semester, and in doing so I found out my parents only have $45 in the bank. My Dad only made $9,000 last year, too. I dream of escaping Iowa and finally being happy, living on my own and discovering my own community. But I feel trapped here, because I don’t know how I would manage it since being poor is all I’ve ever known.\n\nI’m the first one in my family to graduate from college. It feels surreal. And I know people say teachers are underpaid, but even if I was paid $20,000 a year, that’s way more than my Dad makes in an average year.. Right now I have around $10,000 saved due to working non stop this last summer combined with savings, but I know that would go **super** fast in a bigger town. How do you all do it?\n\nThere wouldn’t happen to be a guide on how to escape Iowa, would there be? A part of me wonders if I shouldn’t just teach in Iowa close to a big town for a few years and then move away. I’m not sure. Well, I appreciate you if you read this far. I appreciate any advice for any questions too!",

    "text": "Do my coworkers have a problem with me, or is it just a cultural misunderstanding on my part? I hope this is the right place to ask a question like this, and PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE read this in the best possible light as I am not trying to offend anyone or make any stereotypical judgements. I simply want to know if I am overthinking things or if there is actually an issue with my working relationships.\n\nI naturally have a lot of social anxiety, so this is not the type of thing I deal with very well with and I tend to overthink and overanalyse minor social situations. So this post is going to be much longer than it probably needs to. Apologies.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nFor a bit of context, I am American and I joined an Australian company in February. Due to COVID I've have had very little in-person interaction with my coworkers. The job has been going very well, albeit stressful and demanding, but I'm very proud to have landed this role and I think my superiors and the company in general value me. I also get along very well with almost everyone I interact with (as far as I know).\n\nHowever, there are three female coworkers in different branches, all who give me an antagonistic vibe. All three are very curt with me - I would even consider them downright rude. \n\nIt's hard to pinpoint something specific, but every interaction makes me feel uncomfortable and I can't help thinking they each have a personal issue with me. Their emails are short and without pleasantries, they often don't respond to me via chat, and write in ways that I take as passive aggressive. They are also the only three British people I work with.\n\nLike I said I have no interest in stereotyping in a negative way - I'm definitely not trying to suggest that British people *are* rude. I'm just wondering if office culture in the UK is different than what I'm used to in the US and Australia, and so maybe I'm misinterpreting English professionalism as American/Australian rudeness?\n\nFor example, when I first moved to Australia it threw me off when people would use so many emojis and exclamation points in texts and DMs. I've just gotten used to the fact that it's how a lot of Australians write messages - it's a cultural thing and doesn't mean Aussies are more enthusiastic and manic than anyone else.\n\nNone of these girls have ever crossed a line or explicitly let me know they have a problem, it's just been a culmination of months of communication that always leaves me thinking \"Is this person mad at me or something?\"\n\nAt the same time, I recognize that my *own* personal and cultural nuances can rub others the wrong way. I certainly fit a lot of negative American stereotypes: I can be domineering in conversation, loud & overconfident, and my sense of humor is much more of the broad American style then the witty and subtle British style. \n\nI find it hard to keep up with the quick sarcasm & banter at times, especially with foreign accents, so I may come across to people who don't know me as humorless or even dumb in the wrong situation.\n\nOne of my biggest work flaws is time management - while I'm good at most things, I'm occasionally bad at meeting deadlines and that can really piss some people off. I'm open about it and I'm working on it.\n\nThe weird thing is before Sydney went into lockdown I did interact with one of the girls in person a fair bit and she didn't come across rude at all. We don't have much in common and conversations were generally pretty surface level small talk, but I never got a weird vibe.\n\nBut when working from home her communication online always leaves me uncomfortable and feeling like I've pissed her off somehow.\n\nI mentioned this problem to my wife (also American) and she said that she has a coworker exactly like that who also happens to be British. So it got me thinking that maybe this is just a cultural misunderstanding.\n\nSo my questions are: if I'm just misinterpreting cultural differences, is there anything I should do or should I just let it go? If this isn't a British thing and it sounds like I've actually rubbed some coworkers the wrong way, how can I improve the relationships while only interacting online? I feel like confronting the issue head on is a very bad idea, for a number of reasons.\n\n**TL;DR: I'm American and I have social anxiety. Three separate coworkers - all British - come across as rude in communication and I worry they have a problem with me. Am I misinterpreting a culture difference in office communication styles or is this an actual cause for concern?**",

    "text": "[Early-Mid Career] Should I take a job offer in industry or remain with a consulting firm?  I am currently deliberating over a job offer to work for a publicly-traded Midwestern utility, or remain at a small, fairly academic consulting firm. I am thirty years old and have no children (nor plans for children). My goal for the next decade is to grow my career into something both stable and lucrative.\n\n**Here are the salient points from my resume:**\n\nBachelor's degree in Economics from the University of Wisconsin  \nMaster's degree in Economics from the University of Wisconsin  \n1+ year working as an Economist for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington, DC  \n5+ years working as a private sector Economist, consulting for North American utilities  \nExperience testifying as an expert witness  \nOne published paper in a peer-reviewed journal, several other published reports\n\n**List of Important Points**\n\n* Benefits of staying where I am: I like my current job. I do interesting work, have a decent work/life balance, and have thus far received a good education from my coworkers, who are both smart and friendly.\n* Problems with staying where I am: I have concerns about the future of my current energy practice, as many current experts are already beyond retirement age. While the senior managers inform me that \"I am the future of the practice,\" I'm concerned that I don't have enough experience to win projects. I'm uncomfortable with the burden of building the practice with relatively limited experience. I am also concerned that one of my areas of expertise is falling out of favor among utilities, which would mean I'd need to find something new to work on.\n* Benefits of leaving: Changing jobs, and working for the utility, would give me the opportunity to see how the finance division of a large utility operates (what are their core business problems? how do they think about these problems). If I can get promoted within the company, I could gain valuable leadership experience that I might not get as a consultant. I could see myself returning to consulting in 5-10 years with the experience I gained.\n* Downsides to leaving: An investor-owned utility would have significantly more bureaucracy than my current job. Possibly less of an intellectual environment. I'm also leaving coworkers that I like for coworkers that I don't yet know. Additionally, the office is twice as far from my house, meaning I would not be able to bike to work regularly once office work returns (both jobs are currently remote, though both claim they will continue to offer hybrid work \"after the pandemic\").\n* The offer is a 12% raise from my current salary. I informed the president of my company that I may leave, and I was told that they would provide a counteroffer. I do not yet know what that will be. Relative to my former classmates who do consulting, I think my firm pays me less--possibly 20-30% less--than other consulting firms. But, I live in a lower cost of living city and I am currently not willing to move to a big city.\n\nThe question I keep asking is: should I take the raise at the utility and try something new? Climb the corporate ladder for a while and see what it's like on the inside? Is it unwise to be a consultant your whole life (does working in the industry lend more credence to a consultant's CV than a lifetime of consulting?)? Or, is my desire to leave my current job based on unjustified fear?\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this kind of dilemma?",

I've taken some really great courses in my degree that I'm fascinated about, such as the Internet of Things and Digital Circuits.\n\nBut then there's courses in my degree I'm doing poorly at such as Electromagnetics and Linear Systems and they feel like such a drag to me and I'm worried I'm going to fail them (so the Systems and Circuits and Engineering Sciences aspect of EE don't interest me essentially).\n\nThere's then an Industrial and Systems Engineering major here that seems to peak my interest and it's really easy to switch into it. I would also pair it with what we have as a Internet of Things minor, which is literally the aspect of EE I want to pursue.\n\nAdditionally, our school has a BS + MS program, and I was thinking between Computer Engineering, Financial Engineering, and Product Development Engineering as my MS choices if I decide to apply for this program.\n\nThe problem is I'm unsure if I want to switch to ISE.\n\nI'm interested a lot in the intersection of Business and Engineering, and Engineering Management. I want to create and scale my own start-up one day. I want it to be something with hardware, such as a human wearable hardware company like smart watches, but wearable tech more integrated beyond what we currently have. Or there's career goals I'm interested in like being an IoT Architect, Big Data Engineer, Data Consulting since I like traveling a lot, Systems Engineering Manager, etc.\n\nI'm also doing two research positions on Computer Aided Discoveries for Digital Circuits, and another one in Data Science, specifically image Machine Learning in which these applications I'm working on is actually used by our county for homelessness adaptions. Both of these research positions really interest me and I would see myself working on one of these fields happily!\n\nI'm also a bit worried if I switch. At my school, ISE is considered the \"Escape pod\" engineering major for those that bail out of Bioengineering, ChemE, Comp Sci, any other Engineering major really, but then again people make more fun of those that drop out of the Engineering school altogether. I get it's my happiness over others people perceptions, but I would probably feel extreme FOMO; feeling like I \"weeded\" out of ECE.\n\nI'm not exactly sure if ISE would fit my goals, even if I were to complement ISE with the IoT minor and a CompE Masters.\n\nLike I'm very hands-on geared, I enjoy toying around with Raspberry Pi's and Arduino Boards. I know ISE is very practical and makes you question \"how can I do things better\" which would be great when it comes to creating my own business and problem solving, but I'm not sure how \"hands-on\" ISE is.\n\nThere's also the facet of having to graduate a semester, or even a year later if I do ISE. I get there's nothing to be ashamed of in graduating after the atypical 4 years, but for me as a first-generation college student and American citizen, and low-income, my parents are facing financial insecurities and I would honestly just love to get my degree ASAP, get a job and get my parents out of the ghetto, and into a stable household where they and I can finally live comfortably so that's a factor that's weighted more for me than most people.\n\nIn essence, I'm not sure what to do with my life, prospective profession and with my college career and experience. Considering the synopsis of my college experience and sentiments to date, what would y'all recommend for me? Any insight would be extremely appreciated.",

This would be to learn more about how the main Corporate office conducts launching new programs and about a particular product that is new to the North American Plant I work at. \n\nI understand that at 4 months on the job that this would be a considerable offer.

    "text": "How to get first job as swe: two cents from an \"experienced\" FANG engineer Hello,\n\nI am \"experienced\" software engineer at FANG with 5 yoe. Experienced is in quotes because five years isn't whole lot, but I'm definitely not new grad anymore. I've given dozens of interviews, was a manager for couple of years in my previous company, and met with hundreds of job seekers at career fairs. This subreddit was great when I was looking for new jobs, but it seems now more than ever saturated by either new grads or students, so wanted to give some perspectives on how to get that first job. Everything is my personal opinion, and will be geared towards people looking for entry level swe positions.\n\nSo you've been applying. You've had few bites here and there, but no real offer yet. Some people say job search is numbers game, which is true, to an extent. But if you spend some time introspecting on what you are lacking, then you can hugely improve your odds. There are three main components to job search: your resume, people skill, technical interview skill.\n\nFirst your resume, this is your foundation. If the foundation is solid, it will make your job searching that much easier. You can tell your resume is lacking if your callback rate is low. If your resume isn't the best, then your focus should be improving this. Because it doesn't matter how good of engineer you are or master leetcoder, if you never get an interview in first place to able to show them. Formatting and wording is important, but what I usually look for when looking at resumes of new grads is whether they have internships or significant personal projects. Internship is usually better than personal projects, but if you are having hard time getting internship or it doesn't work with your timeline, then spend couple of months making personal project or, better yet, getting a group of friends to do a project and join hackathons. This not only boosts your resume but also gives you talking points in your interviews. 80 percent of the companies will ask you to tell them about something you built.\n\nNow the personal skills. Or as I would like to call it, do you know how to function in a professional setting. If you pass the resume screening (and online assessments) first step is usually a recruiter call. They are looking for red flags and whether you are really interested in their company. So smile, look engaged, and most importantly sound excited for the opportunity. Do some research about the company beforehand, ask meaningful questions and not something like \"is the lunch free?\"\n\nLastly the technical assessment. This is the most dreaded part for most people. Alas, there isn't a golden bullet here. You just have to grind. Grind leetcode, hit the books, and you will get better eventually. But be sure to leetcode intentionally. Meaning you don't always look at solutions after being stuck couple of minutes. If you had to look at a solution to solve a question, then try redoing it right away or the day after, you will be surprised how many questions you've done before you can't do anymore, this just means you didn't truly master the concept, so take it as sign to study more.\n\nLastly, learn from your failures. Unless you are very lucky or all star new grad from Stanford with 5 internships, you will fail your first interviews. The company will also never tell you what the issue was, so spend time on your own what you think went wrong. Was it technical question? Did you say something wrong? Were you too nervous? Debrief with your friends and mentors. And pat on yourself on the back, because that just means you just got that much better at interviewing.  Think of it as getting exp points in interviewing skills. Also remember that luck plays a huge factor in interviews. So keep trying and don't talk rejections personally. Learn from them and eventually you will have an offer.\n\nHope my perspective will be helpful to at least some of you. Feel free to ask me any questions in the comments. I'll answer all of them.\n\nEdit: If you could do me a favor and ask your question as a top level comment, that would make it easier for me to find you. Thank you.\nEdit2: Adding a couple of caveats here, I'm an American so some suggestions might not be as valid in your home country. Also it's for someone looking for a general SWE engineer role, so for breaking into specific industry like AI, embedded, etc, the process is a bit different.",

    "text": "Should I pursue my career as an engineer or go to college as a teen Hey I want some advice in my situation.\nIm currently a high school student(17) in Japan working full-time at a SaaS company as \na web developer(contract) while going to an online school. Im fluent in Japanese and English so school and work is okay communication wise. Im coming up to my senior year in high school and I need to make a decision wether if I should go to college or pursue my career as an engineer. I put a lot of thought to it and it’s a really though call, both point in my opinion are valid.tho I have many many things to learn and will face a lot of hardships I believe I have some skills.\nlet me introduce you to my background.\nI was first introduced to programming when I was in sixth grade(12) when I got my first laptop.\nit was a used old laptop but It was intriguing. I loved technology and having a computer was my \nbest gift ever. My mom introduced me to a robotics club short after tho I didn’t understand what I was doing I enjoyed making robots using Ardino. After I got into middle school I didn’t do any programming for a while. But I was interested in operation systems and hacking, I watch YouTube videos and had some fun. \nOn the last year of my middle school I went to a coding bootcamp. Thats when I learned javascript, I made some cool and simple project as well as doing a little bit of game creation with unity. Since I live in Japan and go to a Japanese school I had to take a test to go to a school of choice. School wasn’t really a thing for me, I didn’t like the system of it so I epically failed. \nAfter failing my test and my mom very disappointed in me I went to a pretty famous online high school with a good system to give me a lot of free time.So when enrolled I took a lot of web development courses via my school and Udemy. I made many projects and, It was honestly fun and I enjoyed something for the first time that gave me skills. After three or four month I went to a lounge meetup with some engineers. \nThere I met my mentor Nate who worked at a FAANG level company. \nHe was a really cool guy.\nHe took me under his wings letting me work as an intern teaching me and helping me build a path for being an engineer while getting paid to help with his project.After a year or so my internship ended so I decided to give it a shot and submitted my resume to a company posted on indeed. And luckily a company hired me. \nI was pretty impressed with my self because I didn’t use any connections and was able to pass my interview at this company. \nAnd it leads to now. \nI’ve been working little over a month now and I have learned so much. And my adaptability was tested since the framework changed from \nReact to Vue and it was a docker based project.\nI needed some time but I managed to get used to it. I have gone through a lot and Im enjoying what I’m doing a lot. But I just don’t know If I should go to college. People say its only 4years give or take but 4 years for a person in their early 20s sound a lot for me. Not only that but it cost almost 100k witch is just crazy. I asked on quora and many people answered I should go to collage because my pay will get better or I will get a better role but I wasn’t sure if that applies to the programming industry. Im just stuck here and need advice. Thank you\n\nEdit: I probably confused some people. I’m in Japan because I have dual citizenship, us and japan. I’m Japanese/American. Sorry for the confusion 😓😓 I can go to the USA citizenship wise and planning to go after high school.",

    "text": "Self-taught SWE increasingly worried about not having a CS degree Obvious throwaway. I know there are many posts like this, but many lack detail and as a result their responses lack nuance. I’ll do my best to keep this somewhat brief, though it’s difficult. I’ve outlined my background, my skills, and my qualms about what the next step is in my career at this time.\n\n**tldr:** Late-20’s, self-taught, 4 YOE, decent salary and skills, afraid of becoming redundant or being passed over for leadership positions down the line. Should I go broke for the next 3…5 years and pursue a CS degree while there’s still  “time”?\n\n**Background:**\n\nI’m a relatively successful, self-taught Software Engineer in my late-20’s living in a major American city not named San Francisco or New York. While I did spend some time coding in my teen years, I only really have about 4 YOE give or take a few months.\n\nBy relatively successful, I mean that thanks to some shrewd networking and decent interviewing I’ve been making \\~100k base salary for a little over two years now. I’m definitely grateful of that, as I’m aware there’s people making a lot less with a lot more YOE (and with a degree to boot). Not here to complain about money. I got lucky and picked the right technologies at the right time (React around late 2016-early 2017 thanks to YouTube, Udemy, and Reddit) and was able to cash in as there wasn’t much competition in my area for that skill and the demand was pretty high.\n\n**Skillset:**\n\nToday I work as a full-stack Node dev, though recently I’ve become more impassioned and interested in building native mobile applications. I’ve been self-teaching iOS and backend Kotlin (with an eye for learning Android development at some point in the future) through quarantine and my progress has been stellar. I’ve been shipping applications and bringing my ideas to fruition.\n\nLikewise, I’ve been supplementing those skills with some DevOps knowledge (AWS, Terraform, Docker, etc.) while deploying the server side components of my applications. All in all, that's going really well and I think I do a really good job of teaching myself new and relevant concepts.\n\n**The problem:**\n\nAs I progress through my career, I’m becoming increasingly worried about not having a degree. While I know many senior and lead developers/engineers without one, I’ve never actually met an executive, manager, or even an architect, without the proverbial “stamp” of a bachelors in a STEM field.\n\nRecently, the company I work for has undergone a hiring surge, and my direct manager (who was not at the company when I was hired) has decided to include me in the hiring process. Being on the other side of the hiring process has opened my eyes to how often candidates with non-traditional backgrounds are cast to the shadow realm, so to speak. Understandably, this has made me quite anxious about my future. Especially with the shift to remote work for most companies, talent pools across the industry have just expanded many times over which puts me at a huge disadvantage against formally educated developers/engineers in other parts of the world who will work for far less compensation. I imagine this will only get worse as time goes on and I try to obtain any sort of leadership position.\n\nI come from a highly impoverished background (think government housing, extremely high-crime rates, and immigrant parents to boot…) and suffice to say this is probably the primary reason I haven’t got a degree. Through my early adulthood, I had to deal with tons of trauma from my upbringing, had to kick several bad habits (been totally sober for a few years now — feels great), and had to escape a toxic family environment.\n\nI write that to say, I have zero safety-net. I can’t move back into my family home and go back to school. I’d have to seriously downsize (probably rent a room and live with multiple roommates to cut down on cost). Additionally, I’d have to pay for school out of pocket as I don’t qualify for any government benefits due to my salary over the past few years. If I blow through savings too quickly, I essentially risk ending up homeless.\n\nThankfully, I’ve saved up a pretty decent amount of money to this point and homelessness is not a concern. I’ve completed all my gen-eds at a previous stint in community college (except for Trig, Calc I - III, and Diff. Eq.) so essentially my path to a degree is 3 to 4 semesters at a CC, then transfer to some state university and probably spend 2-3 years there working on attaining a BSc in CS.\n\nMost people in the industry I’ve mentioned the latter to think I’m batshit crazy. Most say it’s too late and I’m too deep into my career to go back to school. Others say I’d be essentially sacrificing whatever equity or leverage I’ve amassed in my career thus far for a degree that may or may not provide the career advancement I think it will. Are they right? Are my concerns about not having a degree unfounded? I feel I’m at a really crucial juncture now considering world-events and if there ever was a time to go back to school, it’s right now. Or perhaps I’m wrong? My gut instincts are seriously failing me here. I’m at a loss.\n\nI apologize for the long read. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.",

    "text": "Laid off from FTE now they want me back as a contractor  \n\nI was laid off my FTE job last December after 10 years (VERY LARGE American telecom firm) due to a reduction in force. They told me I can come back as a contractor in 6 months. My previous pay was 105k a year + about a 5% year incentive bonus and included decent healthcare/401k/stock options.\n\nThe phone rang the other day with my old manager and director telling me to come back and offering $85/hr w2 through a contracting firm that would pay via w2. I asked them about benefits and whatnot and they said \"ask the contracting firm\", indeed/glassdoor tells me these benefits are crap and you dont get paid for days off, no 401k match, etc. I asked them about \"exclusivity\" (ie i can work another contract at the same time) and they said no. To me it sounds like they want me back as an employee with all the loyalty that comes with it but are not giving it back. Also, the contract is year to year and I have to get a renewal with them each year.\n\nSo with that whats the pros/cons with going back to my old job this way? Seems like a shit sandwich deal for me but great for them. Am I missing something or is this offer garbage? I have seen a lot of peers go down this path but I am not sure why - maybe because the company is all they ever knew.\n\nMy skillset is very marketable and I have another FTE job I am working now that is paying 130k + 10-15% bonus with all benefits, 401k matching, stock options, etc. I am think I would be a moron to walk away from this for a contract gig at my old employer who let me go out the door.",

    "text": "Got conned into a wrong job and don't know what to do to get out of the situation So I graduated in the middle of the pandemic and couldn't land a job for 7 months. Finally got a role at a small company in a Illinois suburb. In the interview they made it seem that they already had engineers at this office whom I will be working with, they said the current engg team is small but they plan to hire more people and that they currently have a larger offshore engg team in India. Now I had read some negative reviews about this offshore team and the CTO but I figured I will only deal with them occasionally and will mostly just be working with the team here in the US. \n\nBoy was I wrong, I come to my first day at work (yes they are working from the office every day, during the pandemic) and I find that there's literally just one other woman in the \"engg team\" who joined a couple of months before me and has no prior work experience, I have 2 years of experience and about 1.4 months of experience as a software developer, working in C, C++ and JavaScript Web Dev, current job is a Java Server Faces full stack role, a framework I have no prior experience with. The people in the American office while friendly are all just Sales and Platform Support. I was not excited about this company but decide it would be okay for like a year or so before I get a better job.\n\nThen when I finally had a meeting with the CTO and the Offshore engg team and I lost all hope for this job. It turned out to be a really negative and down right disrespectful and condescending bunch of people. The CTO is a micromanaging maniac who preys on desperate new grads and then puts them through the grinder until they quit within a year, there's only 1 engg on the devops \"team\" (just 2 people, one of which is a new grad like me) who has stayed for 3 years but she is related to the CTO so of course. I am expected to spend 2 hours or more every night to train with a offshore team member and join their daily standup, they expect me to work all day even on weekends and I am berated on every standup about not getting familiar with the framework and their code base fast enough. The CTO insults me and the other woman on my \"team\" about not being as productive as their offshore engineers who have worked at the company for many years and have the benefit of actually working with senior devs in person. According to him someone having a Master's degree should automatically be as good at their specific code base as a senior engineer, even if they have no prior experience. \n\nI have been at this company for less than a month but already I am feeling quite depressed and stuck. I feel I cannot even begin to apply for a new job for at least 5,6 months without it becoming a red flag on my resume, but I don't want to ruin my mental health over the next 6 months working with such people. I feel like I have barely any time left outside of work. They have given me a study project to do to learn the JSF framework but I barely feel any interest towards it, because no matter what I do they keep moving the goal posts and criticize how I code it, even though I am just following the tutorials available online and I have no help here. \n\nI even had to manually setup the work laptop on my own and I am still dealing with the clusterfuck of a codebase that they have, outdated codebase with not even Maven for dependency management, no Git, using SVN for version control, with junior devs having to submit patch files for seniors to verify and check in manually, no Test or Dev environment for devs to test their code changes, the source code has hardcoded paths for so many config files and dependencies that you have to manually figure out and fix from the console errors, have to setup everything locally including the database, also database changes almost every day and requires you to download a SQL dump file shared in a email and run it on your local DB to get the latest changes. I have no idea if the skills I learn here (JSF, PrimeFaces ) will even help me in the future since it seems to be an old and outdated framework compared to Spring.\n\nWhat should I do to get out of this situation as fast as possible. Should I start applying to jobs while keeping this job off my resume or wait for a few months and then add this job to my resume and then start applying. Should I personally contact recruiters/ hiring managers through LinkedIn or stick to blindly applying through job portals. I can dedicate a hour or so every day to LeetCode, but the thing that has led me to failing to crack interviews a lot is DB and Architecture design, as I don't have a lot of experience with those areas and don't know how to prepare for them.",

    "text": "What should I work for next? I have 1.5 year experience in QA (automation). My academic background is in biological sciences (I have a master degree) and then I did a bootcamp in web development (Java, Javascript) and found this job. I started taking classes from a bachelor in computer science from an online university last year and doing it part time. \n\nIn my job I work with Selenium (not directly, the company has an internal framework that uses Selenium) and Cucumber and write the tests in Java. \n\nI feel like I am at a point I am learning more about business rules than about technology and this worries me because it will limit my progression inside this company and I am not sure how much more I can make here. \n\nMy current salary is 15.000€/year and I'll get a small raise which will pump it to 16.000€/year (net). I am not american, I am in Europe, as you might have guessed from the euro symbol lol. For my country this is slighty above the salary average, but in IT I'd say it's not a lot. In this company I don't work more than 8h/day, sometimes even less and they let me attend the exams from college and pay the day. However I feel like they don't give much importance to my work. Manual testers and developers and the analysts are the most important. I also asked to take a preparation course in ISTQB and they didn't even reply to my email yet explaining how I can enroll in the platform with the company license.\n\nSo what I am looking for is to increase my salary to at least 18000€/year (I already have a stable work contract and this company almost never fires people, so I have a certain stability I am not willing to let go easily) in a company that allows me to learn new things, pays new training and most importantly, that does not ask overtime. I am not willing to work more than 8h/day. \n\nI am not sure which path I should work for:\n\n- Stay in this company and in this client and if I do so, the advantage is stability but I think the best role I could aim for would be analyst. I already said I would like a development role but the company won't take the risk to move me. \n\n- Change to a different company for a QA role \n\n- Change to a different company (or if this company allows it, change client) for a developer role. \n\nSo if I change company the disadvantage is the unstability, but potentially I'll make more. However I don't know if I'll like the managers, if the projects are crap, if they ask overtime and everytime someone changes company there's a trial period of 6 months in which they can fire someone with any warning. In my current contract they have to warn me 2 months before or pay those 2 months so it's a bit harder to fire. I am also already integrated in the project and perform well. \n\nIf I stay in this company and client, the advantage is stability. I already know they don't ask me a lot of overtime so I have time to study. But I doubt I'll be able to make much more or learn much more. \n\nThe other possibility is I stay on the company but change client. In this situation I don't think they'd raise me, but if I changed projects maybe I'd go to a different role and learn new things. \n \n\nSo I think there's two main questions here:\n\n- Should I work for certifications in QA or should I change for a development role? There's more positions for development and the salaries and raises are also higher for developers than for QA. However if I switch, chances are at least in the first year I won't make more than I am doing now because I'd be a junior in development. Conversely if I stick to QA maybe I can make more but then I am not sure I can progress much more than that in the long term... \n\n- Change company or stay in the same company and eventually try to change role either inside the same client or move to a different client.",

(Though they all say that I suppose during interviews if they need you)\n\nPro's:\n\n\\- Big, well established company\n\n\\- Good pay\n\n\\- Close to home\n\n\\- Growth opportunity (if true)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCons:\n\n\\- In the beginning it will be manual testing (i'd probably automate it after I get a good grasp of the system with selenium\n\n\\- It's a 1 year contract, common in my country but they are basically removing manual testing next year and replacing it with  an automated system (so the job is probably gone after a year and so will I or maybe not why would a company put the effort in to pay a junior so much to kick em out after 1 year)\n\n\\- It's an american company, meaning most of my team will be remote, could be harder to learn from others?\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe second job is pretty far away (3 hours of travel in total) and it's a junior fullstack position. The pay is alright but this seems like a company that REALLY wants to get a beginner and teach them everything they need. They give 1 month of training, pair you up with another dev for month 2 to teach you more stuff and then you go on your own and well... work.\n\nPro's:\n\n\\- Exciting to see a company put in so much effort to teach a junior, probably doing it to get cheap labor even in the interview they were very hammered on... how can you make us feel assure you won't leave soon\n\n\\- Employee's seem cool when I went there \n\n\\- It's a dev job which is what I do want in the end\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCons:\n\n\\- 3 hours of commute daily, yea it's 50/50 home/office but still\n\n\\- It's fullstack I personally don't really care much about front end and I currently know maybe 5% of front end so it would be an uphill battle\n\n\\- Well... burning a bridge with the other company since I sort of already accepted but this came last minute",

It’s a shit show\n\nWe work our asses off to get good grades, work for an extra 30 units to be cpa eligible, network like crazy, then we work hard to pass the cpa which is arguably one of the hardest certifications, and finally we grind 70+ hours under incredible stress... \n\nI thought it was worth it. I was the tough guy in school saying he can work 70+ hours and it was all worth it. \n\nI don’t know anymore. I’ve watched my friends mental health deteriorate. Ive watched my own normal happy self get depressed. I’ve watched people almost collapse from stress (not exaggerating). Some of my friends don’t eat much anymore. Some friends have put on a ton of weight.... It’s not uncommon to get yelled at or cussed at for doing tasks incorrectly.... they tell you to bill all your time worked, but then say, “watch the budget. Only charge x hours.” And forget being a high performer- it just makes managers and seniors give you more work and responsibility. Oh you got better reviews? Enjoy an extra 150 bucks in your bonus check!\n\nBeing a first year and learning virtually is horrible. It’s hard to get clear explanations. My soul is dead. I’m hurting and it hurts to see my friends and other first years suffering. Corporate America and public accounting doesn’t give a fuck about anyone’s health, but why should it? We’re all part of the game just trying to live the American dream and work hard for a pretty penny, right?  These firms won’t hesitate to cut any of us... \n\nIs it worth it? Is it really? Sure, busy season is only 4 months a year, but that 4 months is beyond brutal. \n\nProps to the people who can make it, but can we please stop wearing 80 hour weeks as a badge of honor. Working away your life and not enjoying the normal pleasures of life for a slightly above average salary is not a flex, it’s crazy talk.\n\nI’m finishing my last two exams this summer and getting out and I encourage everyone on the fence to really re-evaluate. I heard there’s accounting jobs with normal hours and more pay than public and I’m trying to find them.\n\nThanks for listening, good luck finishing busy season, and don’t forget to drink enough water. \nAlways remember that there’s more to life than work. :)",

    "text": "A Look Back At Accounting Advisory Services **TL;DR** \\- I've broken this post up into sections as it's a long read. While public has its faults overall I would say was a net positive on me and my career. AAS I would highly recommend and it worked out well for me working on transactions. Skip to the end to see the exit ops.\n\nEarlier this Fall I accepted an offer in industry and left Accounting Advisory Services at a B4 (e.g. EY FAAS, PwC CMAAS) and wanted to share a reflection on my time in the service line to shed some light for others contemplating joining or currently navigating the service line.\n\n# Background\n\nI graduated from the flagship public state school of my state with a bachelors in accounting. I was fortunate to get a full time offer at a national firm despite having a low GPA, for public anyway, of 3.0 and missing out on internship season the summer right before my Junior year. Part of that was due to spending time on a collegiate team that was a benefit to my resume based on leadership experience that I gained.\n\nI already covered my audit experience in-depth in another thread which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6en96b/my_experience_in_audit/) I won't go in-depth there. I will just say that between the two firms I was at the national firm had much better tech and easier intranet and internal resources to navigate but that the B4 had a few more technical resources. Additionally, I think the experience I got at a national firm was more insightful than the B4 audit experience that many of my AAS colleagues had gotten and from what I observed assisting a handful of audit teams at the B4 I was at. Since the teams aren't as built out at the smaller firms and you need to not just understand a singular part of the audit/financial statements but you need to know how it interplays with other areas of the audit AND you generally get to see more areas instead of being on one section of the audit and learning nothing else but how to audit one section of the financial statements.\n\nAfter 3 busy seasons of audit, one of those as a senior, I was starting to get tired of audit and at the same time I got a cold call from a recruiter at what would be the next firm I would work at which was perfect timing. I only got that call because I had my LinkedIn updated. So I would say keep your resume AND LinkedIn up to date regardless of whether you are/aren't looking. If possible, it's better to leave on your terms because you got a better offer than because you can't stand it anymore or worse you don't have a job.\n\nFrom there I got an interview that was mostly behavioral, I gave some vague examples that I've worked on technical topics and how I work on teams etc. I was a good candidate having 2-3 years of experience and was coming in at a time when ASC 606 and ASC 842 were both about to be widely adopted by public companies who would need AAS assistance on implementation. After about a 3 week process I got an offer for a 20% bump on a non-promotion year. Wanting to still further my career but without much knowledge about where I wanted to go next other than I wanted to be out of audit, I accepted the offer. I left my old firm that summer as an S1 (before year-end reviews were completed) and joined the new firm as an S2 in AAS, so kept on the same promotion track. In general I would say I was an above average performer but certainly not THE top performer. My ratings in general can be characterized as a 4 out 5 where 5 is the top rating.\n\n# Accounting Advisory Services Experience\n\nAfter joining I spent about 3 months on the bench which was typical back then because the firm was hiring in anticipation of a crush of work that hadn't come yet. And then out of the blue, and what I would later realize was an extraordinary stroke of luck I ended up on an SPAC transaction (this was in 2017 when SPACs were still generally an unheard of IPO route).\n\n**Learning**\n\nOn that first project I had no idea what I was doing as I had never substantively worked on a transaction. I learned a ton about what the terminology, SEC registration/proxy statements, and most importantly got plugged into a partner and senior manager focused on transactions. I would spend the next 2 years with a few holes here and there working with them mainly on IPO's. I personally found the work and process interesting. I used this as an opportunity to ask as many questions as I could so I could understand what was going on and why were doing what we were doing and inadvertently becoming a better technician in transactions not only in accounting but the whole deal in general (e.g. who were the other players and what did they do, what order does everything have to happen in, what hangups are there for the company and how can we help smooth those out if not avoid them altogether, etc).\n\nHaving this experience, as well as actually learning and eventually knowing what it was I was doing, I built a brand for myself as a transactions person. I'll touch more on this, but in general it became known that I had templates other teams could use or people with questions on IPO's/transactions could reach out to me with one off questions, this included people above me.\n\nMy time in AAS was effectively a crash course on SEC reporting, transactions and IPO's. I used it as an informal credential akin to if you could get an MBA in transactions. I learned to draft S-1's/S-4's, write business combination memos, complete purchase price allocation, run an IPO working group (e.g. lawyers, bankers, C-suite, accounting, auditors), and uplift financials/policies. At the time I still didn't know how it would be helpful long term but in the short term I was making myself more valuable to the firm and my teams and it set me up when I became a manager to be in demand at just the right time in 2020 when IPO's exploded. I had teams trying to get any amount of my time to the point that I was brought into some teams as an subject matter resource responsible for just the S-1 pro formas and ability to say no to the parts that were less sexy like unraveling the private company accounting mess.\n\nI say all this not only to give some context but also because there were many people who came in around the same time as myself for similar reasons, basically marking time in public unsure of what their next move is, who treated their experience more as a check the box experience. There's nothing wrong with that but if I had done the same I would have certainly had a different experience and possibly exit ops.\n\n**Service Offerings**\n\nThere are a basically three offerings in AAS - accounting change, transactions, and process improvement. Different firms call them different things but that's basically it.\n\nAccounting change includes helping clients with their adoption of new standards (e.g. ASC 606, ASC 842, and more recently CECL). This is the technical accounting piece where you're reading through the guidance, doing fact finding  to understand the fact pattern (e.g. contract reviews, interviews with accounting/operations/legal), and then writing a policy memo and drafting initial and recurring entries and training the client to do the go forward accounting.\n\nTransactions is fairly straightforward. You're helping clients account for their acquisition and/or IPO, drafting the business combination memo, aligning the accounting to the buyer's policies or to be public company ready and then helping the company post transaction either integrate the target or do their SEC reporting.\n\nProcess improvement is little bit newer and is sometimes dressed up as fancier names such as finance optimization or finance 4.0 but it's all the same. You're basically going into an accounting department that is either crazy inefficient, lacks people, has shown a pattern of misstatements or a mix of all of the above and figuring out how to streamline their accounting so they can close and report timely and accurately. It's a lot of explaining what can sometimes be basic GAAP concepts, updating/creating better templates, and training the accounting staff to do their job better.\n\nI preferred transactions as initially I vaguely understood it was more lucrative if nothing else making you more valuable to the firm on a rate per hour and later on because you learn so much not only about transactions but about getting companies shaped up for bigger and better things with wide access to many different functional areas. Process improvement, if it was the right project, can be interesting but I tried not to get sucked too much into this area. Accounting change I avoided like the plague. Once people know you have experience in an area teams want to pick you up for long spans of time to do one thing and you don't grow a professional. If I spent three years on ASC 842 it would only make me a great accountant for leases and not much else.\n\n**Firm Politics**\n\nBusiness, and especially public accounting, requires some level of politiking. Being in public and lasting for a while requires 2 of 3 things, be very likable, be a great technician, and/or know how to navigate the politics. As a senior the politics don't matter quite as much from a promotion standpoint, unless it's a down year. But being able to navigate the people in a firm can help you to 1) shape the type of experience you have and 2) clarify and or even influence your career potential in the firm. I know a lot of people want to be remote 100% and I get that driving to a client or flying for some is huge turnoff, but you do lose the networking aspect of public in a remote world. This is a tangible benefit both in the firm as long as you stay and outside of the firm once you leave. I don't think 100% in person is what we should/will go back to but some hybrid level, especially for the benefit of younger staff, is important in my opinion.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I connected by chance with people that could bring me into the type of work I wanted to be in. I also worked with a leader in my region's practice who I got along well enough with that they pulled me along later on into other interesting projects and someone who I knew would look out for me in terms of getting above average compensation and keep me on my promotion track when the firm was holding people back because of potential covid impacts they were anticipating. The latter relationship allowed me to push for more opportunities to manage my projects how I wanted and hand pick my projects and staff. While the original encounters were by chance, staying in touch, doing good work, and building a working relationship with them was big for making sure that I continued to progress.\n\nIn terms of types of projects, early on once I had gotten a taste of transactions and knew it was what I wanted to do I made it known that I was looking for transaction and work and communicated, even early on before I truly had significant experience, that I was a transactions person and that's what my specialty was. This allowed me to control my narrative in the practice and generally kept me off of the projects I wanted to avoid. Additionally, I started tracking who worked on transactions and would reach out to them before I became available in order to line up my next project when I started sensing that my current project was wrapping. The few times I ended up on non-transaction work it was because my projects ended abruptly (dead deal) or because there happened to be no openings within my network for my level at the time.\n\n**Work/life balance and Travel**\n\nI started in AAS pre-covid in 2017 when travel was still possible. Working in transactions, it was understood you would be on the road and I was about 60-80% of the time. As a young single person this was great. I got an expense account to charge meals to (and many great meals were charged to the client), I didn't have to do dishes or heavy cleaning, I built status reaching the top tier of the hotel/rental car/airlines I had picked (FYI pick Delta, United is meh and who would voluntarily pick American??), and I got to see some cool places including some international travel (which is rare even for AAS). I usually flew to the client on Sunday/Monday and flew home on Thursdays and worked.\n\nThe hours in AAS depend on the offering you're on. Transactions can be a lot leading up to filings, we're talking usually 80+ in the last 2-3 weeks leading up to an IPO but outside of those last few weeks it's traditionally been close to 45-50 hours with a lot of flexibility once your team trusts you of when you work/taking time off. Overall I would say I worked less total hours than audit. Of course post covid everyone is hurting for people and AAS is no exception so the hours are closer to 50 hours minimum but at some point as the staffing levels adjust things should settle.\n\n**Compensation**\n\nThe compensation is usually about 15%-20% higher than audit with the exception of internal transfers which most firms usually can get away with offering less. I would generally advise against internal transfers from a comp perspective as well as the fact that internal transfers often end up getting pulled into their old service line even after they transition.\n\nKnow your worth, check the comp threads for your area and ask your network what the going rate for your level is. I wish I had negotiated my initial offer into AAS as I think I could have gotten more.\n\n**Exit Ops**\n\nGenerally the exit ops are the same as audit (but quicker path) plus technical roles, lateral moves to FDD/transactions, project based accounting, strong MBA candidate (with a good GMAT of course), and for high performers possibly boutique IB.\n\nAdditionally, the promotion track is the same as audit, generally 2 years at staff, 3 at senior, 3 at manager, and 4+ at senior manager.\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\nOnce travel opens up, for those in AAS it will be important to relearn what the expense policy is. There are certain tricks, which vary firm to firm, when it comes to maximizing your experience. Things like can you use personal hotel cards to book travel vs your corporate card or can you shift your breakfast allowance to cover lunch, or using meal averaging to charge more on the non-travel days and grab something quick from the airport on travel days. Also, sign up for rewards programs with travel companies and stick with one vendor as much as possible.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nAAS, and public in general, is what you make of it. I found it to advance my career in a way that would have been hard to replicate in industry. Certainly there are many ways to be successful and success looks different to different people. But if you're trying to advance your career quickly, public is one of the most accessible and tested ways to do that for accountants and I would go further to say that AAS is an even better accelerant than audit as there's much more critical thinking involved vs compliance check the box activities.\n\nBe good to people, both above and below you, and it will pay dividends. Too many people let small things work them up in the moment when in reality it's not a big deal and certainly not worth torching a connection over. You never know when someone will be in a position to help you.\n\nTry to have your next goal in sight so that you can make decisions, even if small, that steer you towards the next opportunity.\n\n# Epilogue\n\nFor those curious, I left as an M3 for a Senior Manager Technical Accounting and Reporting role at a pre-IPO company. I was basically brought in to help take the company public, do the SEC reporting going forward, help them with uplift of their accounting  and special accounting projects. All things I already do for my clients.\n\nMy bump in base was 45% with a potential for annual bonus of +20% of my old base (a far cry from the 4-6% firms typically give) plus equity (which includes vesting clauses) in the amount of 450% of my old base before tax and after any buy-in cost. Right now if you have at least 3 years of experience the market is very hot. Just be careful to jump not only for money but also for the ability to grow as a professional.",

And take fucking history or human studies instead of more business classes? That is very predatory practice to get $$$ out of 20 YO kids.\n\nHere in Egypt, all public colleges give us more than 150 hours for CPA (According to people who went for it), seriously, your education system is predatory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe mentality of “BIG FOUR OR BUST” is just retarded, you will be fine without public experience if you don’t want to go the public route, no need for your mental health and body to tank just for “I WAS TOLD IT IS A CAREER SUICIDE IF I DON’T GET PUBLIC”, if someone succeeds in Public he would also have succeeded in Industry.\n\nFor some reason, people here think Accounting is one of two; Either B4 CHAD or AP Clerk virgin.\n\nI don’t know if you remember the post from that lesbian B4 woman with her “loser” girlfriend, but that is what a lot of people in this sub sound like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy advice to college people; work on your interpersonal skills this is the most important thing for your career progression,\n\nIf you have a hobby, keep doing it even if you’re tired after work, just to keep your sanity.\n\nHonestly, the best advice I could give to you is to fucking pay attention to your back, back pain is horrible, and I wish I paid attention to my posture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou don’t need other to tell you what path to take (Including me), you can do what you want and don’t worry about judgement, if you’re happy with doing bookkeeping, then do bookkeeping, if you don’t want to go public don’t, if you enjoy public accounting, don’t let people discourage you with “ oMg YoU dRaNk ThE kOoLaId”, do what works for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI’ll be replying to comment here from my main account u/moamr96 , feel free to ask me anything\n\nI tend to delete my post history every now and then (OCD), so I created this with another account to be a reference if someone searches this on the future.\n\nGood luck",

    "text": "Best way to input a credit card payment on Quickbooks Desktop? Usually, the method I was introduced to is making a big check on Quickbooks and listing all of the expenses underneath. So if its a check for 10K for American Express? Print out check for 10K, list the expenses underneath, so example repairs 2k, office supplies 2k, etc to where it all *exactly* equals 10K. This works 100% of the time.\n\nBut now the company has decided to use another credit card company, with three new credit cards for three different people in management. Unfortunately, the previous method doesn't work anymore. What will happen is, I will see an expedited DEBIT payment in May for 2K in our main bank account, which is paying down one of these cards. So I go ahead and clear this as part of my routine bank reconciliation. Then in mid June, I will see a new credit card bill with an amount due of $1900; it will list of a lot of transactions, but it *also* shows the 2K expedited payment from a month beforehand. Now, this throws off everything. It throws off everything because I have to make the payment for $1900; so everything HAS to equal 1900, which in its calculation includes the $2000 expedited payment (in the bill it shows as \"-$2000 thank you for previous expedited payment\"). What account do I put this $2000 for now? It's already been taken care of the bank recon so now I just have this extra 2k sitting there because it must, must equal 1900 when I print the check. This is all very confusing. \n\nSo what I'm what wondering is should the best method be to just create three **credit card accounts** for each of management, and use the bill function? Most of the time we just use checks and the bill function isn't used. But I'm willing to learn it if it makes this process smoother. Or is the best way to continue the American Express way and use the correct accounts?",

    "text": "Different Companies Depreciating PPE differently Working on a project now and wondering some of the incentives managers may have towards depreciating large assets under longer useful lives.  In my current project, American Airlines and Delta use 25 and 27 year useful lives for their planes, respectively. \n\nBy using a shorter Useful life, AA is able to recognize a higher gain on the sale of a plane, and Delta recognize a loss, assuming purchase price, sale price, and residual value are the same.  I can see the reasoning to use the shorter useful life, but why would a company opt for longer? \n\nMy thought is higher net income during the useful life in the period the plane is in use and then when the Delta Plane is eventually sold at a loss, it is marked down as unusual/infrequent and not included in normal income.   Thoughts?",

    "text": "Harassment at Work My Cousin (early 30s) was recently at her job by this older white guy (mid 50s). Mostly white workplace yet a few black coworkers she befriended and they come to her since she’s intelligent and people come to her type of way.\n\nMost of the times he would be the one to approach her to talk and gossip and at first it seemed like just talking with your coworkers. Then it became off as with how he tried to bring up discuss racial discussions. He said to not consider Black Americans her people (from Virgin Islands). Which was not his place to even say. He told her everyone has gone through things as he was Catholic and they were discriminated in the past.  He said in his own country he’s discriminated (although not even a recent immigrant...)\n\nThe breaking point was trying to address her as “my girl” and saying “my wife at work”. He would also turn conversations sexual...\n\nShe began ignoring him and distancing herself from him and then he approached her asking why she’s not talking to him.. She yelled at him to go.\n\nShe reported it to her manager and she designed her schedule so he wouldn’t have to come into contact with him. Though the manager was saying “Really?” as if he wouldn’t approach her sexually when she said what he said to her. The manager even said  Italians can be that way(???) and it may be a cultural thing. Like his parents may be immigrants why is that even a reflection off of him? And it’s Italian culture to overstep boundaries?\n\nI’m so mad I literally want to confront that man myself. Her assistant \n  manager never even said I’m sorry that happened to you or even addressed it like she doesnt\n gaf about her workers. The guy would even mess with this black guy at the job and deal with him differently. I feel like black women can be sexually harassed and no one would believe us because apparently no one want us. As if we’re not women.\n\n\nI changed details about age of cousin and this guy to not be explicit about their identities.",

    "text": "Feeling ugly and undesirable as a black woman. Hey everyone this is my first time posting on here and I'd like to ask for some advice. I'm a 25 year old black female going to school at a predominantly white college. I come from the Caribbean(Jamaica to be exact) where it's mostly black people and I'm having a really hard time making friends with other black people. It seems to me that the few black people who live in this neighborhood don't actually mess with other black folks especially the black men I come across. They tend to ignore you completely or if you speak to them they are very passive aggressive. I also noticed that when they speak they speak with a Caucasian American accent and for the most part every black guy I see only has white friends or they only date white women. I think this is kinda bizzare I'm not saying that people can't date who they want but it's so odd to see other unambiguous black people completely disassociate themselves from people who look like them. Idk how to explain how isolated I feel. \n     I do chemical engineering so my class is pretty much all white men I'm the only black woman in my class. There were 2 black guys in the class so I sat next to one of them hoping I could make friends. The teacher told everyone to partner up with the person next to you and he literally went out of his way to try to avoid me even though I was the one sitting closest to him. By the time I came to class the next time he had switched seats just to avoid me. I cant fully explained how worthless he made me feel. I was reading something on reddit where people were talking about an interview with Gabriel union. She said when she was young she would go out of her way to avoid other black people and only hang out with white girls. She said she didn't want to be looked down upon like the white girls looked down on black women so she would avoid them at all cost so she wouldn't be isolated by her white friends. This is the first time in my life I've ever come across black people who didn't like other black people. Don't get me wrong I don't expect you to be my new bff but at least don't treat me like I'm less than you. I feel like some of these black kids grew up in a predominantly white school so they don't have the same experience like other black people so they think they are above you or think racism is just all in your head. \n    My question is have any of you gone through this and do you have any advice for how to deal with microaggression from white people and having no solidarity with other black people. This morning I was driving to work and I saw a black girl in the car in front of me. When I looked on her bumper it was a ton of pro trump stickers......I feel like I'm in the Twilight zone cause nothing here makes sense. Btw I moved to Alabama without doing much research I was so happy to get accepted at a college that I didn't even think of the people there. Oh one last thing I was in the supermarket shopping for groceries a couple weeks ago there was a black guy with his white girlfriend standing in front of the milk I was waiting for them to move so I could grab a gallon for myself. And this dudes gf gave me the nastiest look when she saw me it was one of those looks like \"yah bitch Ik you're jealous of me\"....... But in actuality I not even mad he's with her neither do I have any desire for the guy she was with I was just trying to get some milk and they took forever to move... The black guys are passive aggressive and so are their gf's. I'm sorry this post is so long but I'm just so genuinely confused by it all. These days I feel so ugly and undesirable people having me feeling in some kinda monster people should avoid. This is my first time truly experience discrimination for my skin color so it's all so traumatizing idk how to manage it. 🥺 Please I need some help.",

    "text": "Gah that American \"math\" team post on the front page really bothered me. I get it, it's a casual joke. Asians tend to dominate math competitions. But more importantly, the sense that even though you're winning a competition for America and are American through and through, you're still a foreigner in your own country.\n\nIt used to drive me insane when people asked me \"where are you really from\". I'd want to reply well started in Alabama, moved to Chicago when I was still young before school, and now I work in New York. I would carry my passports out in airports like a badge of honor so people would know I'm \"american\". \n\nAnd it took me decades to unfurl the toxic defense mechanisms I spent my life throwing up. Growing up, I vehemently rejected Asian culture. I hated my name so I changed it legally. I beat the shit out of my body playing lacrosse at a high level because it was the whitest sport (all conference and even then I was known in the conference as the \"asian kid\" or the \"chinky boy with skills\"). I attended a fucking US military academy for a year instead of a top 5 school initially because I wanted to show the world how American I was. \n\nIt took me until 25 and working in Asia on projects for half the year to finally get it. To finally be in a place where the assumption isn't I'm a math guru or code monkey. Where my managing directors don't assume I'm a work horse and nothing more. Where instead of preparing the deck for sales meetings, I got to actual drive the meetings and lead. But more importantly, as I matured, I understood so much more about myself and why I am the way I am.\n\nI never realized how much growing up in the midwest as one of the only Asians in my school would impact my sense of self. My obsession with fitting in and being \"american\" led me to completely reject so much of what makes me well, me. \n\nThis current movement of Asians standing up for themselves and doing it together makes me so fucking proud. I now realize my history and culture isn't just that of China but it's about the workers brought here to build the railroads. The asian communities that popped up early on that suffered untold racism and abuse. The Chinese exclusion act and the Japanese internment camps are some of the most atrocious decisions by my country. But I'm so fucking proud to be part of that history. To know that the strength to endure untold hardship and sacrifice for the future generations flows through me and is part of my history and culture means everything. So thank you to all the activists and people stronger than me who push the narrative. You guys have made me so proud to be Asian American and my children will love and embrace their culture and heritage in a way I never allowed myself to. So thank you.",

I've asked this in a Korean-American community(more than 99% of them are 1st generation immigrants who were born and raised in Korea) and they said this is not because of racism but because 1) Asian Americans prefer remaining as an engineer rather than becoming a manager 2) 1st generation immigrants tend to lack the adequate English and communication skills to climb the corporate ladder. If they try harder to assimilate by hosting parties at their houses and watch American footballs, hockey, and basketballs(instead of soccer) and go out hunting with his or her colleagues, they will not be discriminated against at all. Also, he mentioned that Asian Americans born and raised in America do not face any institutional discrimination other than affirmative action because they understand American culture and are good with English.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you agree with these opinions? It's kind of interesting because Asian Americans born and raised in the States generally agree that there are some kinds of bamboo ceilings but 1st generation Asian Americans tend to argue that there is no racism in the States and the Asian Americans who face racism are either 1) lack the adequate manner 2) not fluent in English 3) very unlucky or 4) should blame their lack of adequate skills rather than racism.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you think the bamboo ceiling still exists?",

    "text": "What Was Your Favorite Childhood Food? Given the large number of negative posts (which is thoroughly understandable given the rise of anti-Asian rhetoric and violence going on in this country), I thought I would try to post something positive.\n\nI'm a 3rd generation ABC (American born Chinese). Although most of my relatives are doctors and attorneys, I became a teacher. I started out as an elementary teacher but after 17 years I burned out and went to culinary school. My father said I was having a mid-life crisis. After graduating and working in the food service industry for a few years, I returned to education as the chef instructor of a high school Culinary Arts program. I have now been teaching Culinary Arts for fourteen years.\n\nAlthough I grew up eating typical American breakfast foods i.e. bacon and eggs, pancakes, French toast, waffles, cereal, and oatmeal; one of my favorite food memories growing up was of my grandmother's sticky rice which we would often have for breakfast whenever we visited my paternal grandparents. Grandmother would steam glutinous rice and mix it with fried onions, crumbled hard boiled eggs, chopped Chinese sausages and other ingredients prior to wrapping it in banana leaves and steaming them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/om2oe3qj50o61.jpg?width=610&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86149a4e55c2e3627c03028b5edfb5254b78dcb7\n\nSince grandmother had very conservative views of gender roles, I wasn't allowed in the kitchen to watch her make these because boys had no place in the kitchen (according to her worldview). Since my sister and my female cousins had no interest in cooking, I'm sorry to say that grandmother's recipe was lost when she passed on.\n\nAlthough I have done my best to replicate her recipe, I've never quite managed to get the taste right.\n\nWhat I have managed to get right is the production of chicken congee, though my family typically called this \"jook\". It'd be hard to mess up a jook since it's nothing more than rice boiled to pieces in what is usually a flavorful broth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a06p6sap70o61.jpg?width=258&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e149b6db2b1029e48744a9ad0c8a81d1ee0fc1cd\n\nMy father preferred a plain jook with a garnish of green onions. In contrast, my grandmother always had a wide variety of toppings to add. These toppings included pork floss (yuk sung), fried dough, and all sorts of vegetables. I personally liked cracking a raw egg into the bowl and pouring the hot jook over the egg. The heat from the soup would soft cook the egg and the first spoonful would typically break the yolk. When drizzled with some light soy sauce and a touch of sesame seed oil, I thought this dish was heavenly.\n\nWhat are your favorite childhood food memories?",

    "text": "Ramen made with low carb Nasoya pasta Like many people, I've gained weight over the past year while in Covid lockdown and later in voluntary isolation. It didn't help that I had prostate issues and was wearing a catheter which largely limited my movement.\n\nAfter undergoing prostate surgery, my doctor gave me a complete physical prior to announcing that I was medically cleared to return to work. He also told me that I needed to lose weight and set a target goal of 50 pounds. I put myself on a low carb diet. Even though I don't exercise, I've managed to lose 7 pounds over the past three weeks.\n\nAs an Asian American, I really miss rice and pasta. Stir fried vegetables just don't seem to taste as good when they're not eaten over rice. I also miss chow mein, cheung fun stuffed noodles, steamed bao, and steamed dumplings; all of which I have typically made at home from scratch.\n\nTwo weeks ago I discovered Nasoya Pasta Zero Shirataki Spaghetti at my local WalMart. This low carb pasta is gluten free and is made from the root of the konjac plant. Also known as the konnyaku potato, devil's tongue, voodoo lily, snake palm, or elephant yam; the konjac is a Japanese root vegetable that's full of fiber. Nasoya sells this pasta in the refrigerated section of the produce department in 8 oz. packages. A serving of 2/3rds of a cup only has 4 grams of carbohydrates. In contrast, 2/3rd of a cup of spaghetti would have 28.35 grams of carbohydrates.  An equivalent amount of dried Ramen would have 26.6 grams of carbs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[konjac plant](https://preview.redd.it/jou608s157q61.jpg?width=785&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1187d2d6ac9aa50e880e4dc15aea7b3328de46ba)\n\nI used this pasta to make Ramen. The broth came from a Hakkas style braised chicken with red chilies. My soup included stir fried cabbage, sliced nori, steamed broccoli and cauliflower, stewed turnips and carrots, and chayote squash that was simmered in the broth. I also added a slice of ham, a hardboiled egg, and a garnish of green onions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vjl56elm67q61.jpg?width=576&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0740f42db033f2fbf606cf10dd520e5b67ae44e4\n\nThe konjac pasta was surprisingly tasty. Since I have largely been sticking to fish, lean meats and vegetables for the past three weeks, it was nice to once again enjoy some noodles even if it was just 2/3rds of a cup.",

    "text": "Male names face discrimination in hiring A report we created took together evidence and found that men generally face higher rates of discrimination in hiring when it comes to male vs. female names \\[1\\].\n\nHere are the research highlights:\n\nA male name is 13% less likely to be chosen than a female name for rental housing, and it goes as big of an anti-male gender gap as 33% in low-population areas for black male names vs. black female names (46% callback rate for men, and 79% callback rate for women) and male Muslim names are 50% less likely to be housed than female Muslim names. Comparatively, male names are less likely to be hired in female dominated jobs, and are 3.2% less likely to be hired than in blind hiring (vs. the 2.9% advantage women have). One study found that women were hired 2% less based off of their name, but it appeared to be biased, due to the fact that it only used 9 names and did not differentiate between lower class and higher class names. (If you look at the study you'll find that a male name, Jose Vazquez, had the highest negative response rate \\[13%\\] and nearly the lowest positive response rate \\[81%\\]. \\[2\\]) Female names are also possibly discriminated against in male-dominated jobs, as it depends on the job, for example a heavy-lifting job may be biased against them, but a STEM one is not (as they are biased towards 2:1 over EQUALLY or SLIGHTLY MORE qualified male candidates \\[3\\]).\n\n\\[1\\] Adams, Drew K.

    "text": "Emma Goldman Papers Public History Project In addition to Emma’s birthday on the 27th, June toasts many anniversaries:  a time of the solstice, of pride and of celebrated struggle. While we at the EGPPHP may be more familiar with Berkeley’s infamous June gloom fog, we envy the dry heat and choruses of cicadas and ice cream truck chimes of our eastern neighbors. In tribute to the beginning of the summer season, we thus offer our readers what we hope is a refreshing treat.\nDid you know that Emma Goldman was once the proprietor of not one, but two ice-cream parlors?\n\nShe and her comrade Alexander Berkman longed to participate in the shaping and promise of the early revolution in Russia. How the twenty-something year old Emma could raise money for passage seemed almost insurmountable. Wracking their brains they  conjured up a novel idea of opening an ice cream shop.  Even though she never overcame the fears of the Worcester locals who dared not have their children tainted by the presence of a  notorious anarchists in their midst, they managed to turn a profit. Surreptitiously, an entourage of teenagers snuck out of their homes and lined up to imbibe and luxuriate on Emma’s double scoops of chocolate and vanilla ice cream.\n\nThe first volume of our \ndocumentary edition, Emma Goldman: A Documentary History of the American Years: Made for America, 1890-1901**, documents her first foray into the ice-cream world: “...stirred by accounts of the tsar’s latest atrocities, [Sasha, Emma and Fedya] came upon the all-American idea of opening an ice-cream parlor to fund their return…[b]ut even double scoops could not secure a steady flow of cash, 0ff-season in a hot-weather business, thus dashing their hopes of joining the international supporters of the brewing revolution in their mother country”(Volume 1, p.22).**\nIn the January 16, 1954 issue of The New Yorker, the writer S.A. Behrman recalled visiting the Worcester, Massachusetts location of Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman’s first and successful ice-cream parlor and luncheonette, located at 86 Winter Street (Living My Life, p. 82). \n\n\"The counter was neat, and the blowzy-headed, benevolent deity stood behind it. When...asked ...what I wanted, I was tongue-tied; I fully expected some emanation from the apikorista to pulverize me...When it came—double scoop, twice what you would have got (in town) Miss Goldman left us, and we sat at the counter and ate.”(Behrman, 1954). While Behrman concludes his article with an admission that his recollection may have been a mere false memory, his piece provides a foray into the imagined space.\nA few years later, encouraged by their windfall, they ventured into the proprietorship of yet another ice cream shop--this time in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn--with much less success. Emma launched her second endeavor into the ice cream world in the Spring of 1895 (Volume One, p. 500). Alongside Claus Timmerman and Ed Brady, and with funding from Modest Stein, she opened a parlor in Brownsville, a prominent working class Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. The attempt was unfortunately short-lived: \n“It occured to me that we might try something like our ice-cream parlour in Worcester. It had been successful there; why not in New York? Ed approved of the project and suggested that we proceed at once… I had saved a little money, and Fedya offered us more. Friends advised Brownsville: it was a growing centre, and a store could be got not far from the race-tracks, where thousands of people were passing daily. So to Brownsville we went and fixed up a beautiful place. Thousands did pass by there, but they kept on passing. They were in a hurry to get to the race-track, and on their way home they had already visited some ice-cream store nearer the track… our daily receipts were not enough to cover the venture… Ed tried to laugh away our plight, but he was evidently unhappy. We gave up the business and returned to New York. In three months, we had lost five hundred dollars…”(Living My Life, p. 161).\n\nIn his excellent book, The Dairy Restaurant (Nextbook Press, 2020), Ben Katchor carefully tracks the meals, both eaten and prepared, by Emma: “Through the pages of Emma Goldman’s autobiography, we can chart her socio-political movements by the cafes and restaurants she visits”(Katchor, 280). These included not only establishments she patronized throughout the city and boroughs, including Sachs Cafe (on Suffolk Street), Joseph Knirim’s salon on North William Street, or the Zum Groben Michel Salon, but also Goldman’s very own Worcester and Brownsville parlors. \n\nIn Other News:\n 2021 marks the 150th Anniversary of the Paris Commune, March 18th-May 27, 1871.  Inspired, Emma Goldman often lectured about the significance of the Commune. Subsequently she befriended Louise Michel, communard and anarchist, while Michel was exiled in London. \"Ever since I had read about the Paris Commune, its glorious beginning and its terrible end, Louise Michel had stood out sublime in her love for humanity, grand in her zeal and courage…This…was the woman who had survived the savagery of the respectable Paris mob….she would die for the Cause”(Living my Life, p. 166). There’s a fascinating look at the artistic representation of the Paris Commune in Hyperallergic. \nL’Archive de Paris has several online exhibitions of ephemera and documents from the Paris Commune currently viewable. Also, an animated documentary film about the Paris Commune was recently created and broadcast for the sesquicentennial in France for Arte TV, Les Damnés de la Commune**.**\n📷\nFrom the EGPPHP office:\nWe at the Emma Goldman Papers Public History Project appreciate  your generous donations and continued belief in the value of our work.
