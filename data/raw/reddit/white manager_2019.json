    "text": "Does anyone else feel like there's still a lot of discrimination in the interview process? I've been interviewing for a lot of forward facing jobs and get the impression that how I look is causing me to be immediately rejected. The phone interview will go well, but when I meet the interviewers in person they have a very strange demeanor. You know when you go on a date with someone that clearly isn't interested? That's the exact feeling I get from the very start of most interviews, like they don't want to be there but have to at least go through the motions. I just finished an interview where the hiring manager didn't ask me a single question about myself, no follow up questions, and just seemed irritated that she had to be there. I can usually recognize when I'm just not a good fit for a job, but it seems like I've been encountering a lot of odd behavior lately. \n\nI live in a city that's 30% racial minorities, but it seems rare to actually run into POC in professional settings. I work in the nonprofit sector and most companies will put up pictures of their employees, and I've noticed that most places I apply to are almost exclusively young white (sorority type) women, with maybe a couple guys and one or two token minorities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, it still seems like there's a very subtle racial, gender, and age discrimination, like they wouldn't mind hiring someone \"different\" but will definitely choose the person that looks like them if everything else is equal. I was wondering if other people get that impression, or if I'm just being paranoid.",

    "text": "Graduated college but having trouble finding a good job. Should I join the military? I'm a 26 year old woman in Florida, I graduated with my Bachelor's of Science in Psychology exactly 1 year ago now. Before I went to University I worked for several years in cell phone sales and did alright but always wanted more for myself than to become a retail manager. I genuinely wanted to become a psychologist or a therapist but I underestimated how much school actually would cost me both financially and energetically--by the time I graduated last year, I was fully burnt out on the student life and 30k in federal student loan debt. I was eager to find a good job and start working and making money, and although I attended some job fairs at my University, I really did not see much that I really wanted to do or was qualified to do.\n\n Part of the reason I chose Psychology (instead of something more marketable like Health/Nursing or Technology) is because I have very, very weak math skills, but my reading/language skills are through the roof. I literally practically failed the math portions on the SAT/ACT but was in the top national percentile of the reading/writing/language portions of the tests, which is how I managed to even make it into college at all.\n\nSince I've been graduated I have avoided going back to typical retail jobs or jobs at the mall and tried to focus on more professional roles. I tried a call center job briefly during college (awful). I served as a substitute teacher for several months before I realized I don't actually want to be a teacher (the public education system is fucked right now, seriously) and it would ultimately cost me a couple thousand to get certified as a real teacher and recieve the pay and benefits (I have no money and no credit options, and no interest in taking out more loans). \n\nI decided to get certified to work in insurance so I studied for about a month, got a 4-40 license, and worked for a few State Farm agents. I can't even explain how ridiculous my experience with SF agents has been, the most weird employment where the businesses are failing or only a few years old yet the agents are only in the office a couple hours out of the day or don't come to work at all, yet are upset wondering why they are at the bottom in sales in the area. Weird office politics where there's one older person basically running the office for the agent and one spanish person to handle the spanish customers but otherwise extremely high turnover in the office. One office I worked for, the agent told me she had 30 employees come and go in the last two years, but had no idea why (because she was literally only in the office one day a week). A different agent convinced me to decline a job offer with a different company so I could be the only sales person in his office (more money for me and less competition) and then fired me two weeks later (over text message) after paying me half of what we agreed on and having no reason or explanation for what I did wrong besides \"you're just not a good fit\". I even asked for constructive criticism and he refused to give any. Very confusing, infuriating and weird! \n\nAt this point I'm just very frustrated, broke and losing hope in my job search. I always played with the idea in my mind of joining the military  to get some experience, structure, travel, benefits, etc. But if I'm being honest, I'm a hippie and I don't bleed red, white and blue like I know you probably should if you're going to serve. Still, the idea of going on an adventure and getting in better shape, meeting loads of new people, gaining new skills and hopefully making it through the four years with a GI Bill and some benefits at the end, seems like a much better deal than sitting on my computer everyday shooting off emails and applications for $10 - 12 an hour jobs, having no health insurance, and just feeling like a loser. I live with my boyfriend and my lack of stable income is killing our relationship with stress, seems like we'll probably break up soon. My mother died last year and no one else in my family really seems to care at all about me. If I die, I'm pretty sure only my grandfather would be hurt, but he is very old now and will probably pass away soon. I don't feel I have as much to lose as I have to gain.\n\n Should I do it or is it a bad idea?\n\nTl;dr: Graduated college a year ago, a good job with a good company has been difficult. My family is pretty estranged from me and my relationship is on the verge of breaking up anyway. Should I go join the military?",

    "text": "Staying Productive in a Job You Hate - My Experience Have you ever woken up in the morning feeling like there was no way you were going to make it through your work day? Sadly, millions of people around the world dread going to their jobs which takes a mental and physical toll on their bodies. I too was once this person. Every morning, I cringed at the sound of my alarm knowing that I would have to put in 8+ hours of work at a job I despised only to have to do it again the next day, and the day after that and the day after that. But, as an adult with bills to pay and output to produce, I had to find a way to keep up my productivity levels while at the office. My past jobs experienced have lead me to creating a step by step process for remaining productive at a job you hate which I hope can help a few of you out! Here it is:\n\nStep #1: Identify the cause of your work dissatisfaction\n\nThere are a million reasons why you may dislike your job. You may have a terrible boss, you may be overloaded by work or you may feel like you’ve plateaued in the position you currently hold. Identifying the cause of your dissatisfaction is imperative if you are going to remain productive at work. To do this, create a list of all the aspects of your job that you hate and think about whether these things can be changed or if they are mandatory for the position. Perhaps, you work in an industry where working 70 hours a week is non-negotiable or maybe there is no chance you can change bosses. Once you have your list made up, ask yourself, is putting up with these negative factors worth it? Unfortunately, this situation only gets worse when you realize that the work itself is the critical issue which brings us to Step #2.\n\nStep #2: Remember Why You Took The Job\n\nIf you can, think back to why you took your job in the first place. For students, it may have been the only job to offer you a position given your little experience or maybe the job offered a great benefits package you couldn’t turn down. While, in theory, you should be choosing a career path you find exciting and fulfilling let’s be real, that isn’t always the case. When you start to feel bogged down by your job, take a second to think about what good you do get out of your position. In my case, I had to get that first job to gain experience and obtain my professional designations. For you, it may be getting insurance to cover your children’s medical costs. While this strategy may not solve all of your problems, it should help you keep up your work output especially combined with Step #3. \n\nStep #3: Find Aspects You Like\n\nSo we’ve already established that you hate your job but even the worst jobs have some upsides to them. For me, I loved the people I worked with. As much as the environment wasn’t optimal for many reasons, socializing with my colleagues really helped me make it through the day.  For you, maybe it’s that you have a gym at work or that you have catered food served daily. Pick out the aspects that you do like and focus on those. It can be easy to place all of our attention on the parts of the job that negatively influence our mood but you probably do have great aspects that you underappreciate. \n\nStep #4: Pursue your passions outside of work\n\nOkay so your days at work typically suck, lucky for you that job you hate only takes up 1/3 of your day leaving you with 1/3 to sleep and 1/3 to do whatever else you want. Some of the most common complaints I hear from others who aren’t exactly thrilled with the job they have is that their role is boring and unimpactful. This is where your extracurricular activities come into play. Fill your time outside of work with enjoyable activities like sports or running a side business. You might even want to find a way to monetize that side passion so you have an escape route of sorts if your “real” job becomes too much. By having something meaningful in your life, you will have something to ease the pain of your 9 to 5 grind.\n\nStep #5: Quit\n\nYou’ve picked out aspects of the job you like, you’ve added fun activities into your life to distract you from the daily grind and still you can’t manage to stay productive at that job you hate. Sometimes, you have to wave the white flag and admit that you need a change of pace. We live in a time where most professionals will hold numerous roles over the course of their careers making job changes more socially acceptable than ever before. So, if you really can’t hack it at your current gig, start looking for new jobs. Scan job boards and tap into your network to see what opportunities are out there. When I was working in a job I hated, searching for a new position gave me a sense of hope and helped me cope with the environment I was in because I knew that the suffering would soon come to an end. If you are in a similar position, just know that moving into a new role may be just what you need to get re-invigorated in your career and life in general!\n\nI hope this helps those who are struggling with their current roles. Please don't despair, a better future lies ahead :)",

    "text": "OB/GYN jokes + a first year med student = one hell of a pap smear So this happened about a month ago during an appointment to qualify me for a medical study. This required general questions about my health, and a pap smear... tldr at the bottom\n\nI was leaned back on the table, about to get my pap, legs spread, in the stirrups, y'know the deal. There are 3 other people in the room: the doctor (a very small, older, sweet, Asian man), his med student (young, probably 23ish IF that old Indian girl), and the research nurse (white, late 20s, and I kind of knew her from my very small college; different major so we saw each other in passing but never in classes). The doctor was looking for a smaller speculum and was explaining to his student the difference. He holds up the larger speculum and said \"we would only use a speculum this large on a vagina this small if we dont want her to come back.\" and laughs hysterically for about 15 seconds. Awkward laughter from all parties... it was a good joke but my lady bits are starting to feel the chill of the air and I came in for a pap, not a comedy show. \n\nThen he does the pap, explaining what he was doing the whole time for his med student. He then asked me if I would mind if his student did a digital exam on me so she can get some practice. I said sure before realizing that a digital exam=when they stick their DIGITS AS IN FINGERS in ya and feel your uterus. I still didn't mind but wasn't considering the awkwardness of this when I said yes. \n\nThis poor girl was SO nervous. She managed to stammer out that this would be her first time and she asked him to walk her through it. So he performed the exam first, then she did. While she is doing the exam she's poking around, trying to feel the uterus and y'know when you're trying to listen closely to something or you're trying to grab something that fell between the couch and the wall and you kinda blankly stare in front of you? So she had that look on her face but staring into my eyes. The doctor meanwhile is asking her and I if we feel it and what she thinks the positioning of my uterus is, and some other medical jargon but she just continues staring into my soul. I didn't know if I should break the gaze or if it would make her realize that she was eye fucking me and finger blasting me at the same time, so I just kept awkwardly staring at her. \n\nAfterwards she was really grateful and thanked me a lot and apologized for taking so long. I'm pretty sure I was the first vagina she ever entered. \n\nTL;DR: had a pap where the doctor made speculum jokes and the med student finger fucked me for 7 minutes trying to find my uterus while locking eyes with me.\n\nEdit: these comments are giving me life, please keep telling me all of your awkward pap stories!!\n\nEdit edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH KIND STRANGER FOR THE SILVER!! I'm so glad you all have enjoyed my story!!",

    "text": "To the man who told me I look like sunshine A few weeks ago, I started feeling like my world was falling apart. Things in my life changed, I felt out of control, and my mental health took a nose dive. I lost 6 pounds the first 3 days, I couldn't sleep. Panic attacks happened daily, multiple times. I was far from okay.\n\nI kept myself busy as much as I could. Because when I wasn't busy, I was thinking. And being alone in my head is not a nice place to be.\n\nSo I stayed busy. Working, reading, doodling, writing, anything. I was barely getting by but I was managing.\n\nBut then I had to grab supplies from the ER, which is a decent walk away from my clinic. I dreaded the walk. Not because of how many steps or minutes it took - in the medical field, you get used to walking a ridiculous amount - but because I knew that the whole walk, I'd be by myself, alone with my thoughts, even if it was just a few moments. If you've been where I am, you know how terrifying that can be.\n\nSo after procrastinating as long as possible, I finally gathered my composure and walked. And as soon as I stepped through my clinic doors, the thoughts came racing in. They taunted me, dancing like flames in an unstoppable fire.\n\nMost people didn't make eye contact with me. This was good.\n\nUntil towards the right of a hallway sat an old man. His skin was worn and wrinkled; the little hair he had left was white and grey. His pants were high on his hips and his back hunched a bit. My gaze randomly caught his and on cue, being second nature at this point to do so when seeing a patient, I gave him the best smile I could muster.\n\nHe immediately smiled back, his eyes glistened, and without missing a beat he excitedly exclaimed, \"You look like sunshine!\"\n\nI stopped for a second. His words sent a shock to my brain and for a short moment, the bad thoughts stopped. I happily thanked him, made a little small talk, and went on my way.\n\nHe didn't know that I had been crying and praying for death just hours before. He didn't know that I crawled into bed every night, not being able to fall asleep because of the heavy sensation of my heart pounding every time my eyelids dared to close. He didnt know that I felt unsafe and scared and alone. He didn't know the demons I was fighting as I walked from one end of the hospital to another.\n\nBut his words sparked enough happiness and joy in me to remind me that I am here for a reason. Contrary to what I often tell myself, I am a good person. I can make a difference in people's lives by just existing, just as easily as they can make a difference in mine. I am worthy of being alive.\n\nI am still struggling but finally am receiving the help I desperately needed. But when things get rough, I think back to that old man, his happy smile and the words he spoke to me. His kindness reminded me that the sun will always come up again tomorrow - the one in the sky, and the one within me.",

    "text": "Would like some advice on management acute psychosis at the emergency department Hello physician of reddit. I'm a PGY-1 GP in a rural hospital in east Asia. I would like some advice regarding a situation I faced recently. I have read the rules but I am not sure if this post is appropriate so if it is not then I apologize. Please feel free to delete this post if it is so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the situation was, I was on night shift. It was around 21:00. There was a 44 years old male presenting with chief complaint of auditory hallucination of someone trying to kill him for 2 days. He looked fatigued and was oriented to time, place, person and was coherent. No past history of illness in the EMR, and the patient denied any underlying disease or medication. He had history of drinking alcohol 5-6 glasses a day everyday for 5 months, and denied any other substance use. He denied suicidal thought, depression or other mood disorder. Physical exam reveled no focal neurological deficit. I ran the basic lab, CBC, Electrolyte including calcium, phosphate and magnesium, Liver function. I also ordered a CT Scan with contrast media of the brain (There was no MRI by the way at my hospital). All tests came out negative and the CT scan revealed no gross hemorrhage, mass or structural lesion. Then I noticed that his white blood cell was 13,000, not a lot but not that normal either in my opinion. The patient denied history of fever but I deemed history unreliable due to copious amount of alcohol drinking. The relatives who came with him added that there were moments where he completely \"zoned out\" and did not speak a word but his gaze was still responsive to sound.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter my evaluation, due to the acute onset of 1st psychosis episode, with no family history and no obvious substance use, coupled with a little leukocytosis and what might be episodes of seizure or alteration of consciousness, I concluded that there were character characteristics possibly indicative of organic origin of psychosis. It was my understanding that any organic cause of psychosis must be excluded first before diagnosing functional psychosis. I gave him 2.5 mg intramuscular halopedirol. I then admitted the patient to the medical ward with plans to observe fever or sign of alteration of consciousness and to further consider lumbar puncture, and if all turn out negative then consider psychiatric consult. The intern at the medical floor proceeded to call me 1 hour later and berate me for admitting a psychiatric patient to a medical ward with no psychiatric consult first. He then refused to see the patient and told me that, since I just admitted a psychiatric patient to internal medicine, I was to be the one who see him. The next morning, I went to the internal medicine floor (Not my floor. I went in to see this patient especially) to discovered that the patient was lucid, void of fever and was hearing no auditory hallucination. I consulted the psychiatrist on call and was told over the phone to discharge the patient and told the patient to came to the psychiatric OPD with no medication as he wished to evaluate him first due to it being his first episode of psychosis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I just graduated for 5-6 months and I certainly know that am still stupid so I would like some insight on whether my management was that egregious and what I could have done differently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo elaborate on my hospital a bit, it is a relatively small hospital compared to what you would see in the west. We have attending in general medicine, general surg and orthopedics but no sub specialty. There is no emergency physician. The emergency room is manned by PGY-1 GP interns from different department. There is no urgent care, only OPD or emergency room and IPD so when the OPD is closed, every case get routed to the emergency room.",

    "text": "I had my first really sick patient and I did it. Tldr: I'm a new ICU nurse and I kept an almost-dead patient alive for 12 hours then made him much better the next 12 hours and I'm proud of myself.\n\nI'm new to a medical ICU, just since end-March I've been there and have only a couple years nursing experience total.  I worked nights all weekend, Friday was a post-extubation patient who was rude and demanding and ultimately ruined everyone's day/night by having family speak to patient advocate and lie about things that happened during his care.\n\nAnyways. Saturday evening I was not looking forward to being this guys nurse again. But I was in a different room. An intubated new admit who was just freshly lined and on 100% O2 with 84% SpO2 and family hadn't been in to see yet. He looked sick enough to code any minute on high doses of Norepi and needing Vasopressin started. Within the first 2 hours of my shift I somehow assessed him, adjusted a bunch of inotoropes, proned him, shifted his potassium, sent more bloodwork and got many many new meds running and into him while keeping everything compatible somehow. It was such a whirlwind of feeling like I had no idea what the hell I was doing but also being the only person who knew what the patient needed. I had a great charge nurse and an amazing team that helped with everything. I normally hate asking for help when I *could* technically do it myself but this time I needed everyone to do my little things so I could focus on the big things. I felt like I was barking commands at people when they'd approach me asking how they could help... but I needed stuff and I needed it now because this patient was tanking. I didn't get to sit down and chart on the patient myself until around 2330pm (4 hours after coming on). And even then I had lots of non-urgent things to do. I had jot notes all over the white board and a handful of written notes from other nurses to try and transcribe what happened when. I then somehow managed to get my shit together and bring family in, explain clearly what was happening and reminding them to keep hope but we also need to realistic that the patient is very critical. He is stable right now but with his current state and history anything could happen. I got all the family paperwork done, charting, and checking the chart by 0100. Cleaned and organized my lines and room (because it was a legit disaster), changed my dressings and started 2 new peripheral IVs, shifted his potassium *again* all by 0300 at which time the charge nurse forced me to go eat something because I'd been running since 1900. All while doing q30m vitals and train-of-fours for the paralytic we were giving him, q2h oral care, eye care, and head turns, frequent bloodwork, and calling the physician with changes trying to figure out our next steps. I went home feeling terrified about what I'd missed and worried some mistake of mine would come forward and I'd have to face the idea of accidentally killing a patient.\n\n\nLooking back it was insane that I was able to maintain my composure. I honestly almost cried a few times from being so overwhelmed and feeling like \"I can't do this why do they think I can do this?? I'm going to kill this patient\". I worked two nights with him and by the end of my next shift with him he was so much better. Requiring way less oxygen, weaned off vaso and almost off Norepi. I didn't even realize how much I was managing that first night until I took a step back and saw I had 11 pumps going in the room (including the tube feed, cisatracurium, lasix, heparin, humulin r, NS, norepi, vasopressin, propofol, fentanyl and amiodarone). \n\n\nI just needed to share somewhere that I did it and I did it okay. I didn't do it well. But I did it safely and that's all that really matters. My team was amazing and I'm just as proud of them as I am of myself. I work in a great unit. I also f**king love the ICU and I don't think I'll ever go anywhere else unless I leave bedside all together.",

The chance to feel superior over others?\n\nI'm not talking major and continued careless errors here, I'm talking about little things that have no impact toward patient care or outcomes.

Fuck the glowing patient review I got from him, right?\n\nThen you get the Nosey Nancys who run and tell management about any and all mistakes (no matter how small) the previous shift made. Didn't label your IV tubing with the date? Write up. Didn't update your white board? Write up. One nurse got written up for telling a patient (after the patient ASKED for his advice on how to improve her health) \"you should lose weight\" because another staff member heard him and thought it was mean.

I'm also a former tech of multiple years, I'm nearly done with my RN program (a few mos left), and had previously volunteered on this floor.\n\nThe other night I was having my second solo night (I work weekend nights) on this floor after having recently completed orientation. I already have a great reputation as a hard worker and knowledgeable CNA via my past orientation, but still it was only my second night solo. Ratios for me are ~ 1:20 at night. I'm the only CNA on the floor with lots of individual pt rooms, with RNs running 1:4.\n\nI had a pt with a particularly painful, terminal condition. On this second solo night of mine, pt's call-bell rings and it's a busy time so I make it there first long before the RN, who is a float RN. As I'm walking in, the pt's spouse is going in to use the pt bathroom (which they're not supposed to do). The pt tells me they're experiencing a lot of pain in their head, deltoid area, and low back. The pt was not particularly lucid and the spouse is fully in the bathroom once this conversation starts and for the entirety of the conversation. I ask the patient if they would like more cold packs or hot packs (I see both in the room). \"No that won't help.\" I ask if they want to be repositioned. \"No.\" I have other callbells going off and I'm concerned especially about the splitting head pain and I know nothing of this patient's case at this point, and I find myself completely incapable of helping this patient due to my limited scope, so I kindly tell the patient that I will go let the RN know the patient is requesting pain meds and quickly leave to let the RN know asap.\n\nOver the next couple hours the call bell continues to go off in this room, and I go above and beyond for this patient as I always do for all my patients when I'm able. Pt asks for 3 hot packs, I bring 6. Patient asks for 3 glasses of water + ice & laments that they can't drink regular soda, I ask RN if pt can tolerate sprite zero (they can) and so I bring that as well. I help reposition pt multiple times with RN and charge.\n\nAfter alllll this, pt tells me that they're very upset that I \"was short them\" hours earlier. I apologize, explain that I was not at all intending to be short or unkind, but that I was worried about pt's head pain and also found myself completely incapable of satisfying pt's needs at the time due to my limited scope + I had multiple call bells going off at the time, and so that is why I was quick to leave the room. Patient is entirely unsatisfied with this explanation. Not only that, patient's spouse has now begun to parrot this complaint as well though they weren't even in the room, and is stating how \"unacceptable my behavior was.\" I tell them I'm sorry they felt this way, again it was not my intent and I reiterate I was just trying to make sure their needs could be met as quickly as possible by the RN. Still unsatisfied. Later, float RN comes to me and asks me \"what exactly was said to them? what did you say? they're pissed.\" She's very concerned I may have done something wrong. I explain. She shrugs it off and reiterates that she sides with me, they seem unreasonable and she doesn't think I did anything wrong.\n\nNext night, I come back. I'm in there with charge and non-float RN who is taking care of pt. I'm helping re-position pt yet again. Pt is getting tearful and frustrated about the pain and situation and re-positioning etc, and then launches into a tirade about how they do not want to have me involved in their care anymore. They say how disrespectful and \"short\" I was previously. How terrible I am. Spouse parrots it. They say they want to escalate this to management. They complain that we're \"understaffed\" and its unacceptable that they can't get another CNA. I try to briefly explain the misunderstanding but they say they do not want me to talk and they won't hear any of it. They won't be convinced that I wasn't short and disrespectful to them. You honestly would've thought I shot their dog with how horrible they were making me sound. Truly all because I left the room quickly because I was concerned for the pt's safety (thought the head pain might've been a new symptom) + I couldn't do anything for the patient myself due to limited scope + I have shitty 1:20 ratios and had lots of call lights going off.\n\nLuckily, charge and RN basically side with me, as they themselves saw how generally unreasonable this family was being. Patient and spouse basically wanted at least 2 staff members in there caring for pt at nearly all times that night, and patient couldn't even state what it was that pt wanted at nearly any given moment. Still, when we left the room, they immediately asked me what the hell happened previously, since neither of them were on shift the prior night. Once I explain, they roll their eyes and tell me not to worry about it. They say they've been accused like this before. Still I am so pissed that I was even put in this situation, especially as a new employee who has an otherwise perfect reputation so far, and who is trying to line up an RN gig. Additionally, it pisses me off because I, EVEN STILL, would be the CNA who would gladly be in that room putting them on and off the commode and wiping their ass every 5 minutes or repositioning them or getting them more ice or hot packs every 5 minutes if I could because that's the kind of CNA I am. Even still, even after they made me sound like the devil himself, I would still gladly do that for them, and I did do that for them before they made up accusations against me. Ugh it just makes me livid, but also sad, as someone who has been pouring their life into pursuing nursing for 5 years now and loves working hard for all my patients. I'm fine and I don't need reassurance that I'm a good CNA, I mostly just found myself unsure of how to handle this accusation. \"The client\" is NOT always right.\n\nIt pisses me off to no end the idea that my entire working reputation and even my livelihood and license and all the work I've put in to this career could potentially be threatened by such stupid, baseless, singular accusation. As a young, tall, 200-lb, white male...What if this had been a baseless racism allegation? Or a physical assault allegation? Or worse, a sexual misconduct allegation? Would my charge have believed me then? Could I have been blacklisted in this hospital or had my future licensed threatened? Who knows? I constantly have to go into rooms solo (though I try not to do pericare solo), but it's just not realistic to say I should do otherwise with my ratios, and all it takes is one or two accusations like these to put me in jeopardy. That's bullshit. What will my manager think if this is escalated? She's probably going to hear of it regardless. Ugh it's such bullshit that I even have to deal with this, as I know I'm a CNA of the highest caliber and highest compassion for all my patients, truly.\n\nTbh baseless accusations like this are honestly my biggest fear as a big dude in nursing, and also my biggest dislike in the nursing career. Why do people have to be so shitty sometimes, and how do you all deal with this sort of thing? /rantover",

I’m a private duty LPN for a local pediatric hospital. I’ve been a nurse for years now so it’s nothing new. \n\nOnward,\n\nI’ve been coming to a home for awhile now, the child has hx of seizures and muscle rigidity. They’re given Ativan concentrate routinely, this is the primary method of seizure control. There is “known” diversion going on. It’s suspected mom dilutes (you read that right) her Ativan and leaves diluted ass medication for her disabled kid. Humanity. \n\nSeveral of us have notified our respective supervisors, we were given the BS advice to “document your findings” but not say that directly. I was asked to write a statement, in which I declined bc I’ve been burned in situations like these before. \n\nThe medication is dispensed 10-12 bottles at a time. Cyclically the child will start having a shit ton of seizures, and the medication will have a watery consistency. There are other “backup” meds to be given PRN but they’re not as effective. \n\nToday I noticed the same watery bottle, so I looked at the three remaining bottles and the tamper seal is white, indicating they’ve been opened. They also were watery, not like the usual viscous Ativan. \n\nMy questions: I’m stumped bc giving a known altered drug seems like a huge liability. The kid is a few clusters from a grand mal that would do some damage. We’ve already told management who is apathetic and loose lipped, so any reports goes to this one senior RN who’s very tight with the mom. Again I’ve been used as the scapegoat and pissed on by management when they’ve ignored diversion, and it was discovered and they had to address it (hope that makes sense) \n\nAny advice or input? I thought of contacting our in-house attorneys and asking. I’m just torn as if any of this shit hits the fan, we  all know this has been tampered with, and hello, liability. \n\nUgh.

    "text": "Dealing with Title I Culture Shock after teaching Suburban Honors Kids So my Student Teaching placement I was teaching Honors Freshman Social Studies at a Suburban High School. I feel like I didn’t get to practice that much classroom management because the students were so focused and cared a ton about their grades. Besides maybe a few off topic conversations which I redirected and they immediately corrected behavior I didn’t have to deal with anything. My first year placement is teaching 6th Grade ELA in a Title I School. So in addition to teaching a subject I never have taught before the kids behavior is black and white. Not only are the kids really disrespectful and disruptive when I ask them to do something they flat out refuse. They also don’t take responsibility for their work and blame me or others for their lack of effort. The homework turn in rate for my Honors Class was about 90% on a bad day. With my current classes it was about 50% on a good day which led me to stop assigning it. I’ve been struggling a lot this year. Not with evaluations because they are effective, but with every day coming to school and teaching and not feeling like I wanna pull my hair out. I’m a first year teacher and was wondering if anyone experienced a similar culture shock.",

    "text": "Some thoughts on teaching, vol. III I've made a couple of these threads before where I just post some thoughts and questions I have about our field. I figure it's simpler to collect them all into one place rather than make several separate topics\n\nFeel free to chip in with your own thoughts, but please keep it civil\n\n- Are public schools really that concerned with hiring the best? The impression I've gotten is that \"the best\" really means \"someone who will do as they're told and not upset the status quo\". Obviously there are exceptions, but those are exactly that: exceptions. Much like how they do with our students, admin seems like they want a culture of compliance among their staff rather than taking any sort of risk\n\n- Tied into the prior point, we need to change the way we hire in education. I've been to too many interviews where it's just \"Ask routine question, write down answer, move on\". They're not organic, they're not particularly effective, and they don't give the candidate an opportunity to really express who they are. We also need to rejig online applications - how many great candidates have missed out on a job because they didn't \"pass\" an online personality test or because they didn't include enough buzzwords in their application? Sure, schools will tell you that the teachers they have are good, but why settle for good when you could potentially do better?\n\n- As much as I love sports, and as much as I've enjoyed coaching in the past, I'm firmly of the opinion that we need to separate sports from school. Too many schools prioritize spending on their sports/teams, and it's become a farce how much pressure there is on teachers to pass along athletes. I enjoy athletics, but that's a lot of money we could be spending on our teachers and classes \n\n- We need to change our standards for people going into admin, because too many admin have become the same negative stereotype: incompetent, oblivious, and willing to throw their teachers under the bus. I think we should require admin to at least partially continue teaching. We also need to train our admin to be better managers. Good admin support their staff, encourage academic autonomy and creativity among their teachers, and take risks. This is sorely lacking in the majority of our schools\n\n- Happier staff creates better work. Why is this so difficult for public education to understand?\n\n- I learned about \"snowplow parenting\" recently, a term used for parents who want to remove as many obstacles as possible from their children's lives and protect them from being hurt, whether that's physically or emotionally. This is mostly a thing with privileged families, but let's get real, most of our schools have become a form of \"snowplow teaching\", except it's even worse: a lot of us work with underprivileged students who already face difficulties in their personal lives. Then they get to school and just get passed along and don't suffer any consequences. This isn't teachers' faults (though I've known some who do this because it's simply the easier route); it's all on admin, who are, apparently, clueless as to what effect this will all have on the students when they're thrust into the real world. Finding a job is only getting harder, yet we're passing kids along with fewer and fewer skills\n\n- Does anyone else feel our teaching population is too homogeneous? Yes, there are exceptions, but I feel like I've met too many of the same kinds of people in our schools. That isn't to say they're useless or bad teachers, it's only an observation. Diversity in people and their ideas/thoughts will only strengthen our education system\n\n- I'd never really thought about this before, but low teacher pay is rooted in misogyny, period. We've heard it plenty of times before: if teaching was dominated by white men, it'd be a completely different story. The other thing that struck me is it seems easier to con and guilt our female teachers to justify the poor pay: \"Don't you care about kids?\" and so on and so forth\n\n- Sometimes we are our own worst enemies. I'll talk to colleagues or teachers elsewhere and hear their views on things, but when they're in a meeting they'll change course just to appease admin. Or they won't say anything at all. There's also the teachers who suck up to admin to get on their good sides. This doesn't help our profession, because it gives admin the incentive to continue doing what they're doing. We need to get all (or as many as we can) teachers on the same page if we want to go about enacting real change\n\n- This one has been repeated ad nauseum, but I want to bring it up again: please, for the love of everything, stop bragging about how many hours you \"work\" in a week or how \"well\" you do your job despite having to work retail on the weekends. I went to an interview recently where two of the teachers on the panel seemed proud of the fact that they could grade papers while working their second jobs. This just gives our critics more ammo to keep us down. If you're one of these people, please stop. You're hurting everyone",

I am a veteran (3 years in the army with one tour in Iraq). Teaching is the most stressful thing in my life. I hate classroom management issues. Most people think that because I was in the army I would be good with handling kids--I am not. I cannot talk to students like I would soldiers (If I did I would make the coaches blush and then be fired). I love history and I love creating lessons but implementing them is awful.\n\n My first year in teaching was at a Title 1 \"urban\" school. I literally had to dodge bullets there from drive-by shootings. I did my time in the trenches. I was the only white person in the room for most of my classes. It was hell on earth. I would have rather been back in Iraq. Next school I was at was a low income Title 1 applicable school (68% black and on free and reduced lunch). Now I am teaching at a country school with very different demographics (mostly white, though lots of poverty still). I just cannot bring myself to enjoy what I do. I hate every minute of it. I do not think a change of school would change anything. \n\nI try my best but kids are little shits and I just have to find something else to do. What are my options?

    "text": "First year teacher, what do I do in this situation? Sorry for the rant. I'm a young white female HS science teacher (gay but not out to students). I'm originally from a very white conservative town.  I teach in a very diverse NYC school.  It's my first year and the admin is super supportive, co-workers are super helpful and great mentors,  and I really enjoy teaching. \n\nI wanted to teach in a diverse area in a Title 1 school because I felt like I could probably relate to the students more than I could relate to students where I'm from. \n\nDespite growing up in white middle class suburbia,  my parents struggled to pay bills and regularly accepted food donations to keep us fed.  I survived a violent crime at a young age and have dealt with clinical depression and PTSD for the majority of my life.  I've had to be financially independent since i graduated high school. My parents do not accept me for being gay. My dad is verbally and emotionally abusive but stopped talking to me for the past couple of years because of our differing views.\n\nObviously being white I can't relate to the students' experiences with systemic racism,  and I don't pretend to understand what racism feels like. And I don't know what my students who are immigrants have gone through or are going through either. But I can at least relate to surface level discrimination (as a woman in science and as a lesbian in general).  \n\n\n\nWell as a first year teacher,  I didn't start off with strong classroom management and I try to be very understanding and kind to the students.  So naturally they walked all over me, took complete advantage of me,  and as soon as I tried to apply what I've learned and get classroom management under control,  they lashed out. \n\nOne particularly tough student calls me a racist for asking the class generally to behave, acting like I'm addressing only him by name. During a test this week he stormed out of the room and declared in the hallway that I'm racist because I asked EVERYONE to stop talking during the test.  He is the oldest kid in the school and the younger students look up to him,  so they have started to tell me that they feel targeted as well if I tell them that I need them to be quiet during a test.\n\n\nAnd these kids try to gaslight me (challenge my reality to drive me crazy) every day.  I ask them not to talk while I'm talking,  they say they weren't talking. I say I saw you talking and I need you to stop talking. They say no, I wasn't talking. I tell them their classmates deserve a quite testing space and ask them to be mindful of their peers,  and they tell me they don't need a quiet space. They have no regard for other people. \n\n\nI thought I could relate to these kids,  but I just can't understand them.  I had a tough life growing up,  I thought at least some of them would have had similarly tough lives  and would have some level of maturity.  But it's like I'm teaching the third grade most days. I watch them throw a water bottle and reprimand them and they tell me they didn't throw it!\n\nI always felt ostracized growing up having such a different perspective than my peers and family,  and I feel totally ostracized by my students now. They don't accept me and since they keep playing the race card it feels like they just don't like me because I'm white and they see me as not like them. \n\nThey operate on the principle that everyone,  including teachers,  have to earn their respect. I try to show interest in their interests,  I check in on them when they seem to be having a bad day,  I'm there for them every day,  and I try very hard  to be as fair as possible in everything. But I have been unable to earn their respect. What can I do?\n\nThank goodness I have the next week off for mid writer recess because I've been so distraught over this lately. \n\n\n\nTL;DR  I assumed since low income students in a rough area experience more difficulties  in life they'd be more mature and I could relate to them.  I was terribly wrong. I can't seem to earn my students respect and I can't understand their logic behind anything.",

    "text": "When Students Think You're a Joke There's been something I've wondered about since my days substitute teaching, that was confirmed today. In the past, I thought a lot of my issues were due to being a sub. Kids completely ignoring me, thinking me redirecting them or actually handing out discipline is a funny joke, or bragging about it later that they got in trouble with me, were all issues I seemed to have a substitute that I dismissed as being a substitute. However, the problem's seem to continue into my first year teaching (I teach 9th grade)\n\n1. In one class, I had a student who literally did no work the entire time I had him. He'd come to my class, ignore me and distract his friends. We can issue \"mandatory tutorials\" and I did so, called his parents (who were like, this is unacceptable, we'll fix this right away). Nothing changed, and during the first test we had, he literally sat there. At this point, administration removed him from my class and apparently he's doing well in another teacher's.\n2. Two others, down from five, I've struggled so much with they've already gotten multiple ISS's from their misbehavior in my class alone. When I think about it, they've never not been in ISS when I haven't assisted. They're literally at a point now where every referral from me is one cause it's escalated that much. Talking to them one on one has done nothing. Parent conferences have done nothing. Nothing's worked. They're in two different classes, and at least get their work done.\n3. The Hellspawn - I have four other students in my fifth period who are the sole reason that class has assigned seats because they're four friends I had to separate or they'd talk and goof around the whole period. It's almost like they have this mentality of \"we're here and miserable so we want to make sure everyone else is miserable as well.\" They don't constantly talk over me, one of them actually tries to talk over me *like I interrupted him*. With them, it's like I'm not in the room, they literally do whatever they want and don't give a shit about the repercussions. None of them are allowed to leave class cause none of them come back if they do, two have decided to walk out on multiple occasions.\n\nHere's an example, on Friday, they literally ran into class pretending to shoot each other with their phones, and I was like \"yeah, try that again cause that's how you get sent to an alternative school.\" They laughed, walked out, and returned to standing literally in between the class and I and talking over me, completely ignoring me. Even students were annoyed at them. They sit down with a lineman in the class yelled at them \"can y'all fucking move and listen to her.\" Later in the period, one of the boys went to the other one, ignoring me to tell him to go back to his seat and then literally started fighting his friends, and it wasn't play. Admin has literally observed this class and really doesn't have any advice other than \"keep documenting and sending them in.\" The gun incident and fight was like the tenth and eleventh office referral I've sent that group and it's been six weeks of school.\n\nWhatever, that's ultimately the job, you gotta deal with classroom management struggles, behavior problems, everything. You learn you grow, and you deal. Well, my education didn't really prepare me how to handle a situation not based from like attention, boredom, stress, or maybe even just them being a shitty kid one of the many \"school-approved\" reasons for behavior issues.\n\nI was walking down the hall this morning from the English wing to mine cause I had to drop off something I borrowed from a friend of mine. Anyway, I'm nearing a corner and overhear this conversation from those boys about Friday.\n\n>Hellspawn A: Yeah, that was pretty fucking funny with the phone guns on Friday. Miss Snowymacie got so mad.  \n>  \n>Other kid, mentioned in 2: Shit, y'all have so much fun in her class.

    "text": "Love these kids This might end up on r/thathappened, but I’ll swear until the end this is truth. \n\nI suffer with gout. For those who don’t know, it’s considered one of the most painful conditions to live with. I’m in constant low level pain at best, and during this week, an attack left me in constant agony. I could feel every individual stitch on my shoe in the affected area, and I needed a walking stick to even be able to move around. \n\nI work preschool. Kids from 3-5. It’s Friday night of a week from hell. Everyone is watching the clock waiting for the parents to finally arrive. Me and a couple of students pick a “Where’s Wally” book to read (we’re British). After a few pages, the kids are super invested, making it a race to see who can find the red and white prick first. Suddenly, one kid (called D from now on) finds it. She jumps for joy... and double foot stomps right on top of my foot. \n\nThe roar I let out is heard throughout the building, and instinct makes me roughly grab Ds arm and yank her to the side. She runs, petrified to another teacher and I know. I’m screwed. I’m still well into my probation period after being hired, and I’ve technically just assaulted a child. D is now terrified and crying, and I’m doubled over in agony. \n\nThe other teacher goes to comfort D and I apologise to the other child (E) for shouting. They knew about my foot and I explain how D landed on it by accident. I’m doing my best to hold back tears, both from pain and the expectation that I might be fired. E looks at me with a tiny angry pout (such that only a 3 year old can pull off) and states “I’m gonna look after you and protect you!” Then gives me the biggest hug her tiny arms can manage. I’m not ashamed to say I nearly broke down. E didn’t leave my side for an hour. Even after we finished the book. I asked if she wanted to get another but she shook her head and didn’t let go of me. \n\nEventually mum arrived and E very slowly let go and ran to her. I got up and hobbled my way over to her and explained what happened and how all the candy in the house wouldn’t be enough for what E did for me. \n\nI’ve learnt that it’s her birthday tomorrow. Maybe I should get her something.",

    "text": "I need my “normal meter” checked I’m a history teacher who is currently subbing because of life’s twists and turns - I’ve been in the classroom for 8 years. I think maybe my brain isn’t working correctly because I’m questioning my own ability after the shitshow that was this week. \n\n\n\nI’ll create a bullet pointed synopsis of events to avoid big ass blocks of text:\n\n\n\n- At my site that I currently sub about 4/5 days of the week at, there are about 200 students. \n\n\n\n\n- It is an alternative high school for students who aren’t successful in the mainstream, high population, low one on one contact schools that are in the district. \n\n\n\n\n- I love 99.99% of these students, I genuinely have fun at work and have excellent rapport with the majority of them. Students who are aloof to me or don’t care still get treated with identical respect and dignity. \n\n\n\n\n- Three weeks ago there was a student who needed to derail any sentence that I started to say. I knew him well, and was caught off guard with his words and actions. He stormed out because he was disappointed that I didn’t fight with him verbally in front of the class and told the VP I was “talking shit” to all the students. The VP came in and removed ME from the room, she had another regular classroom teacher cover the rest of the day. \n\n\n\n\n\n- The VP admonished me for “doing elementary school level classroom management” (specifically, I wanted to be able to say a sentence without being interrupted. This was wrong...?)\n\n\n\n\n\n- The VP specifically said “if a student is creating an issue, just start writing referrals. I was a sub once too and I was too prideful to write referrals because I didn’t want anyone to think that I wasn’t in control.” So, this was wrong, I deal with behavior by writing referrals when that is the school procedure. I do not have pride in how well I can conceal problems from admin. This irked me and I wasn’t permitted to go back into the classroom to get my things until after school. \n\n\n\n\n\n- Yesterday, I wrote 5 referrals for infractions that ranged from continuously squirting water across the room, to ignoring me and refusing to come back into the classroom, to a student saying they needed the restroom and that student vanished from campus. \n\n\n\n\n\n- Yesterday the VP called me into her office after school and I questioned what the school policy was for students who just walk away. I had been notifying the office that the student was no longer under my supervision and was effectively missing, that was not the right thing to do, I was told. The VP told me “take attendance and make sure no one dies” so if kids walked out, told me to fuck myself, played with their phone all period, my action was to “make a note of the behavior for the teacher to see when they return”.  I said, “What I have been doing is giving small stickers at the end of class to people who could show me progress in their work during the time they had, and making designated “phone checks” every 20 minutes. What this means is that the students have their phones on the desks, listening to music or whatever, but not scrolling instagram/face timing/tic toking. Every 20 minutes (this is during work time, not active instruction) I let them know that the next two minutes or so are an appropriate time to respond to messages/do what they need to do. After I see most of the phones put back down, I start my personal timer again - it’s not like a loud visible kitchen timer. This way, they get 20 minute chunks of focus AND they don’t have the drive of “I need to sneak a snap right now” because they have opportunities for it.”\n\n\n\n\n\n- The VP mocked me and pretended that she was me with a high pitched voice and pantomiming “Everyone! You can only use your phone when I say! I’m starting my little timer! You better listen to me because I have a timer!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was speechless at this. Past students brainstormed with me to make that phone system and it has worked really well. I had 0 pushback from students. She also said that my practice of checking their progress on their assignments and handing out stickers was “ridiculous” and asked me “Don’t the kids make fun of you?” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer is no, even though they’re between the ages of 14-20, they still fucking love a good scratch and sniff sticker. Some students show me their laptops where they’ve put all the stickers they’re gotten from me - it sounds silly but it works. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Today I returned to be a different teacher. I had the same student that completely blew me off and ignored me again. I did not bring up the previous day, I was kind and professional. I turned to the side to speak to another student, while also seeing the student from yesterday pick up a white board marker and write something where I had written my name. I said please don’t write on the board and she put the marker down. That’s when I saw that my name had been altered to say something demeaning (erasing parts of a letter and adding a few crossed L’s make it into a vulgar word). I walked over and erased it, keeping in mind that I was instructed to just tell the classroom teacher - leave the office out of it. That student continued to make poor choices during class, which I made a note to myself to document later. \n\n\n\n\n\n- A few hours later, she comes into the room at lunch with some of her friends and they start screaming at me about how *dare* I wrote a referral for “defiance” because of her behavior yesterday. I couldn’t get a word in, there were other innocent bystanders in the room and I needed it to calm the hell down. I said that we could continue this conversation with the VP, without the audience. Then she said how dare you accuse me of writing that on the board. I was confused because I hadn’t said anything to her about it. She started getting in my face and barking orders when I literally just walked out and was headed to the VP. Her friends gave her “the evidence from yesterday” and she shoved past me so she could get to the VP first. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n- After the VP spoke with the student, I told her what had happened. \n\n\n\n\n\n - I was informed that I NEVER had the authority to write a referral and it’s not my place to discipline the students. This is the opposite of her instructions from 3 weeks ago, and if subs are forbidden from writing referrals *why are there copies of blank referrals in every single substitute folder??????*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- I was interrogated about what exact words I planned on using in writing the sub report about the name changing from earlier. I said “I saw the student writing on the board where my name was and it was changed, I’m putting 2 + 2 together and coming to a conclusion.” Then I was asked if I literally saw the marker make the adjustments in real time or if I was “just speculating”. Then she asked if other students were near her at the time, and yes, students were getting seated and getting their supplies out. She’s the only one who was standing, writing on the board. I was told that I was choosing the wrong hill to die on . . . I hadn’t even written the report yet!!! I was also handed the line “this student never has problems with any teachers” so it would be me as the person to blame. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n- The student also handed the VP a pass I had written her the previous day, giving her permission to collect herself outside because she was having a panic attack, but declined the nurse or the counselor. This was supposed to cancel out the referral for ignoring me for the rest of the day and staying outside when we were moving rooms and I needed her on the same end of campus. This was part of a larger complaint that I “have a record of being unfair to *certain* students” which was new to me.  I have only ever taught at diverse schools, which I am known for, so that was a non starter for me. It was decided that I had overstepped my job description, basically. The VP said she would speak to me later and then never did. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat turned into a novel, sorry! I’ve been feeling awful since then, like a kid in trouble. I’m also dazed because the goal posts seem to move every day and I don’t find out until I’ve made a mistake. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the VP on the more logical/correct side of this? Am I just way off base and being a poor substitute? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: VP contradicts herself about discipline procedures, students are allowed to do what they want and I was wrong to tell any student otherwise. Is this the norm now and I am behind the times?",

    "text": "Learned my employee makes more than me. Should I say anything? I have worked for a solid company for many years, have done good work, been among the top performers, and earned the respect of peers and management. So far I had essentially been an individual contributor, but was recently promoted to a management role, taking on a small team of 5 and substantially more responsibility than before. Expectations of me and my team are high, and I know I wouldn't have been hired if the management didn't think I could be there.\n\nAs far as salary, I won't give exact numbers. I can definitely say I've always considered my company to compensate employees well, and certainly above average compared even to industry peers. I've always been paid well, I thought. I've honestly wondered not if, but to what extent, white male privilege has affected me. (I am queer, but white cis.) Can't really say I'd ever had a complaint about or felt undervalued by my compensation. Despite all this, by the way, I am still a millennial with intense student loans, so my higher-than-normal salary helps my family live at a fairly average level.\n\nWhen I was promoted my salary increase was 15%, and that was the first time I questioned whether my compensation was actually fair or not. Without any real basis, I expected the offer to be higher than it was, but I kind of shrugged it off, grateful what the experience from the position could do for me overall. Although I will say I didn't feel like there was really an opportunity to negotiate the topic of salary, it was very binary, do you accept this offer yes or no?\n\nThe team I've taken on is a group of individuals with various skills and experience. Before managing them I worked closely with a number of them, and especially one in particular who is the clear high performer. She's been at the company for a couple years less than me. I'd say (but with confidence my peers would agree) that this high performer and I have always operated at similar levels. We have different methods, but in terms of performance, we were in sync. We both enact change, effect results, and move things forward.\n\nSo now as a new manager I find myself having to communicate to my team about bonus payouts and such, the first time I've ever dealt with that. And in reviewing the documents coming from HR, I discovered that the high performer gets paid a lot more than me, 30% more than I was paid before the promotion. She deserves every dime she makes—probably more—but knowing how similarly we performed in the past, and now managing her, I feel like I might have been gipped or undervalued. \n\nA the very least I feel like my salary should be about equal to hers. But I also think that just being her manager, I should get paid more. And it's not about getting paid more than her, but rather about getting paid more than the highest earner on the team. Especially when she and I are both roughly equally strong employees, but now I am accountable for more as a manager with more consequential authority. I can't say exactly why I had that expectation, just thought it was kind of how management worked.\n\nSo I'm not sure what to do now. I'm conflicted because I thought I was getting paid pretty well (I actually was), but now I've learned that the company essentially pays others with a similar profile to mine at a different/better rate. And so I feel like I deserve to be at least there, at that rate, but probably higher. Then I am plagued by white male guilt and questions about morality. Am I wrong or ungrateful to feel this way just after I got a 15% salary increase? Who would I talk to about this, my manager or HR? What is even the best way to broach the topic?",

    "text": "Tired of current workplace, sorta, not entirely sure what I want to do regarding it or the future? [Canada] Hey.\n\nOkay, so, I've been working on and off at the call center for the last 6 years now ever since I graduated from High School at the age of 18. \n\nI legitimately enjoy dealing with my systems at work and I love my co-workers and management. Everyone is awesome, kind and just it is a generally awesome experience over all. At work I mostly take phone calls and act as a front line agent, but sometimes they have me up helping the floor and other agents with stuff, and occasionally they even have me training the newbies in different piolet programs. I love doing that later type of work that involves helping others and training them in tools. \n\nWhat I don't really enjoy, and what has been certainly having a negative impact on my own mental health, especially these last couple months, is the main part of the job. Being front line, dealing with customers and having to put up with horrible policies and changes put in place by people above managments head. On both sides it is nothing but greed, from the customers and from the much higher ups. Nothing illegal of course, but everything is done, from both sides of things, on a 'what will save me the most money' basis. The customers demanding more for less and getting angry when you are not, and the higher ups wanting us to get them to pay more. Among a few other things such as certain metrics that are unobtainable unless you are actively lying to the customers or just get really lucky. (Such as with transfer rate. We end up needing to direct most calls to other departments, but because the center gets dinged money and agents are getting fired for doing more then 25% transfers we are told to tell them the transfer tool isn't working and to use the direct call back number we give them for the department they need. Honestly having the number is better for the client long term, but I still feel horrible having to give a white lie about the situation.)\n\nHonestly at the end of the day I am not really sure of my options. I love my job and I relish in those moments when I can get up and help my co-workers or do training, but because I am one of the more recent people picked for this the other more tenured agents get picked to do these tasks instead. Which is fine, it makes sense since they were doing these tasks before I was that they would be the first ones picked. That is only fair. \n\nBut the more I stay on the phones and have to deal with clients the more and more my own internal walls are breaking down and sooner rather then later I am going to reach my breaking point and just lay into a customer one of these days for being an entitled person who thinks the world revolves around them, and that is not going to be pretty. it also tends to be frowned upon heavily. Agents who do end up speaking their mind completely freely to the customer tend to either get moved to another contract if it happens often (Which most other contracts are horrible person wise.), or they just end up being fired. \n\n\nAnd like, other job options really don't exist in my area. The options available are like 4 different call centers, all progressively worse then the other. A bunch of part time jobs which would never be enough to pay for my bills and make a living off of. Or a few jobs which require either years of work in that field, or a degree of some sort. Which degrees take time and money, time I kinda have, money I do not as I would never be able to go 3+ years without working full time. I would simply end up in too much debt and lose the place I am currently living at most likely.\n\nIdeally long term I would love to go into a job that involves languages, but for that I need to spend a few years learning a language or two aside from English. So although that works as a great long term plan, it doesn't fix the short term problem that seems to be getting worse by the day.\n\n\nAnd really, I just don't know what to do. \n\n\nTL;DR: Unsure of what to do given my current situation as all jobs in the area which give full time would have the same problems as my current job, and part time jobs are not enough to live off of by myself. I have an idea of where I want to be long term, but have no idea what to do to deal with the short term that if it keeps getting worse one day I will speak my mind openly to an entitled customer or someone higher up who makes the damn policies. Any and all assistance would be nice.",

People who have been there for a while have been leaving to the point that I became the only developer in my domain in my department. \n\nThis led to no code reviews, stagnation, etc. I expressed my concerns and I felt like they weren’t addressed. Currently we are on a project that was sold to a customer as a white-label solution. Well that white-label solution didn’t even exist. We had to build it but it was sold as existing. I wasn’t even part of the estimation process for this because I was working on other stuff. \n\nThat meant that we had an extremely unrealistic deadline. Basically 3 months to build software driven by a backend. About a month ago, I told them that we need more time. My manager said we couldn’t have more time because we committed to the customer. My manager also said if I have to work 100-120 hours per week to finish then that’s what needs to be done. \n\nMyself and another dev worked from 10 am to 2am a lot and the other dev would sometimes even work until 6:30am. 18 hours in one day!

I told my boss that we aren’t going to hit the deadline and he said again that we promised the customer. \n\nSo I put my 2 weeks notice in and said I’m sorry but I have been working so many hours just for the higher ups to not even appreciate it and I’m not going to do this job anymore effective 2 weeks from now because it’s taking a toll on my mental health (not to mention my long term relationship, found myself drinking every night, etc which I didn’t mention). \n\nThe good thing though is that I’m in the hiring pipeline with 8 different companies right now so I should have a job lined up soon.  I’ve only applied to about 12 companies total so 8/12 is pretty good!",

    "text": "I was forced to do my job alone even though I repeatedly told my employer that I'm not capable of doing so. Can I still improve or should I leave for other company? Hi there. I am a junior developer (4 years experience) and joined my current company in 2015. The first project I was assigned to is a GIS web application for a telecommunication company. It was a 3 man team (and later reduced to 2). I was tasked to write back-end code (using Java) and later the front-end code as well (Javascript, Jquery, CSS, HTML). It started out good since my team lead is very helpful and knowledgeable. I feel like I learned a lot when I'm doing this project especially in writing better code in term of reusability and adhering to industry convention. I didn't get to learn about software design aspect tho since I joined the project pretty late and the overall architecture was already designed and finalized. My task is basically to create new modules here and there and fix bugs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few months later, my team lead left for another project and I was alone supporting this project. I was then tasked to create similar web-app but for another domain. For me, it's not that hard since I can just reuse most of the code and only need to change a little bit here and there. However, without the team lead guiding me, I noticed that there's a dip of quality in coding (I only noticed this during SIT period). I told my project manager that I'm not confident about my coding capability and request another senior developer to guide me (mind you, I have less than 1 year in experience at this time) but my project manager said that he trusts me and refuse to provide me the senior developer. He keeps convincing me that I'm a genius and I can handle everything by myself simply because I scored quite high in an internal hackathon event (think of it like getting gold in Hackerrank). I told him getting a good result in hackathon doesn't mean shit but he still wants me to think I'm the next Linus Torvalds. Since he's a nice guy, I decided not to argue with him and decided to continue the project alone. My project pass SIT and UAT and managed to go to production.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to mid-2016, I was assigned to a new team which is an IoT-specialized team. I was assigned to be a developer and was asked to use Python. I said it's fine by me as long as I have someone to guide me. My first project is programming a Linux-based robot to be a \"smart concierge\" using Python and IBM Bluemix stack. When I first started the project, I thought I'm part of multiple Python developers since there are so many people in our first scrum meeting introducing themselves as developers. Turns out, I am THE ONLY Python developers. The other developers are handling other tech stacks. As soon as I realized that, I immediately told my project manager that I'm not confident on my coding skill to do this alone especially since I have no experience in Python. She said *\"it's fine* /u/sugarlesstea*. I believed in you. I heard from Mr <my previous project manage> that you are a genius\"*. I said \"*No don't do that to me, please. I can guarantee you that the project will be a shitshow if I have no one guiding me.*\" For some context, my part is the most important since it's the main program and the other devs are only doing API that will be used by my Python program. After several discussion with the upper management, they decided that I don't need any guidance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I expected, the project is a shitshow. Well, not a complete shitshow. The program works as expected. The robot serves its purpose (a smart concierge) but it felt very \"cheap\". I don't know how to explain this, but it felt like it's very \"amateurish\". It lacks proper error handling. It's not scalable. It felt sluggish. The code is messed up. There's no version control. No documentation. I told my project manager about this, but she said *\"no* /u/sugarlesstea*. You did an amazing job! Our customer is praising us\"*. I thought to myself, \"*Holyshit are these people dumb?*\". The program passed it's SIT and UAT. However, when the customer brings the robot to the production environment, a lot of issues emerged. I asked my project manager to have someone review my code. I am very sure that the main problem is shitty design but I don't have enough experience to tell which part is shitty (it looks fine to me but I can feel something is wrong). My project manager then agreed to have my code review...by my QA and reporting manager. They're both had been great bros to me but they have literally 0 real-world coding experience. I love them with all my heart but holy shit that code review session is fucking awkward. They clearly have no idea what they talking and all they can suggest is to remove white space here and there and then move this variable declaration from line xxx to line yyy. Literally 0 impacts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to early 2018, after countless bug fixing and code restructuring, I think I managed to make the program stable. The program no longer crashes after few hours of usage (yeah it's a lame achievement) and it felt more \"fluid\". But the code still suffers from bad design. The program looks ok from the outside but when you look into the code, it is a complete spaghetti. Well at least the customer is ok with it (I think so).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to mid-2018, I was assigned to a new project. This time, it's a facial recognition project. Again, I was tasked to be the Python developer. Again, the first thing I do is begging my project manager to have someone guiding me. Again, I was thrown to do this project alone with the same \"I believed in you\" bullshit. This time, the customer is more aggressive with us. They really wanted this project to be successful. But as you can guess, it's another shitshow...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah. After 4 years in this company, I feel like I'm losing hope. I feel like I didn't improve that much since I graduated 4 years ago. Is it expected for me to learn all this stuff by myself? Am I too entitled? Is this a normal practice in another company?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading. For the record, I'm working in a very big India-based software service company with more than 10,000 employees all over the world. The people working here are mostly very nice. The working environment is amazing and flexibility is awesome. I honestly don't hate this company and doesn't regret working here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: I was forced to do my job alone even though I repeatedly told my employer that I'm not capable of doing so. Can I still improve or should I leave for another company? Is it expected for me to learn all this stuff by myself? Am I too entitled? Is this a normal practice in another company?",

    "text": "Job search rant - very frustrated dealing with recruiters **tldr**: laid off after 5 months. Trying to find a related position asap but no luck so far. Resume getting callbacks but end of dealing with recruiters/hiring managers/phone interviews that waste my time. This is more of a rant tbh but any feedback/advice/similar situations/recruiter stories is greatly appreciated. \n\nSome background info about me: 24 years old, living in Canada, no CS Degree, been working IT/Software/Developer positions for non software companies from 20-23 years old. \n\nI was working as a systems analyst at a non software company starting August 2018 and got laid off after 5 months (3 weeks ago). Thinking back there were some obvious signs that I missed, such as my manager resigning without notice, no clear direction, cancelled meetings, no updates to emails etc that should have prompted me to start applying sooner.\n\nI have been applying to jobs, mostly on indeed and company sites, literally non stop for the past 3 weeks.  I have applied to about 500 positions (shotgun approach) that I am interested in during this time period.\n\nFrom these 500 applications, I have had 15+ phone interviews, 4 onsite interviews , and a couple of take home assignments. I thought I did well on 2 of the onsites (QA analyst position, another software developer position) but got rejected from both. \n\nBefore I was working as a systems analyst I had a 8 month gap due to personal reasons/job searching. I am getting increasingly frustrating with each day that passes. I literally just had 3 phone interviews this morning but each one was a complete waste of time.\n\n* phone interview #1) guy called me and had literally no idea what position I applied for and ended the call 5 minutes in even though the call was scheduled for 30\n* phone interview #2) recruiter talked about the company for 20+ minutes about the company asked a bunch of bs non technical questions - greatest strength/weaknesses etc. When i asked when I would hear back from them, she responded \"we'll let you know\" aka \"never\"\n* phone interview #3) recruiter called me with no prior scheduling. I let her know I would call her back in 5 minutes so I could go to a quiet place to continue our call, and when I called back it went straight to voice mail..\n\nThis seems to be the general outcome of all the phone interviews I have had. Of all the phone interviews I have had, only 2 resulted in those on sites(which I got rejected from). The other 2 onsites I made it to did not have a phone interview first(red flag) and ended up being much different than what the job posting was.\n\nWith my resume/experience/education I am getting an okay response rate, however all but 2 of these have been a complete waste of time (the 2 onsites I made it to were just the type of position I was searching for but unfortunately did not receive an offer)\n\nI have a phone interview/white board interview scheduled for tomorrow for a major software company in my location. However the requirements for the posting seem to be out of my league  - alot of technologies and skills I have no experience in..\n\nI am posting this to cscareerquestions for advice. I am trying to find a position that at least pays as much as my previous (55k) in any CS field with long term stability. The position has to be local as I can not move. I am getting a pretty good response rate I think based on the call backs, but have only had 2 promising onsites so far. I know that dealing with recruiters/hiring managers is part of the game, but how do I avoid all these phone calls/interviews that end up being a waste of my time?  I know it has only been 3 weeks, I applied for employment insurance and have benefits from my previous job for the next 90 days. However due to my previous gap in employment I am getting more nervous each day that I am not working in this field.\n\nFrom all the postings I have applied to, there are a few that I think I would be perfect for. How do I get call backs from these places so I can actually see if I am a good fit? Or at least avoid the terrible recruiters/hiring managers? \n\n**tldr**: laid off after 5 months. Trying to find a related position asap but no luck so far. Resume getting callbacks but end of dealing with recruiters/hiring managers/phone interviews that waste my time. This is more of a rant tbh but any feedback/advice/similar situations/recruiter stories is greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "[Rant] I have encountered more bullshit in my 2 years as a software developer than in my 6 years working simpler jobs Most of the bullshit I experienced happens in the workplace. The interviews for the places I got offers at were actually pretty straightforward. But these places were pretty good at hiding the skeletons in the closet when I interviewed.\n\nI have worked as a cashier, grocery stockperson, taking calls for bill collectors, and as computer lab assistant. None of the worst at these workplaces compares to the insanity I see in my software engineering jobs. Putting out fires, passive-aggressive bosses, disorganized groups, tax evasions, etc. I experience more of that in 2 years of software dev than in my 6 years in other jobs. I'm on my second SWE job. First job stayed for 6 months and this current job about a year and a half now.\n\n**First job**\n\nI was in my final semester of college. I was in a non-CS major and didn't take internships. However I took elective courses in CS and took some of my free time to build some projects and was able to convince the first company I worked for as a SWE to hire me from what I learned in those projects.\n\n This company had recently been acquired by a larger company so they had some growing pains. However, what they didn't tell me was that their current developer was quitting so I was left holding the bag. And wow, what a bag it was. Shitty legacy code mostly built by Indian developers being paid $3000 over a few months work. \n\nTheir whole deal was to manage and post content on a blog for their main magazine publication. But the custom CMS as a piece of crap. They'd be better off starting over from scratch with WordPress. But as the only developer, no time for that. Everything is go-go-go we need this fixed tomorrow or they might fire an editor because his article doesn't look good or some BS like that. Staying up till 7:30 pm was not uncommon there. My supervisor and I would be the only ones left in the building.\n\nAlso, the dev environment. The dev who left must be a saint to deal with it because we were using a CRT monitor on a desk so small that the monitor must be tilted and keyboard placed to one side of the monitor. And there is no local testing. Everything needs to be uploaded to the live server to observe the changes. Again, no time to set up things right because of deadlines.\n\n**Second job**\n\nThe second job was not as hectic as the first but still filled with a degree of shadine that every time I look at the co-founder (which was almost every day) I always catch the slimy image from him. This job is in a much better building with better offices. We walked through some large rooms with cubicles as we walked to the meeting room for an interview. It went well and later I got the offer.\n\nFirst day of work, I asked which cubicle I would work at. He told us, we all work from the meeting room. Weird but okay. Later on I learned that everything wasn't as it seems. He told a bunch of half truths at the interview. He didn't mention that the cubicles are not the same company I work in. He didn't mention his company is actually a \"garage startup\" inside a more established company (the one that owns all the floor space). Replace garage with meeting room that his boss used him to allow for side work. He didn't mention that the senior developer I talked on the speakerphone during the interview is never present in the offices, because *he lives in China*. And it just got worse from there.\n\nHe strings along developers thinking they'll go full-time after the \"contract-to-hire\" contract is finished, but in reality this company wants to hire temps. And write them off as 1099 contractors. They pass the buck of health insurance and payroll taxes onto us. But they set your hours and you use their equipment and facilities to complete the task, you shouldn't be a 1099 contractor. A \"independent contractor\" does not come into the same office day after day for 8 hours.\n\nIf this is what the company is doing, trying to bait desperate workers, I can almost guarantee they are going to be doing other shady shit, and never give you a real job. \n\n*So not only can't they be bothered to hire you in an ethical way, they can't even be bothered to hire you in an unethical but legal way.* About a year in, we all (the devs and designers) caught on eventually and started planning our escape from this job. Turnover rate went up. We had people come and go after three months, and some are still here, but most are planning to leave, including myself.\n\nContrast that to all the non-software jobs I held in the years before. No funny business, no being two-faced at interviews, and none of this white collar fraud business with tax evasion. God I wonder how you put up with this crap, must be why they pay you guys the big bucks. I've started to look for other jobs already and ready to jump out of this stinkhole.",

    "text": "Company slashing benefits immediately, need advice on giving notice Hello all,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for any advice you can give to this stranger, it is greatly appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday I got a notice from HR that starting tomorrow, all non-management employees will be payed an hourly wage, and must work exactly eight hours a day. In my opinion this is a horrible decision that will hurt the ebb and flow nature of a full-time engineering position. I work forty-five to fifty hours most weeks, and happily, because I enjoy the nature of my work. But sometimes I want to work thirty-five, or ten one day and six the next, and not have it be a big deal. Definitely average about 45-50 a week though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've already been interviewing with other companies before this because honestly, my coworkers are a nightmare. They are significantly less experienced than I am and they don't have computer science degrees, nor have they learned the fundamentals of that major, and while I don't fault them for the former, they've had plenty of opportunity to learn the latter on the job. So naturally, I am paid more than them and have a higher ranking title. They constantly chide me telling me the only reason I have this job and position is because I'm a white male and so is my boss. I am aware this is harassment and is likely a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1965. Sadly I cannot prove these allegations and for that reason have held off on reporting them, and instead have decided to move on. I'm confident karma will take care of such bitter, petty people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess what really pissed me off was in the email I received notifying me of this change taking effect tomorrow, at 4:59 pm today (literally), is that the HR person said in the email that the management will be keeping their full-time salary position (and fat performance bonuses, I'm sure), and that just us lowly peons that actually produce what keeps the company in business won't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow to me, such an immediate change in benefits is something a manager should communicate to his employees face to face. I perceive this move (notifying us of immediate changes to our employment status through HR via an email) as an act of childish cowardice on their part. I do understand I have an emotional stake in this, and would like the opinion of engineers who have experienced this sort of behavior from management.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is this: am I ethically obligated to give two weeks notice, or can I quit without it, and be acting in an ethical manner? I don't view the actions of my employer as ethical as I have from the beginning helped build this company and busted my ass without a bonus many weeks working 60+ hours, and we are now receiving more work and money than ever - keeping us full-time salaried and giving performance bonuses would not put a dent in our profits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I a fool to give two weeks? Or do I have an ethical obligation to give notice? I'm certainly leaning towards giving notice right now, as I don't wish to conduct myself by the very behavior I despise. Looking forward to hearing your opinions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy computing,\n\n\\-OP\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. My giving notice is of course contingent on receiving a job offer, which I believe I will receive shortly (so excited)! It is also perhaps worth noting I had a tough childhood with little support from family or friends (boo-hoo, poor me! ;) and have very thick skin as a result, but honestly I was so depressed as a kid I never thought I'd make it out of college alive (seriously). Despite this, and while living with these issues, I've been steadily employed for years and my current boss tells me I'm the best coder on the team, even better than them (their words)! Been going to therapy, and am a lot better now for it, and my therapist wants me OUT of this job. I've also been learning to pay more attention to my emotions and my needs, and that just ignoring things like this that so clearly bother me and suppressing my reaction like I've been doing is extremely unhealthy, which has been quite a joy. If any of that sounds familiar, I highly recommend counseling!",

    "text": "Need some opinions on micromanagement regarding hours worked Hey CS careers. I have a question for you guys about micromanagement.\n\nI first started as a contractor at my current company 4 months ago with the intention to convert to full time after 6 months as that's how long it would take for my company to be able to get me out from my vendor without having to pay them fees. However, I realized that being a contractor was much more profitable due to certain tax regulations and decided to stay on as a contractor long term which works out for everyone as the company doesn't need to pay benefits or vacation just salary while I get to pay less taxes. My vending company and my previous manager basically just said if you worked the day you bill 8 hours as a full day worked. Sometimes we'd do a bit more than 8 other times a bit less but we typically received glowing feedback and no one really penny pinched the hours. \n\nHowever, recently a new manager came in and it could be due to inexperience as this is his first time in an official management role but he said he's having talks with everyone about being more \"honest\" with hours billed. I can only infer this as he doesn't believe people are working a full 8 hours to the dot and wants to clamp down on what he perceives as dishonesty. I brought up my concerns to him about how in this industry isn't always so black and white with regards to man hours and results and it's often hard to quantify what's billable and what is not. I tried to explain that from my perspective it'd a lot easier for everyone that we just bill 8 work hours for a day under normal circumstances and there's no need to pay overtime for little things unless it's extreme circumstance like the day we spent 12 hours from 4pm to 4am on sunday to support a production launch.\n\nHis response was that if you're working at \"50%\" capacity then that time would count as billable and he wants everyone to keep track on a daily basis accurate to nearest half hour or something (didn't specify how accurate but wants more \"accuracy\"). He admits this straight micromanagement but it's something he wants to do. I asked him what about that one day where I spent 4 hours on call after work monitoring a release but only really spent 30min max on actual work while the rest of it was watching basketball or playing PC games which he said that would count even though it goes against what he just said.\n\nIn the end I asked him what exactly is so bad about what is being done currently which is to just treat everyone like a full time employee and pay 40 hours per week as the default pay. He sounded fairly upset when his response was: \"Well you're a contractor, you should be a salaried employee then if you want that\".\n\nAll in all I'm not happy about this at all. I never considered about hours worked and would happily assist off hours or respond to inquiries at night. Since he mentioned the 50% thing should I just type with 1 hand because that's 50%? Should I be calculating every minute I'm assisting with inquires to bill those hours? Where do I draw the proverbial line? Furthermore, what happens if I go to dentist or a doctor's appointment one day. Does he expect people to keep track of the exact time they left and when they come back? What motivation do I have to work on something faster if I can stretch out half a days work into a full days work? I also have a coworker who has a favourite coffee place about 20 min away and he often takes up to an hour to go there back. Wonder if that'll get clamped down too.\n\nAnyway, I just want to get some other people's opinion. Maybe I'm being unreasonable but I don't see how this can be a good thing for anyone and it just creates stress needlessly for all parties.",

    "text": "Spineless boss wants me to work with a bully I'm in a tough situation at work. I'm a consultant at a technology company.\n\nThis is kind of a vent or rant.\n\nMy boss is a 'golden retriever' personality. A nice enough fellow but probably among the worst bosses I've ever had. Aristotle once observed that a friend to everyone is a friend to no one. This sums my boss perfectly. He agrees with whomever he is speaking to so anything he promises you is essentially meaningless.\n\nI've worked out proposals with him, then walked into the meeting where he looks you in the eye when throwing you under the bus. He thinks he's being a great manager or diplomat by smoothing things over but actually he's being a lousy boss since you can't take him at his word for anything.\n\nA colleague and I both report to him.\n\nThis colleague was present during my job interview and had white knuckles over her mouth the entire time. I believe she suffers from [ambiguity intolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity_tolerance%E2%80%93intolerance). She has absolutely no ability to visualize anything remotely complex and in private, she needs to win conversations and does this by obstinacy and persistence until you get bored and go away. I know someone at the company where she used to work and he described her cunning but dense and and also an instigator. I've learned that she castrophizes anything I do. Of course, my boss being the spineless sort, always sides with the complainer. (Frankly, I could do her job.) She's also incredibly rude.\n\nSo, I have a big project designing complex designing of golden paths for users of this business product. It requires a bird's eye view of the product. For some reason, probably because it's a prestige project, he decided she should drive it even though she has the imagination of a brick and I've already done 99 per cent of the work. Frankly I'd sooner hand it off to another VP who's been working on with me since day one but that VP doesn't work in our department.\n\nI'm now at the hard one per cent: the executive summary levels and restructuring to put it all in logical order. Of course, because she literally cannot understand flow charts. Seriously.\n\nI'm doing what's asked but she's buttering the stairs and she's making me look bad through broken telephone tactics. (This would require a wall of text to detail so I shan't.)\n\nEven when I demonstrate to Golden Retriever that the work is being done *as he wants it done*, it for some reason doesn't count. Our boss wants to have a three-way conversation on Monday to get us to work together better because work is only successful between us when he's present and mediating.\n\nI am always open and helpful and try to focus on moving the ball forward.\n\n* My immediate idea is to put all these golden paths in a MS-Word document and hand it off to her.\n* She can be completely responsible for structuring what I've done. I know, of course, that she's not able and it will die a quick death but it could look like I am handing her a win. The result is I can go back to being productive.\n* I suspect that the bully is in an income trap. Her career is plateauing.\n\nNow, I'm a consultant and can fuck off at any time and do so with my head high. I've learned that as a consultant you have to be both wanted as well as needed but nearly every project I have worked on with her ends up taking three times as long because she needs to win every single sentence of every single conversation.\n\nI have work from other customers lined up but this company is close by and they pay well. And they just got bought by their competitor so there may be a chance to put air between me and the two of them at some unknown time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAn update. \n\nThe firm was bought a few months ago and the immediate decision was to halt all contracting so I am out of there. I struck up a consulting firm with a pal. He lines the clients up and I do the work. He's a great sales man and has doubled my hourly rate. As for the old firm, my spinless boss has picked up the nickname 'Mr No Balls' from two VPs with whom I have stayed in contact, and my ambiguity intolerant colleague apparently spends all day reading fashion web sites and throwing her team under the bus which, apparently is not going unnoticed.\n\nA clarification - when I say my boss is spineless I do mean that in the nicest way. He's probably an excellent team leader but is simply not  management material. He is far too agreeable and desperate to be liked. This rules him out as a senior manager and frankly, I think he's suffering in his current position.",

    "text": "Seeking Career Advice - Transitioning from Hands-On Developer to Leadership Roles. I, being an Android Developer myself, I am hoping other similar iOS, Android, and Web based UI / UX Engineers and Developers who have eventually transitioned to Leadership roles and responsibilities may be able to relate and suggest better.\n\nA little background about myself before I delve deeper into what's going on in my mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\*\\* Background \\*\\*\\_\\_\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI completed a Bachelors in Engineering (Honors) program from a very well reputed, rather ranked 1 amongst Private Educational Institutions in India, between 2000 and 2004. I had pursued a non Computer Science Bachelor's degree, however being an Honors program, the basics of C and Unix were part of the mandatory Curriculum. I then got placed in Campus Interviews, eventually been trained in all of the core Computer Science fundamentals including Data Structures, Algorithms, VB and Oracle Database concepts, and Worked for 3 years in India with a well reputed IT Services Consulting Company, on several projects with a variety of Banking, Finance and Capital Markets domain based Clients. I emigrated to the United States in 2007 with a valid approved H1-B Work-Visa, and ever since I have been working as a Software Consultant until recently, in September of last year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy career practically took off only in early-to-mid 2011 when I began working as an Hourly-Consultant for a major Investment Bank for their real-time Stock-Trading Platform Android Mobile Application. Until then, I was mostly dabbling with many Java and JEE Server-based technologies, frameworks, tools and applications at different Clients, again as an Hourly-Consultant. Ever since, I have been working as an Android Applications Developer, I have had the opportunity to work in Finance and Investment Banking Domain, as well as Audio/Video Media Rendering, building what I'd describe a very good career track. Recently, in September of 2018, I switched from working as an Hourly-Consultant, by accepting a Full Time Employment Opportunity at a major 24 x 7 News Media Corporation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\*\\* What I Fear \\*\\*\\_\\_\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had been pursuing Full Time Employment Opportunities since mid-to-late 2016, and I have had terrible Interview Experiences until thus far.\n\n1. I was once asked to solve a Crossword and/or Sudoku on a white-board, during a 45 min Technical Interview. I definitely did not stay dumb-and-numb, and attempted to give my best by beginning to write program code on the white-board speaking out my ideas and my decisions regarding the solution approach I was willing to take. Nevertheless, I never understood the intent of posing an incomplete question in a limited-time Interview.\n2. Time and again, I was expected to complete hands-on coding for a specific feature-set or full-functionality such as Expandable-Collapsible RecyclerView and CardView implementations on a primitive version of Android Studio IDE with incompatible / obsolete Android SDK and build-tools, command-tools Versions, within a limited time-frame during the Interviews, particularly without access to the internet, or even the local Android API Docs on the same machine that I was provided to complete the challenge, not to forget auto-complete disabled in the IDE altogether.\n3. More often than not, I was posed questions directed mainly toward third-party libraries - APIs, Components, Classes, Interfaces, even as far as Method Signatures, or a typical hypothetical scenario thrown at me and expected to guess what an Android Application and it's System are going to react in real-time.\n4. As a preliminary Technical Challenge prior to the Interviews, I was commonly expected to implement an end-to-end Project Functionality such as a Netflix Home Screen, and Video Detail Screen, you get the gist, within a short duration of say 2 hours, until I'd negotiate for at least a week-days time due to existing Hourly-Consultant Job-role commitments. However, if I were to really complete the Sample Project following miscellaneous \"Hello World\" style sample-programming methodologies within the given 2 hours, how was I showcasing that I am actually good at Large Scale Enterprise-style Android Application Architectures and implementations for Apps that reach out to Hundreds-of-Thousands, and Millions of Customers and User-base?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was only a sample of the type of Programming Interview Challenges that I had come across with 7 years of real-time hands-on Android Mobile App Development Experience, and a 14 year long stint in IT, a lot of which was in no way related to my day-to-day responsibilities, challenges that I had faced even as a Hourly-Consultant working in full-capacity with full-responsibility to ensure the Android Apps I was associated with were utmost stable and User-friendly. As I reckon, I believe that all, if not most of the Interviews were directed toward Rapid-Prototyping skills, while I on the other hand, I am a typical run-of-the-mill Android Developer that does not create a new Sample Project in Android Studio IDE every single day at my job in order to master developing a Netflix App within no time, rather focus on coordination, collaboration and completion of tasks and sprints as much ahead of time. I have begun to believe that a lot of the younger crowd, developers with less than 10 years, probably even less than 5 years experience are more suitable for real-time hands-on Coding roles, or the Rapid-Prototyping interviews, while I had practically drifted into more Senior Roles and Responsibilities, although that did not seem to translate well as intended due to my position as an Hourly-Consultant for the most part.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAndroid Programming particularly has not been easy either. Through out my career in so far as a Android Developer, I have noticed that Companies and Clients spend Millions of Dollars, only to be disappointed that Google and Android have introduced newer concepts, components, even programming paradigms - Fragments, Gradle, maven-dependencies, onslaught of third-party libraries that claim to promise faster and quicker development time, testing strategies, frameworks, tools, advanced UI features, animations, graphics and rendering, and most recently the Android Jetpack and Architecture Components, and androidx and kotlin. I mean, if a Million Dollar IT Project does not have a shelf-life of 2 years, then what good is technology even?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\*\\* What I Seek \\*\\*\\_\\_\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBetter late than never, I have anyhow moved-on to a Full Time Employment currently, but the memories of the Programming Interviews still give me the dreads. I am now committed to advance my career, away from hands-on core-programming and developer roles toward more matured Leadership roles. As a Full Time Employee working in a greater capacity but titled as a Senior Android Developer,\n\n1. What are the list of things I should learn, focus, improve so I can eventually completely drift-away from Programming, and land in roles of my liking with bigger-fatter pay-checks? Upwards of $200K? Or $250K? Twice as much fatter than now?\n2. How would I learn what kind of IT Leadership roles I am more suitable for, and create a liking for them?\n3. Is moving to a Leadership Role at my current Employer the only way for other potential employers to consider me seriously?\n4. What role does the Resume / Curriculum Vitae play in building my brand, and marketing for more Leadership roles, compared to Developer roles?\n5. How do I steer clear of a dead-end career track that is only gaining more competition as years pass?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; With 15 years in IT, and 8 years as an Android Developer, I certainly do not want to be writing Program-code on a Full-Time 40 Hours or more per week basis. Nor would I want to be considered strongly suitable only for such roles. Although, I am more comfortable being regarded as a suitable Developer that can fill-the-shoes when the time certainly comes. What is the next best thing that I should put my time and effort into, in order to realize my career objective to program-less and manage-more, and get paid accordingly?",

    "text": "What yo do when you lose someone's focus? I recently interviewed for a software engineer position at one the FANG's (for privacy purposes I won't mention the name of the company). I had 4 interviews with Software Engineers and Software Engineer Managers. In my opinion the first 3 interview went smoothly and I was able to answer all the questions and optimise my solutions (even I was writing on the white board my code was correct since I used to prepare for interview on a text editor instead of an IDE), even the system design interview which I was afraid of at first managed to have an optimised solution and had answered all of the interviewer questions correctly. The last interview was where I blew it in my opinion, this interview was online since the interviewer wasn't onsite. They connected me with him through a conference call. 10 seconds after the start of the interview the call got disconnected and I couldn't reconnect. So I went looking for someone to help me reconnect but that took 20min that I lost from my interview time. This got me super nervous and throw me off track, nevertheless I managed to get it together. The interviewer then asked me a coding problem which was vague, I had a problem understanding the coding problem and what was the interviewer waiting for in my solution, I tried to ask a lot of questions to clarify the question but every time the interviewer he answers me with \"Yeah sure\", which made me even more nervous. At one point he left for 5min and asked me to think about the edge cases. He came back we discussed my solution for a bit and how to optimise it, I gave him some ideas of how I could improve it of I had the time.\n3 days later I get an email that they're not going to extend an offer, which honestly after the last interview didn't have high hopes for.\n\nMy question is how do you deal with this if it happens to you during an interview?",

    "text": "Graduating In June, Dont Know Which Tech Path For Me, Please Help! Hello everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst and foremost, forgive me if I post this in the wrong sub or any other incorrectness, I'm really frustrated because I'm graduating soon and I dont know which tech path I should apply to and I cant find answers from my peers nor professors, and in my situation, I hope someone here can help me out. Please, bear with me, I really appreciate it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackground: background I'm an international student studying Management Information System in U.S. I'm graduating at the end of June and hoping to work in a real tech job anywhere in the U.S, preferably in California although right now I'm in Minnesota.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSchool curriculum: The school that I'm going to is not the best school for pursuing IT-related degrees but it is in my budget so there is that. In my opinion, the curriculum in my degree focuses on programming, we have to take 1 Python class (which is the pre-req class to weed out the \"unfortunate\" students I guess) then moving on to 1 Java class. In those classes we were given homework on code this and that, and the professors legit never check the homework so I use Chegg and Stack OverFlow on every home work including the exams, yes I know it is very bad because I didnt learn anything. Furthermore, 1 Python/Java algorithm class (I'm taking the Java class), 1 COBOL class, 2 databases (SQL) classes, 1 teaches SQL queries and the other one I had to develop a distributed database system (the scenario is to create databases for U.S and U.K using partition) that class got me hooked to database design and management, not only I had to create the DDBMS system, I also had to populate, queries, create stored procedures, crow diagram, just love it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat have I done: The school curriculum requires every student to have one internship, and luckily, I got one internship in one of the electrical co-ops in Minnesota. The place is not a software house and 80% employees are 40 years old above so they outsource every software and never have anyone create any in house software, so my internship felt like a class where my supervisor told me to make this and that except I got paid. The projects that I developed were:\n\n\\- Web database to store license keys (previously they were using Excel to store it and they want to have it in a web) I developed it using Django, literally using Django admin page and I designed the whole admin page to serve as a platform to store the license keys which my supervisor was very happy about it. I did not learn Django framework in class so I learnt that through YouTube and my supervisor said that it is good I can research and solve the project without help from him (thanks YouTube).\n\n\\- Web app where I find the discrepancies between 2 .csv files. So, every month, OATI software generates an excel file with the list of all \"members\" that pay and dont pay the electrical bills from that and the previous months, there were legit 20 columns and over 35.000 rows (not lying) and one of the \"business analyst\" went through those files each and every row (i have no idea how she does it without getting crazy) to see any discrepancies. So, I just had to make a web app that goes through the 2 .csv files and find members who dont pay the bills, I did not create the code at all, I legit put a chegg question for that project and through Stack Overflow, I didnt tell anyone, they just know I'm so good at coding which I'm not.\n\n\\- Arduino project to make a small car that can solve a maze (no, I dont know how to code it, I'm going to use someone else's code and hopefully improve it).\n\n\\- Codeacademy and Udemy courses for Data Science path and a Java course.\n\nIn my opinion, I know how to code on very simple basic tasks (For example, in the word \"ELEPHANT\" count how many \"E\" appears, or simple Codeacademy stuff), if I have to do advanced coding like bubble, selection, insert, I'm done, I cant do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm looking for: Through my experience in school and internship, I love when I have to design or develop databases, to me I understand way better than creating algorithm stuff, although I love to code to, to solve problems on a simple scale. So, what position should I apply for? Database administrator? Database developer? Business analyst? For sure not software engineer/developer because I honestly think I dont have the brain for it, I would definitely not pass the white board interviews. Last week, I went to a local career fair although its just one company, and they were demo-ing an automation stuff using Selenium, their positions are IT Quality Assurance, and to be honest, I'm very interested in what they do, it seems fun and easy although I dont know how to do it at all and I have been looking courses for Selenium but I couldnt find it. As for security, I'm going to take a security class in the Summer for only 1 term. Currently, I have been applying for database-related job, but if there is anything I'm missing, please do tell me. What positions should I apply for? If am posting in the wrong platform or sub, could anyone please point me out where should I post my question? Thank you so much for your time and help!",

    "text": "Discrimination in tech presentations Ok, this is not a troll post. Anyone who suggests/promotes: legal action, hateful speech, dramatization of situation, escalation, or extrapolation to other situations/trends; I don’t want to hear it. This is the first case I’ve heard and believe. Misogyny is far more common and a larger issue then misandry. Being a white man I do not experience discrimination so blatantly, this leaves me (thankfully) ill-equipped to deal with this so suggestions welcome.\n\n\nStory: my friend A, white male, is the core maintainer of an open source library. He was there from day 1 when there used to be a team around it. Team left now he is core contributor, with random people pitching in occasionally. He leveraged this library to do something cool and was about to demo it at a conference. I work at a big 5, so we have demo program managers. They barred him from presenting because “we have too many men presenting already”, however they still want to present the content so they will “find a woman”. This was collected in a call not recorded in text or otherwise.\n\n\nMy friend does many presentations. He is also a stud so he doesn’t really care, but it miffed him a little. He says this has happened before but subvertly, so its a little easier to swallow in past, also in other cases: there’s usually a woman on the team who can fill (justifiably so!) to ensure we can increase exposure and promote diversity (which is a good thing).\n\n\nThis case is different because 1) they literally said that shit in a call. 2) he’s the sole contributor at this point, they literally stripped his team and are still pushing this shit at conferences to look good. Now they want to find some random woman from some random team to present his work as her own.\n\n\nI’m working on something where I may be in his shoes shortly and curious how to mitigate.\n\n\nWhat would you do? How would you navigate politically? Thoughts/experiences? This ship has sailed but how would you prepare to mitigate risk in an environment like that for next time?\n\n\nAgain: please don’t make this political. Only practical advise. Again: if he had a woman on his team who contributed, totally fine. Again: this is my first experience with this in my 4 years at the company and 1 year on this team. I’ve seen many more cases of misogyny and feel more comfortable reporting that then something like this, especially with no evidence.\n\nHis manager already threw a fit and said at least give us a female head who can be dedicated to project (at least the demo) so she can present and be knowledgeable. PM refused and said he’d boot the demo from conference. Most parties want this demoed, pulling demo would be politically unwise for my friend and his manager, as the demo people can find another demo and management wants this demo presented.",

    "text": "8 months ago, I accepted a full-time role with a lower-end salary. One of my old contract-work companies offered me a full time role now with a higher salary. My current job came back with a crazy good offer, am I making mistake? Hi all. I'm using a throwaway because I have a lot of personal stuff on my regular account, but I would really value input from anyone who has been in this position or can give me insight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** Current company paid me $60k. After 8 months working there, a company I did freelance/contract work for offered me a full time job at $70,000 with better benefits and work-life balance. I turned in my two weeks on Friday, and yesterday my current company offered me $85,000 and a lead/manager/supervisory position to stay. I still want the new job / lower pay and I don't know if that's a mistake or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some background:**\n\nI'm 23, I graduated college two years ago with an unrelated degree. I've been working in webdev for several years as freelance/contract, though, and throughout college took gigs to pay my way through college as much as I could. Long story short, 8  months ago I was tired of working contracts/freelance and wanted a full time role.\n\nI did great in the interview, white boarding, etc. and was given a full time job offer at a corporation with an IT department that offers websites to their clients; I work alongside 2 other web developers who have been here for 3 years, 1 backend / database developer, and then I have a manager and a department head. This is kind of important later.\n\nThey offered me 55,000 starting out for salary, and I was able to get them up to 60,000 because I had two other offers for 60 and 65. Which where I live, is a starting salary for a junior developer. Even though I had done freelance/contract work in the past, so I had about 4 years experience - the portfolio and references to support it - this current job made me feel like they were taking a 'risk' in hiring me since I didn't have a 'conventional CS background' and agreed after 1 year with good performance, they'd bump me to 65,000.\n\nI have about 70k in student loans, which is also kind of important, but with my current salary I'm able to make my payments just fine.\n\nMy current job is very 'corporate', which is fine. However it can be a bit exhausting and redundant. We've had two slow periods now where I have had maybe 3-4 sites in a 3 month period. I also learned from my manager and two of the other web developers that a few years ago, everyone took a dip in their salary in order to keep the company afloat and prevent any layoffs. No one has gotten a raise since then, including the web developers who have been there 3-4 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Currently**\n\nOne of my old companies I did contract work for contacted me. Their lead front end developer is starting a family and will be leaving her role in 3 months. They want someone to come in under her, learn what she knows and what she's got going on, and then take over that lead role once she leaves. They contacted me first before posting the job, because they have worked with me in the past and know that I know the stack and liked my work.\n\nThis company is a digital marketing agency, very 'modern', offers a lot of great things - like fully remote work after a period of time, tuition reimbursement, a new laptop, etc. that I don't get with my current job. They offered me $70,000 and after I take over the lead developer's position, we will sit down and re-discuss the salary. This is all in writing, in the contract/offer letter they sent me, among all the other great things they promised.\n\nThe company is stable, has been around for 15 years, the people are hilarious and great, the environment is very 'relaxed' (compared to where I am now) and all the employees who are there end up staying for a long time, which is why they couldn't offer me a full time role 8 months ago when I began looking for a full time position (I had spoken to them about this before job searching, because I love the company and the people there).\n\nSounds perfect, right? Clients and work I'm excited about, aptitude for growth, and a relaxed policy that gives me a lot of autonomy.  The benefits are also much better and they are just overall a great company and people with really exciting projects and clients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*WELL.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI turned in my resignation on Friday after happily accepting the offer at the new company. Yesterday, I had a meeting with my company's CEO and department head and they were not excited about me leaving, and were almost in panic mode.\n\nThey counter-offered me with a lead/supervisor position, with $85,000 salary, and in 6 months a meeting to discuss further increases in salary.  I did not tell them the salary I was offered or the company I was going to (I just simply said I was given a competitive offer and I think it better propels me in my personal and professional goals), and that's what they came back with. I'd be over-seeing the other developers, who have been there for several years, which ... I'm not sure how I feel about.\n\nIn addition to THIS, the manager (not supervisor) told EVERYONE at the company the day I turned in my resignation, saying I got a really good offer somewhere else so I'm leaving. So now, the other developers who have been there for years without raises will know I was given a raise that's pretty good, enough to keep me to stay. This makes me feel... well, uncomfortable I guess. I feel like there is going to be some toxicity because I know they haven't gotten raises in years, and I was just offered a 25k raise after being there 8 months.\n\nIt all just sounds 'too good to be true' and extremely strange to me. They gave me the whole rundown about how valuable I am, how I've proven through my work I know what I'm doing, how I've helped them with huge clients and retaining $500k-$750k clients with their business, etc. and they can't afford to lose me.\n\nWhen I mentioned that I was wary about the raises being far and few between (prior to them making this offer in the interview) they said something to the effect of, 'those developers do the bare minimum and we honestly see you as a lead developer already, which is why we give our big clients to you. You go above and beyond what we expected... etc etc etc.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey gave me until today to make a decision, and I still feel like I want to take the new job / lower paying job. Like I said, I have student loans, so the extra money is super helpful, however I feel like the opportunity for growth at the new company is there enough so that I'll make that money within a year and a half, if not sooner when I finish training for the lead role they want me to take over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo am I being paranoid, or is that whole counter-offer kind of... strange? I've never head of anything like it, and I appreciate that they even made a counter, but holy shit - that's a huge jump. I feel in my gut I would be much happier at the new job, I would be able to grow, and I would be passionate about my work. But am I stupid for doing this, considering how much money my current job offered?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess I just want to hear what peoples thoughts are, what they think about the situation, or if anyone has been in a similar position. At the end of the day, it isn't alllll about money, and the new company offers me intangible things that are beyond a salary amount. But considering my student loans, I feel kind of  weird about taking less money. I don't know. I feel scrambled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you read this all thank you lol",

    "text": "I fucked up at Big 4 and now I don’t know where to go. Advice would be appreciated! I have bad anxiety and imposter syndrome. Before and after I graduated from college, I had a really cool-sounding 8-month internship where I learned very little and made enough moolah to buy a car and make a down payment for a townhouse - it was like interning at the White House. I was given my OWN office, had 2 hours of real work per day, read a bunch of books during work per my boss’s request, and attended important meetings and shadowed upper mgmt. I worked 35 hours per week and people liked me. The agency really only gives full-time offers to folks with PhDs. Also the agency provided me with free housing across the street. \n\nThis internship helped me land a FT offer at Big 4 audit. I had already accepted an offer but decided to go Big 4 when they hired me right before the Christmas holidays. I think I made my internship sound a lot more challenging than it really was. When I started, I was shocked. I’d been told I’d be on a client closer to home but then was placed on a different one. My commute was a minimum of 3 hours per day, I could never leave work before 8pm. At the time it felt outrageous to leave home at 6am and come home at or after 10pm..everyday. On top of it all, one midnight I slipped on ice and chipped my hip bone, for which I went to the ER. I hadn’t brought home my laptop that night because I thought I’d be back in the office by 9 the next morning. I ended up missing work that Friday and weekend. Everyone on my team freaked. I spent the rest of busy season with a poor attitude because I had trouble sitting and walking. Then I missed the weekend before filing after having worked two consecutive weeks of 14 hours/day. I know everyone was working even longer hours but i was on the verge of death. I had never before worked even 40 hours a week so to work 60+ hours/week beginning in the first week was hell. \n\nAfterward my team just hated me - with good reason.  I didn’t understand it at the time but now I do. I received a shitty annual review and then even shittier ones going forward. Eventually I quit because my manager hated me and also because I’d only spent a week recovering from surgery rather than the recommended 6 weeks. \n\nI’ve found a job in industry that has the downsides hours-wise of Big 4 (9-8pm is the norm) without many of the upsides (career advancement). I’m in a constant state of anxiety because I was told I was shit at Big 4 and also because I haven’t told anyone about my chipped hip during Big 4. People expect a lot from me and I constantly feel dumb. \n\nI feel like my resume makes me appear smarter than I am. Everyone asks me about my White House-esque internship, my photos with Joe Biden-like celebs, and are also impressed by my accomplishments. Then they realize that I can barely run pivot tables and that I dislike working overtime. I was an English and Russian double major goddamn it. I wasted too much time reading Tolstoy and not enough time dabbling in Excel.",

I 100% will never work in audit again, I think I would take a job at McDonald's over working in audit seriously, I hate the nature of the job and I am not good at it, much more a sales/people person. I'm pretty close to quitting anything accounting-related altogether, but I just got contacted by a recruiter for an advisory position (accounting advisory). Advisory is the only thing public accounting I will consider at this point, being that it is further away from debits and credits and rule checking, and closer to finance/deal-making/client-focused.\n\nBeing that I am more interested in finance and deal-making, when I first went into accounting, this was my long term goal, to start in audit and make the transition into advisory (I learned that not all advisory is the same), and then eventually into high finance. I am not sure how much client facing and strategy is involved in \"accounting advisory\" as opposed to transaction services or strategy consulting; my goal is to get as far away from journal entries and accounting BS and closer to bottom line figures, growing future revenue, and closing deals.\n\nSo I have a few questions, for anybody who has experience in advisory:\n\n1. For those who have worked in advisory, how much different/better is it than audit? (I know better/worse is subjective, but audit is generally known to be the shittiest of accounting jobs, or even financial services jobs as whole. Low pay, no respect, nobody likes you, the \"janitors\" of the white collar world I have heard it described lol)\n\n2. If you have little talent/desire for tickmarking workpapers, being the regulatory compliance guy who's up everyone's a$$, hate law/regulation/administrative BS, but like interacting with people, and even a good amount of number crunching and finance, will I also struggle in accounting advisory? Is it one of the advisory lines that is just a \"glorified auditor\", and am I going to be doing the same thing again?\n\n3. How much does traveling all the time suck? The idea of it sounds fun, but I'm not sure how much of a toll it will take on my health, fitness, relationships, etc. I like to be a gym guy, maintain muscle mass, get back to my room, my temple, play with my electronics/toys, etc. maybe a year of traveling to new cities will do me well and grow me as a professional, but I also read about people who despise traveling all the time.\n\n4. Is it generally harder or easier than audit? Almost everyone I've met who works in advisory tells me it's way better and more interesting than audit work, just flat out objectively better, but I worry that I won't have the talent to perform in a position like this if I hate audit/accounting in general. I just like wearing a suit and working with people, and I love all things finance. Audit was hard for me because you have deadlines to meet while waiting on documentation/information from the client, management is upset because you have no work until the information arrives, so you look like you're slacking off, you have to be pushy/annoying, the processes are so tedious and pointless (to me at least), ex: check if this entry was properly recorded in the right time period, and was properly capitalized or expensed, or this entry was unusually high, you must question this and ask client for documentation/backup, meanwhile I'm thinking OMG who the F cares lol, let them record it how they want lmao. Of course, my job is to make sure they are following the rules, but I hate being that guy. I wanna help you grow your business, not the compliance nerd who's telling the principal that the jocks are cutting class and smoking pot and getting BJs in the parking lot. Nobody likes that guy.\n\n5. CPA exam: is the CPA exam as desired in advisory fields as it is in audit? I hate this exam and I would love any excuse to stop studying, and I absolutely do not want to be an accounting guy long term. I only wanted the CPA as a ticket into finance, but the more I learn, it's not even as desired in the finance field as I originally thought. Another question: if the CPA is still a good idea, how realistic is studying for this test while working full time in advisory, flying back and forth between different states each week?\n\nSorry for language, I tend to get overly angry/expressive when I think about my job in audit lol. Cliffs:\n\n-OP might be moving from audit to advisory\n\n-OP hates audit (accounting is boring too, but especially hates audit)\n\n-OP is not good at audit, not a natural accounting/audit type\n\n-OP is hoping advisory (accounting advisory) is closer to OP's natural interest and talent (people skills and finance)\n\n-OP wonders if he will be good enough or if he will be miserable again with a higher paycheck\n\n-OP wonders how good/bad the travel is\n\n-OP seeks anybody in r/accounting's advice who has worked in audit and accounting advisory or both, or has any input/knowledge",

    "text": "From CIB to Big 4 Hi all, \n\nI just wanted to collect some opinions on my current situation, in case anyone has already gone trough something similar.\n\nA few months ago, I joined a Big 4 in a non-client facing position. My primary background is in corporate & investment banking where I was client facing. The reason that pushed me to leave my former job were more practical (low salary, limited progression, questionable environment, high turnover). Yet, during my time in banking, I kept reaching one high after another leading to constant positive feedback from clients, senior management, country heads etc, awards etc..My local management (middle-management) seemed however underwhelmed and didn't have the same level of enthusiasm for some reason.\n\nI thus decided to leave my former banking position to move into this Big 4 one ... I deem it to be the worst mistake I could have ever done career-wise. I'm almost 6 months in and although I understand there is a reasonable adaptation time, it seems I'm not adapting. I went from being a high-achiever in a client-facing role, to an incompetent individual in an internal role. \n\nThere are no procedures and processes in place. One day it's black, the next it's white. You get ratty responses from contractors offshore, local managers and other stakeholders. Limited training. When you ask a question, it's either \"I don't have time\" or \"I don't know\". No one cares how you're doing or progressing as a new comer. You're being given a project with incorrect information which you have to feed to other stakeholders and thus end up losing credibility. \n\nIt's a headache. I've dealt with demanding CFOs/directors/MDs in banking and no one ever said they didn't have the time or sent me a ratty response. I managed to build relationships with higher management very quickly in banking, which does not seem to be happening here. The job in itself is not hard and certainly does not even compare to the amount of pressure I had in banking. This is nothing. However, the hostile atmosphere is hard to dealt with. The job is extremely boring as well. I'm depressed and certainly don't recognize myself. I lost all of my confidence, I'm not the bubbly/shiny person I once was in banking. I cry every day at work, which is not normal as I probably cried 3 times during my 4 years prior to this.\n\nHas anyone ever moved from industry to Big 4 to realize they made a mistake? Was it easy to move back into industry?\n\nThanks.",

    "text": "Is My Career Irreparably Damaged? Should I Give Up on this Profession? I am an accountant who has had a difficult life and did not graduate from college at a traditional age. I worked for many years managing a small store and doing physical labor in a not-so-ideal industry for a young lady. I left a semi-abusive living situation with an underachieving, substance abusing significant other to move back in with my abusive dad and dysfunctional family when I went back to school. It was not easy to deal with the environment of my childhood home again, and although my dad was delighted to have me back at first, the household soon reverted to its dysfunctional, abusive ways. I still worked part time and sometimes full time at the same job, save for my last semester at school. My family was pretty awful to me and made things difficult every step of the way. Despite this, I worked incredibly hard in school and flourished in my classes. I immersed myself in Accounting like it was a religion. I was determined to be successful, to finally be somebody who was deserving of respect and acknowledgment.\n\nI went to the meetings of professional organizations as a student, earned the ACFE scholarship and built my overall GPA (which had been tarnished when I’d dropped out of school the first time) back up to a respectable B+. My Accounting GPA was an A. Because I went to the local extension of a fairly well-known state school and worked much of my way through college, it was not adequately impressed upon me how important certain opportunities were and I was personally naïve and ignorant, coming from a working class background and living in an industrial, mostly working class area. I was older than the traditional students but younger than the older ones who had went back to college after their kids were bigger or grown. I wanted more than anything to work for Big 4 and considered not getting into Public career suicide and the end of my life. But I did not realize how important internships were and focused hard on having a perfect GPA. I was also ignorant how far in advance you had to apply to Big 4 firms or even regional firms to nail down a role upon graduation.\n\nThe summer I graduated was a disaster. My parents would threaten and scream at me all the time. I immersed myself in an eating disorder (dropping more weight despite already being quite thin) and passing the CPA exam – one of my last and most cherished dreams back then. Unfortunately, the summer ended with me being sexually assaulted at a house party in a scenario similar to the Brock Turner case. I made the naïve mistake of reporting the assault, and that’s when the bottom fell out. Everything they tell you about how awful sexual assault victims are treated is true, but I had no idea at the time. I thought receiving help for wrongs committed against you is just something that happens and that reporting a crime was the logical thing to do. I was forced to drive back to the city where the assault occurred by myself to report my story at the police station after I got home from the hospital and took a shower. The police officer was a young guy who literally smirked at me the entire time as I conveyed the events that occurred as best as I could. But since I remembered very little of what actually happened, it was difficult.\n\nStudying for and focusing on passing the CPA exam literally got me through my sexual assault. At the time, I passed every section except FAR, which was the one I was studying for when the assault actually occurred. I spent as little time as possible at my parents’ house, but if my dad woke up when I quietly tiptoed into the house late at night after hours of studying, he would pin me against a wall and scream in my face with unbridled rage. My mental state, which was already poor, deteriorated rapidly. My sister and her husband who had just moved overseas wired me some money and I opened a new bank account in my name only and transferred the small amount of money I already had into it and also applied for a credit card. They also found an old friend from school who was looking for a roommate and lived in the major city next to our hometown. I snuck most of my possessions out of my parents’ home while they were driving my younger brother back down to school and stayed at a friend’s house for a month until I could move to the city. My dad had already told me to get the eff out of his house and to make sure I took all my sh\\*t with me because I was not welcome back.\n\nThe day I moved there was a major blizzard. It was just me and my Budget rent-a-van. I had to go back to my dad’s house to get some of the items I’d left behind. He would not let me take my bed, mattress or any dressers. I slept on a cheap, uncomfortable futon and lived out of plastic storage tubs for years after moving to the city. He helped me carry heavier things out, but screamed at me and called me a b\\*tch and a c\\*nt while doing it. All I can say is the move was incredibly difficult, downright harrowing actually. I unloaded the entire the van by myself, carrying loads of boxes and heavy items up three flights of stairs. I got back on the road and exited a major thoroughfare shortly before it was blocked off and cars were stranded on it, frozen to the road overnight. Looking back, I was incredibly lucky, but it was not over yet. I managed to get the emptied van back to the rental facility in the suburbs, but there was fishtailing and white knuckles the whole way, as I prayed I wouldn’t lose control of the vehicle. My car was buried in a snow bank and the tow truck that responded was manned by an inexperienced teen who ended up bending my front tire rod. I was towed to and stayed at a nearby hotel that did not offer me a discount or pity of any kind. It was expensive, and I had to put all this on my new credit card. I shivered in my hotel room wrapped in a towel, sweaty and wet clothes drying on the shower curtain rod (spoiler alert: they were not dry the next day). I had a phone interview with a regional accounting firm the next morning but it probably didn’t go well, considering the circumstances. Then I drove back to the city on a sheet of ice, and my car kept pulling to one side due to the bent tire rod I was unaware of at the time. Other cars were speeding like nothing had happened, riding my bumper and putting me in danger. It was a miracle I didn’t lose control of the car and made it home safely.\n\nI was so shell-shocked after my ordeal that I did not leave my new room for two weeks. I desperately tried to apply and interview for retail jobs in fancy shopping malls downtown, just as a means to survive. The interviews didn’t go too well, since I felt like a cardboard cutout trying to convey human enthusiasm and emotion. I had other accounting interviews I had applied for before the move but did not get the roles due to lack of experience or probably interview skills. I was eventually contacted by a major accounting temp agency but was only offered semi-clerical, data entry AP stuff that was disguised as an accounting role. The headhunters made it seem like this is how everyone started out and that I was lucky for the $10/hr no-benefits temp roles they were offering. The rep would talk like the guy in the Micro Machines commercials when describing the assignment and on the spot ask me if I accepted without divulging the name of the company until I had done so. When I left one assignment because I was offered a somewhat more career relevant role at a more promising company, the rep berated me over the phone before hanging up on me. I was just a scared young lady alone in a large city with broken dreams and the aftermath of a sexual assault still hanging over her head. Having been in the industry for years now, I definitely know this was NOT how most successful accountants start their careers and avoid working with temp agencies at all costs. I actually despise headhunters and consider them the lowest form of humanity. I was barely living hand to mouth, making less than when I was uneducated and managing the small store that was in an area with a much lower cost of living. I’d also surprisingly had health and vision insurance back then but now had none. I felt powerless, trapped and used but had few options at this point in my career.\n\nI worked hard and climbed the ladder from the absolute bottom and made it despite all odds. There were lots of struggles and compromises along the way, including a layoff I had to bounce back from as well as unfair treatment by more fortunate but immature and petty peers (early in my career, I worked at a major start up in my city filled with mostly young people).\n\nI made a bad career move at the beginning of this year and had to quit for my health and sanity after only 90 days. It was a major company, and I thought the role would be an interesting change of pace. I soon discovered the department was understaffed and known for high turnover. A manager was brought in around the same time that I started who was there to push deadlines that had not been made in the past due to inadequate staffing. He acted like he was a nice guy who was interested in our goals and career, but he was also controlling and manipulative, pushing us hard to meet the deadlines no matter what. People were frequently sick and extremely stressed out, but many of them could not quit because it was their first job out of school. I’m not old but I’m no spring chicken and could not hang in that type of sweatshop environment with some guy pacing the cubicle aisles and tapping me on my shoulder to constantly ask my status.\n\nI am having an incredibly difficult time bouncing back. I’m trying to make the jump to and have a last salary that’s around Senior level. I’ve been told my resume and background is impressive by both colleagues and recruiters and know I’m an excellent interviewer, as I’ve been told so on multiple occasions and have worked hard to develop that skill. I am getting responses from quality, major companies but only make it through the phone screen. Oftentimes the recruiter says my background is impressive and he’ll keep me in mind for future opportunities. But I’m only getting in-person interviews at lackluster companies where I would not want to work (the toxic vibes and messy processes come through during the interview). I’m talking to a major company for a decent contract role right now and just quit a menial but well paid contract role at an extremely dysfunctional company. I’m worried I’m going to be relegated to contract roles or permanent roles at crappy, inefficient companies from now on due to this one misstep. I already had the layoff that I repeatedly have to explain on interviews and now this.\n\nI guess I’m tired of the perfectionism that’s expected in Accounting, not just while in a role but even when it comes to your career history. I feel like not having Big 4 or regional experience is a permanent strike against you and you are always going to be looked over or have to fight extra hard for roles that those with that experience get much more easily. So many doors open for you if you have Big 4 and it seems elitist and incredibly unfair. And If I’m truly honest with myself, I find Accounting dry and unsatisfying and working in an office stifling for similar reasons as these posts: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9ybn40/anyone\\_else\\_depressedfeel\\_out\\_of\\_placenot\\_sure\\_if/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/9ybn40/anyone_else_depressedfeel_out_of_placenot_sure_if/) and [https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7k4wy3/is\\_my\\_accounting\\_job\\_causing\\_depression\\_or\\_am\\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7k4wy3/is_my_accounting_job_causing_depression_or_am_i/)\n\nI feel trapped and anxious sitting at a desk all day and sometimes even miss slinging cases of beer for a living (but not the customers, haha). If I don’t keep a strict exercise routine to maintain core strength, my body is a mess of knots and tightness and I get debilitating tension headaches. One masseuse said I had the worst shoulder knots she’d ever seen. I also don’t relate that well to others in my field. When we took a team lunch minus our manager, one of my peers said I looked like an artist and everyone else immediately chimed in in agreement. Actual artist friends said they were surprised I’m an accountant and give off artist vibes. When we took a personality test at my last job, I got Rockstar personality with Innovation and Emotion as my top strengths and Prestige as my weakness. Most others had Prestige as their dominant trait and Emotion as their weakness. It appears to me that I’m much more affected by the stress, intense pressure and deadlines while others seem much less reactive and emotional. Oftentimes I feel like an emotion spewing volcano about to explode and an eccentric, counterculture weirdo surrounded by fairly unemotional straight laced types following traditional life and career paths. It’s like my abusive dad is in my head yelling at me that I’m a headcase (too emotional and depressive) and will never amount to anything. I’m getting closer to 40 and am blessed to have no student loan debt. I really don’t want to set out on a new career path at my age. So here I am continuing to hammer my neon colored, round peg self into that square corporate hole. I am well liked by my peers and love telling zany stories and jokes to entertain and make them laugh. People typically like me and I have allies down to the maintenance and janitorial staff. But I often catch the ire of no-nonsense, overly intense higher ups.\n\nMaybe there is room for offbeat types in Accounting. I keep telling myself that. But it can feel isolating at times and I am so tired of the song and dance of interviewing and having to explain career holes and missteps over and over. I’m praying I land something before I run out of money, which is going to happen in the next month or so. My retirement fund and savings have already been gutted. I desperately need health insurance and a permanent role at company that is not crazy or an environment that is not borderline sweatshop. Any advice or solidarity would be welcome. Thanks to anyone who got through reading this novella of a post.\n\nPS - I did retake and pass FAR shortly after moving to the city and obtained my CPA!",

    "text": "First generation college graduate in need of some career advice Hi. Im a first generation college graduate and with this I dont really have anyone I can talk to about work issues. My mom doesn't think shes able to provide any advice since she's never had a white collared job. Hopefully I can get some help here. \n\nFirst some general details: I am 23. Ive been out of college for a year and a half. I worked throughout college in a part time internship, to a full time internship,  to my first full time accounting role. I quit my first job right after graduating because I was really underpaid. After that I took a job with a small non for profit that was really shady and doing unethical things, I got fired from this job for saying no to some things I was asked. Next I got a non accounting job working with homes about to go into foreclosure. It was a call center job and I really wanted to get into the underwriting department there but I couldn't take the stress and I moved on to the job I have now. Ive been at this new company for maybe 4 months and this is where I'm having my current issues.\n\nI have bipolar depression. It is a big part of my life and Ive spent the majority of my depressed. I honestly don't enjoy many things I try to not look be visibly miserable most of the time so I mainly just keep to myself. I am not a peppy person at all and acting happy is really hard/ tiring for me. \n\nThe people at my job annoy the hell out of me. Most people are fakely happy and over enthusiastic. Which is fine. I say my good mornings and how are you like everyone else but I try to stay in my cube. Ive had work places with people like this before with no issue. \n\nA big issue I seem to have is my job wants me to be more \"involved.\" I am an accountant. I do the work I need to and I collaborate with the people I need to in order to get work done but that's not enough for them. \n\nWe have a ridiculous amount of meetings. The accounting team had a 15 minute meeting daily, we have one on one meetings with our managers  weekly, and two full hour long staff meetings biweekly. My manager keeps pressuring me to join the group more and collaborate but I really dont have anything more to say. I speak up about work things and have no problems asking questions. I can act happy and like I care about their social lives for short periods of time but I feel like they're really just asking for me to be someone else. \n\nI feel like they make up work, it reminds me of clubs in high school. Like the meetings become more work because we need to find things to talk about to fill up the meeting times rather than meeting for what's needed. Everyone in accounting is also basing forced to host and present a luncheon to the whole company. Its ridiculous extra work for no reason. \n\nAt my last one on one meeting with my manager she implied that I need to smile more and be more approachable. This rubbed me the wrong way. I told her that this is only an issue because of my race and that they're not other nonchalant people in the office that keep to themselves but it's not a problem with them because they're white men. This lead to talk with HR. They pretty much gave me the general spiel that they love diversity and all the other buzz words. I told them that they aren't accepting my diversity by expecting me to change and that I'm just someone that focuses and enjoys working. \n\nI definitely feel like my disability is a big part of this but I also think it's unreasonable to be expected to be a different person 40 hours a week at work. I've thought about telling HR about my bipolar depression and asking for some sort of accommodations?\n\nWhat should I do? Do I tell HR about my disability and hope they give me some slack? Is it too soon to start looking for another job? If I do start applying  to other places do I leave this one on my resume or take it out? How to I explain my short work history? Do you think im the problem?",

    "text": "PSA- Check your moles! Unfortunately, many people (including dermatologists) don’t know that black skin does not offer sufficient protection from skin cancer. Melanoma is the most dangerous skin cancer, and while it has an extremely good prognosis when diagnosed early, the chances of survival plummet the longer a cancerous mole goes untreated.\n\n\nWhile black people have a lower risk of skin cancer compared to people with other skin colours, their risk of getting an initial diagnosis of an already advanced melanoma is much higher than for white and hispanic people. On top of that, many medical professionals aren’t adequately educated on how melanoma might present in black people and so might miss it during check-ups: it is often found on the soles of the feet, the palms of the hands or under/near the nails (that’s the type of melanoma Bob Marley had). It also doesn’t help that most references for “melanoma” depict melanoma on pale skin. \n\nI’ve tried to collect relevant information on how to prevent and check for melanoma in this post. I am not a medical professional myself, this information might not be comprehensive, it’s just meant to be a general first look at the topic. Please talk to your GP or dermatologist if you have any concerns.\n\n\n\n**How to prevent skin cancer**\n\n\n-Wear sunscreen: While a higher level of melanin in the skin increases sun protection, it doesn’t come close to the protection sunscreens can offer.\n\n-Stay out of the direct sunlight, especially in the hours between 10-4.\n\n-Wear a hat and cover as much skin as possible with clothing.\n\n-Go to a yearly skin cancer prevention check at a dermatologist’s office.\n\n-**Do not** listen if someone tells you you’re low risk because of your skin colour. If you have a history of skin cancer, make sure to follow your doctor’s orders if they recommend more frequent check-ups.\n\n\n**How to check moles**\n\n\n- Follow the **ABCDE**-rule: A-Asymmetry: asymmetric moles have a higher chance of being skin cancer; B-Border: moles with a fuzzy border have a higher chance of being skin cancer, C-Colour: moles with several different colours have a higher risk of being skin cancer, D-Diameter: moles with a diameter of more than 6mm have a higher risk of being skin cancer; E-Evolving: if a mole changes size, becomes raised, starts bleeding or itching or suddenly develops different colours, it has a higher risk of being skin cancer. Some websites add an F for Funny to the rule: if anything feels strange or different, get it checked out. You know your body best.\n\n-Take pictures! It helps a lot with identifying any changes.\n\n-Make sure to check spots like the inside of your mouth and your genital area and buttcrack. Having a partner check your back makes this a lot easier. \n\n-Self-check every few weeks/months.\n\n\n**What not to do**\n\n\n-Never try DIY-removing a mole. There are people online who seriously recommend cutting it out with scissors or putting vinegar on it. Please don’t do that- 1. It’s incredibly unsafe 2. If a doctor is concerned about a mole, they will send it in to be biopsied. If you destroy the mole, you’re also destroying the chance of getting it analysed.\n\n\n-Don’t ever ignore a mole itching or bleeding. That’s doctor time. \n\n\n\n**These are really good articles talking about melanoma in black women- they have more information**\n\nhttps://www.self.com/story/black-people-melanoma-skin-cancer\n\nAnd  https://www.health.com/melanoma/dark-skin-is-no-protection-from-skin-cancer\n\n\n**Other things you can do**\n\n-Make sure your GP/dermatologist is aware that melanoma can show up differently and in different spots on black skin compared to lighter skin. This is especially important if you live in a country with an overwhelmingly non-black population, where doctors might have even less experience in diagnosing skin cancer in black people.\n\n-Mark the date of your last skin check-up in the calendar so you’re not late on your yearly check-up (I do this and still managed to be three months late -.-)\n\n-Talk to friends and family about melanoma and share articles you think are valuable about it on Facebook or post them in Whatsapp-groups- raising awareness is so important\n\n-If you swim in the sea a lot: there is reef-friendly sunscreen, some sunscreens can unfortunately damage maritime life.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps someone! I’m white and don't want to intrude, so I won’t comment on this post unless I get tagged, so if you want me to reply to your comment, please do so. You can also message me privately if you want to, but as I said, I’m not a doctor and unqualified to help with specific medical issues. If I have missed anything vital or you have any more resources you’d like included in this post, please comment or message me and I’ll edit my post. I am also not an English native speaker, so I’m sometimes a bit wobbly with my terminologies- please call me out if I phrased anything badly.\n\nHope all of you have a nice day!",

    "text": "Racism and sexualization I experienced at Child Care Job Racism and sexualization I experienced at Child Care Job\n\nI’m a mixed black woman living in a very white Midwestern state. Recently, I was a child care worker at a super white and Trump supporting day care (didn’t know it when first applying for job) and I have never experienced such blatant racism! A lot of the white People were shocked to see I was working there and they reacted by ignoring me, giving me a dirty look to my face, talking about me in front of my face, and watching my every move to make sure I didn’t steal, lie or abuse the kids. They acted like I was the first black person they ever interacted with. They were envious I was in graduate school and ate healthy  also. Everytime a kid would cry, a worker would rush to my room and ask the kid what was happening. I felt like I had to always smile and not show any negative emotion like anger in order to make them comfortable and not fearful. I swear that job added to my ptsd.  One mother of a child saw me, ignored me, then asked another worker who was going to be looking after her baby (definitely implying she didn’t want me to). Also the child care workers told me to make sure I wore conservative clothes and to not flirt. While some of the other workers came in yoga pants and flirty and the managers didn’t say anything. They assumed I would be hypersexual and try to steal husbands or something! Then the child care director tried to figure out my insecurities and make me feel inferior/insecure by bragging about blonde women with blue eyes then watching me to see my reaction. It’s like she didn’t like seeing how I was happy, successful and black at the same time.\n\nThen after working for some time, a lot of the white fathers of the children started sexualizing and had crushes on me which made the white women more mad. What made me quit, though, was when a couple assumed I had abused their kid because she all of the sudden started having accidents (peeing). When his daughter was probably having accidents because of their marital concerns—- the husband cheated on his wife with the other day care workers and was trying his hardest to get with me. The father was also a police officer. And then the white co-workers became envious the police officer liked me because they all wanted him so they got even meaner and tried to sabotage me. I am betting they were telling the police officer lies about me being dangerous or crazy or something which is another reason the girl’s parents assumed the worst—that I was abusing her. \n\nWhat confused me was he was obviously racist (he didn’t acknowledge the other black woman worker) but acted like he was in love with me. but I think he was only nice to me because he thought I was attractive. Or then i wondered if it was a colorism thing but I doubt it because I was like the same skin color as her in the summer. I wonder if they were stereotyping me based on jezebel stereotype or sexualized mullato (although I doubt they knew I was mixed)?\n\nI also had no one to turn because the day care director was the most racist of all and would direct her workers to watch me. She would let her white workers come in late but was hard on me if I did. \n\nI feel hurt and angry Thinking about my experience at this job especially so because it confirmed that white people reject me, see me as other, and as a threat no matter what I do and who I am.\n\nWorst job. Should have made a complaint  for discrimination and reported them. Anyone relate or have similar experiences while working at child care?\n\nEdit: As for the parents assuming I abused their kid.. there was definitely racism and stereotypes going on there. But I also have to say, during that time, I was very emotionally unstable. I had just moved out of my abusive parents’ Home out on my own, financially independent for the first time. I was victim blamed from my family for my dad’s sexual abuse so I didn’t have any support system. Also, I already had trauma reactions from past racial discrimination. So being around all these white People made my ptsd alive and I was super hypervigilant, had major mood swings, was dissociating, and would sometimes be standoffish and other times friendly. It’s important I mention this because this played a factor in my treatment. But I still wouldn’t have been this mistreated if I was white. And I know this because there was a white girl that started right after me who was often angry, yelled at the kids, and was emotional.. but they didn’t care. And they weren’t watching her constantly or checking her kids in the room frequently.\nAlso, I forgot to mention, when I first applied the director almost was warning me about the location. Because she said, “this location is very Lilly white. Maybe you would prefer our other more diverse location since you are going to graduate school for social work.” Basically this woman segregated her child care centers. One was all white and the other was diverse. I was the first black woman to work at her “white” center.",

At work today I had to handle shipping and handling for UPS in the copy center at Staples. This middle aged white woman comes in with a present that's not wrapped and wants to ship. I tell her she needs to get a box from the mail and ship aisle to have it packed up.\n\nAs I'm processing her shipment I notice how pushy she is. \"It has to get there by Thursday\" as if I have complete control over that. I ask for her contact information and she says it's going to her daughter. Um okay most packages have a to and from address. Then she gets annoyed because I had to start over because I couldn't find her daughter's contact information in our system mind you took two seconds.\n\nI show her the full price including tax, packing fee, and the box. Tell me why she fucking flipped at the check out and demanded to know about the packing fee. I explained to her that her item had to be packed in store otherwise she would have already had it packed and ready for the label to go. She got pissed and really loud \"I PACKED IT IN THE STORE!\" \n\nI told her calmly that I could void it in my head I was like I don't get paid enough for this shit. I got my manager over to void it for her then she wanted to use two coupons. Those coupons got the transaction down to $0.00 and she was all cheesy and giddy apologizing to my manager and not to me. \n\nI was already mentally down with her and wanted her to leave. The rule is if you bring a unboxed package into the store you get charged a packing fee. Next time box your shit at home bitch. \n\nI am proud of myself for holding my tongue though because I recently lost my other job because another white woman pushed my buttons and she knew she was wrong. I swear white people never really grow the fuck up because that was a tantrum a child throws.\n\nSorry I just needed to let that out because damn. Maybe I should leave the packing fee out next time because that was embarrassing for me and I annoyed the rest of my shift.",

I wrote that story on the uniform with a marker and hung it up. I also collected a shirt from a guy from Trader Joe’s and a CNA from a nursing home.\nOne of the things I was trying to accomplish with the art project was just collecting the experiences of minorities working hourly-wage jobs and combatting any assumption upper management or white Americans make about us: “s/he’s uneducated.” “they’re stealing jobs.” Etc...\nSo I was wondering if anyone in this subreddit has any shirts and stories they’d be interested in sharing?

    "text": "Lost my job because I was targeted for being a white male I'm a 33 year old white male, and I am a mental health counsellor. I worked on a team with 4 other females, all counsellors/social workers/etc. On that team was a 23 year old who made her opinions about men very clear. Back in August she presented my manager with a list of things that I had said that offended her. I had no idea I was saying anything that offended her. There was about 6 things on this list, and many of them were just me expressing a different opinion than her. It was certainly never my intention to offend anyone with these opinions, and they weren't racist or sexist or derogatory. I've shown this list to many people, including many women, some of whom said they disagreed with some of my opinions, but none said they were worth complaining about. What's worse is this individual took the things I said, and twisted them, either misquoting them or taking them completely out of context, to make me look a certain way. I don't think she did this intentionally, I do believe this is what she heard me say as my words went through her filter. \n\nShe took it to the manager, who is a female and has also demonstrated having a negative bias towards men. For this reason, I was not offered the chance to tell my side of the story; I was ignored when pointing out that I didn't say these things the way she is saying I did. I was offended, and pointed out to my manager that other people on the team, including the woman who presented this list and my manager herself, have made comments that I could have complained about should I have wanted to. My manager has also commented on my appearance more than once, which is sexual harassment, and I reminded her of this (although I didn't put it that way). I stated that I felt this was incredibly hypocritical, but it didn't matter; I was sent to anti-racism anti-oppression training, one-on-one with a trainer chosen by my manager. I showed him the list, told him my side, and he said, in his professional opinion of doing this for 20+ years, that he felt I'm being singled out and I'm being sent to this training to be \"fixed\" so I'll go back to work, shut my mouth and be quiet. He believed this was a team issue being turned into a me issue, and I agreed. This was in September. In November we met with this trainer as a team. It was uncomfortable. I expressed my fear of sharing an opinion that someone disagrees with lest it be held against me at a later time. But we did the training, and things went back to normal. My working relationship with this young woman was never the same, but it was civil. \n\nFlash forward 3 months, when I am sitting in my office waiting for my first client of the day, and my manager and an hr rep entered my office and told me I am being let go because I \"don't fit in\" and that my \"views are better suited elsewhere.\" It was out of nowhere. I had been so careful with everything I had said since August. I received no warning, no investigation, no opportunity to fight for my job. It was decided.\n\nI have dedicated my life to helping others. I do not discriminate against anyone, quite the opposite in fact. I help individuals of all genders, sexual orientations, races, religions, ethnicities, ages and so on. I help many people who have been discriminated against, oppressed, or stigmatized. But I was on a team with a 23 year old female who only ever saw me as a white male, and she targeted me, and she was successful. She has had an impact on me financially, on my career, and a severe impact on my mental health. I hate her, and I hate my biased manager who handled the situation different than she would have if the roles were reversed. This is a scary time.\n\nEdit: I should have mentioned I consulted an employment lawyer. He is a friend of a friend, so I trust him and his advice. He said that although I likely have a case of discrimination, he strongly suggested I don't take legal action on the basis of discrimination, due to the fact that I am straight, white and male. He said that win or lose the case, it would reflect bad on me, particularly in the field that I work in.\n\nThe list:\n-age (she was the youngest on the team by 10 years. Myself, and the rest of the team, would occasionally playfully tease her about her age. I never once put her down because of it. At a team meeting she asked all of us to stop it, and I know I did. And yet, it still made the list) -he said that questions about power and privilege on interviews are useless (in fact, I said \"I didn't see the point\" but I was referring to one specific case, but that's a whole other story. But she generalized it, and that was not my intention or meaning nor my words) - mat leave (the women on the team were having a conversation about how the US was cutting parental leave time and were talking about how sexist it is. I said I don't think it's fair to call it sexist because, although it disproportionately affects women, it affects all genders who would take parental leave) -said he wanted another male on the team; \"there are too many of you and only one of me\" (at a team meeting we were talking about hiring a new person for the team, I suggested we consider hiring another male as some clients request male counsellors specifically and because I felt it might add some more diversity to the team. I was often shut down very quickly if the women on the team did not agree with my opinion. I certainly did not say the words she put in quotation marks) -you look nice (said to her ONE TIME in the year I worked with her before she gave this list, because she got dressed up for a presentation and I was just trying to be nice. I didn't think anything of it. I certainly wasn't hitting on her or flirting with her, and again, it was a one time occurence)\n-he is aggressive when his point is not agreed with and does not take into account other people's feelings (in fact, I would often be shown aggression from the females on my team. When I suggested hiring another male, the 23 year old snapped at me \"you can't say that!!\" and she clearly did not take into account my feelings. But of course that doesn't go both ways)",

    "text": "A compilation of evidence debunking feminist historical revisionism. I have made a post somewhat similar to this before but I've since collected a lot more information about these topics and so I believe warrants yet another post.\n\n*Myth #1: Women weren't allowed to work.*\n\nMost documentation from the past heavily implies that people attempted to avoid working as much as possible. Even so, many women did work (mostly because they had no choice but to) and there has never been a law restricting women from working.\n\n\"Though creative research has produced evidence of women working at male-dominated occupations in the eighteenth century and before, there is undoubtedly more documentation out there, in newspapers, diaries, legal proceedings, and prints. What is more compelling is the lack of documentation that women were not allowed to work. Although religious practices and social norms might have restricted certain activities in some parts of the world, there were no laws prohibiting women from working a trade.\"\n\nAt the time, only members of a trade guild (associations of producers that trained craft people, maintained control over production, regulated competition and prices) were allowed to sell their goods or practice their skill within the city. Non-guild members were prohibited from selling competitive products. An aspiring master would have to pass through the career chain from apprentice to journeyman before they could be elected to become a master tradesman. They would then have to produce a sum of money and a masterpiece before they could actually join the guild. If the masterpiece was not accepted by the masters, they were not allowed to join the guild, possibly remaining a journeyman for the rest of their life.\n\nWomen were not barred from any of the trade guilds in Britain at least as far back as the 1400s. Apprentice forms for guildwork had spaces left blank to insert 'he' or 'she', though girls who chose this traditional route to mastery of a trade (which was extremely long and arduous) were usually orphaned and had low prospects for marriage, thus they were going to need to work.\n\nMarried women, though, had the privilege of circumventing the long, onerous, arduous process of trade certification as they could receive the master tradesman status from their husbands and thereby continue his work, even take on apprentices to train (which suggests that the social assumption was that wives would learn enough about their husband's business and trade to be able to at least continue to oversee it after he died). Lots of widows continued to run their husbands' businesses long after their death.\n\nThe Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths in London lists sixty-five \"brethren\" and two \"sistren\" in its 1434 charter.\n\nA 1770 publication called *The Tradesman's True Guide or a Universal Directory for the Towns of Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Walsal, Dudley and the manufacturing village in the neighborhood of Birmingham* carried exhaustive lists of tradesmen and tradeswomen alphabetically by name and by trade, and there are women listed in every trade from butcher to wire drawer.\n\n[https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring04/women.cfm](https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring04/women.cfm)\n\nReally, very little I've seen shows that women were maliciously \"kept out\" from trades or professions that they wanted to enter into. It may have been a social norm that most women did not seek out careers as they do now, but looking at the histories of the first women to enter into medicine, law, etc, show that they hardly faced any resistance in doing so.\n\nIn 1847, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman to attend medical school in the US and was the first woman on the Medical Register of the General Medical Council. She sent applications for admission to twelve of the most promising institutions in the northern states, and her application was accepted by the medical department of Geneva University. Feminist revisionist history \"explains\" that she was only admitted to the college by the evil men as a joke, but as will be amply demonstrated this is the opposite of what actually happened.\n\nIn fact, the student body sent her a letter to welcome her:\n\n>At a meeting of the entire medical class of Geneva Medical College, held this day, October 20, 1847, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:–  \n>  \n>Resolved – That one of the radical principles of a Republican Government is the universal education of both sexes; that to every branch of scientific education the door should be open equally to all; that the application of Elizabeth Blackwell to become a member of our class meets our entire approbation; and in extending our unanimous invitation we pledge ourselves that no conduct of ours shall cause her to regret her attendance at this institution.  \n>  \n>2. Resolved – That a copy of these proceedings be signed by the chairman and transmitted to Elizabeth Blackwell.\n\nShe describes this letter as one of her most valued possessions, and in her autobiography she states that the men of the college supported her 100% and beyond.\n\n\"The behaviour of the medical class during the two years that I was with them was admirable. It was that of true Christian gentlemen. I learned later that some of them had been inclined to think my application for admission a hoax, perpetrated at their expense by a rival college. But when the *bona-fide* student actually appeared they gave her a manly welcome, and fulfilled to the letter the promise contained in their invitation.\"\n\nShe also notes that the general public also had a favourable view of a woman entering into medicine.\n\n\"The admission of a woman for the first time to a complete medical education and full equality in the privileges and the responsibilities of the profession produced a widespread effect in America. The public press very generally recorded the event, and expressed a favourable opinion of it. Even in Europe some notice of it was taken, and 'Punch' showed his cordial appreciation by his amusing but friendly verses.\"\n\n[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/blackwell/pioneer/pioneer.html?fbclid=IwAR09FZZlnVMVha0PNLYnQQDSnptVDEoGxokEf10QHPCGgxZMly5HyfDlgQI#III](http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/blackwell/pioneer/pioneer.html?fbclid=IwAR09FZZlnVMVha0PNLYnQQDSnptVDEoGxokEf10QHPCGgxZMly5HyfDlgQI#III)\n\nThere are also other examples of women entering into \"male\" fields and encountering little resistance. There's the example of Arabella Mansfield, the first female lawyer in the United States. Although by Iowa law the bar exam was restricted to \"males over 21,\" Arabella Mansfield took the exam in 1869, passing it with high scores. Mansfield challenged the state law excluding her, and the Court ruled that women may not be denied the right to practice law in Iowa, admitting Mansfield to the bar.\n\nOr Ada Lovelace, who was encouraged in her mathematical ability from a young age by her parents and received the best of tutors to increase her ability. She worked with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Machine, though they both \"fell into historical obscurity, and the Analytical Engine was unknown to builders of electro-mechanical and electronic computing machines in the 1930s and 1940s when they began their work, resulting in the need to re-invent many of the architectural innovations Babbage had proposed.\"\n\nOr Amelia Earhart, who was flown \"like a sack of potatoes\" by pilot Wilmer Stultz across the Atlantic in her 1928 transatlantic flight, and immediately became a celebrity, wrote a book about the experience, was used to endorse products, and dubbed 'Lady Lindy'. There is a plaque that marks where the plane landed in Wales. All the fervour over it was solely because she was a woman who crossed the Atlantic regardless of the fact that she didn't do any flying at all in her 1928 flight (She did, however, go on to complete a transatlantic solo flight later on in 1932).\n\n[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia\\_Earhart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Earhart)\n\nOr, for a very long-ago example of this, Murasaki Shikibu from Japan around the year 1000, who listened at the door while her brother received lessons in Chinese writing and through that learned it herself. She was far from reviled for being a woman who knew Chinese and was commissioned by the Empress to write the Tale of Genji, a classic work of Japanese literature often called the world's first novel.\n\nOh, the o p p r e s s i o n .\n\n*Myth #2: Marriage was an institution created by men to oppress women. Men were disproportionately given privilege and power and women were treated like his property in marriage.*\n\nAgain this is a bastardisation of the past. Feminism has to stop treating men as the enemy and as the source of all women's (and also men's) problems. They need to realise that things weren't always as they are now, and realise that it was not Patriarchy or men that restricted the choices of both genders and forced them into strictly defined roles, but that these roles came about because it was the best way of arranging societies in the past - a past that was much harsher and more unforgiving than it is now. A past in which there was more work to do than there were hours in a day. A past where men spent most of their short lives working like mules to support themselves and their families and women spent most of their short lives incapacitated by childbirth and child-rearing. A past in which we sent children into coal mines that ruined their lungs and into factories which lost them limbs. Things sucked, and the reason it was bearable at all back then was *because* of the gender roles.\n\nMen were not the ones who relegated women to the domestic sphere or kept them dependent on men. Biology did. A woman at that time could not simply strike out on her own and do whatever she wanted. For most of history we had no reliable birth control, no safe abortion, no maternity leave, or social security, and most public sphere work back then involved hard labour. And if you were a woman back then who wanted to be able to have sex, then you would have had to plan your life around the idea that you would be getting pregnant, giving birth, and breastfeeding for most of your adult life - and that would have meant you could not be a reliable enough worker to support even yourself, let alone a child, and it would inherently have made you dependent on other people to help you. Until the last 100 years or so, most women could not have lived a life of children and public sphere work, independent of a man (and not all can today, realistically).\n\nEven with support, most women in poor and middle class families had to work because that was the only way to make enough money to live.\n\nSo in a time when single motherhood was a one-way trip to the gutter, marriage was a practical arrangement. The function of marriage was not to oppress women, but to positively assign paternity inasmuch as possible, and then obligate the men so assigned to their children and the mothers of their children. For life.\n\nThe taboo on sex outside of marriage (which was applied to men no less than women) made it difficult for an unscrupulous man to cheat the system. These rules surrounding marriage also mitigated the problem of paternity uncertainty, which maximised men's willingness to invest in their kids. \"I know these are my kids, so I will work hard to feed and shelter them.\" And the reason why we kept lifelong monogamous marriage for so long is because it increased the resources which would have been available to offspring, providing a healthier environment for children to grow up in.\n\nSo when a man married a woman, he was legally obligated to feed, clothe and shelter her and any children produced in the marriage to the best of his ability. Unlike what feminists seem to think, he could not sell her. He could not return her for his money back. He could not drop her at the local midden heap. He could not destroy her the way he could his actual chattels. He could not trade her for a better one. He could not legally neglect her.\n\nJust to make things crystal clear, here is a summary list of entitlements that women enjoyed in marriage (and after marriage) during the old \"patriarchal\" system of the past.\n\n1. When a woman married, she had to hand over her property to her husband's care (again, NOT because she herself was property, but because he was administrator of the family), but he OWED her not just a living, but the best living he was financially capable of providing for her. A wife was entitled to be maintained by her husband.\n2. Though women did not have the right to enter into contracts in their own name in marriage, women had the privilege of the Law of Agency, giving them the legal right to purchase goods on their husbands' credit as their agent. If the wife racked up debts that the husband couldn't pay, she was immune from liability for the debts she racked up - that liability fell to the husband instead.\n3. Women had the entitlement of being protected from prosecution for any number of crimes if they could prove their husbands were aware of said crimes. In which case, he would be prosecuted in her stead--not just held AS responsible as she was, but held solely responsible for her actions. This allowed married women to displace accountability for a large number of offences onto their husbands. \"She's out of control and does what she wants, regardless of my wishes,\" was not a valid legal defence for those men.\n4. Women were exempt from paying taxes, and there was an entire female underground economy of barter and trade that was not subject to taxation or government interference. Even when married women gained the right to hold property within marriage, it was their husbands who were responsible for the taxes owing on it, and it was their husbands who were held 100% financially liable for providing all necessaries to the family, including the wife, even if she made more money than he did.\n5. After divorce, men were held fully financially responsible under the law for the ex-wife and kids. Divorced women were entitled to be supported by their ex-husbands to a level commensurate with the husband's for potentially the rest of their lives unless she remarried.\n\n[https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download\\_file?file\\_format=application/pdf&safe\\_filename=Item.pdf&type\\_of\\_work=Journal%20article](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download_file?file_format=application/pdf&safe_filename=Item.pdf&type_of_work=Journal%20article)\n\nThat doesn't sound at all like women were treated like property to me.\n\nI'm sorry, but if I have property, I have no legal duty of care toward the actual property I own, nor any obligation to commit to own it until death. I can smash my property on the ground and treat it however I want and it would be my right to do so. Men could not do any of that to the women they were married to. They had obligations towards them to provide for them - even after divorce, and to protect them - even from the consequences of their own actions. Wives had no such obligation towards their husbands - they were entitled to be the ones who were supported. Because the purpose of marriage in the past was not to oppress women and make them the property of men, but to ensure that women and their children could be provided for and protected, and to place the responsibility for that provision and protection on the man even at cost to his own wellbeing, health, and even life. This has been the case since time immemorial.\n\n\"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.\"\n\nEphesians 5.\n\n[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A22-33&version=NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A22-33&version=NIV)\n\nIn fact, many of the supposed \"privileges\" men had in marriage in the past were to help them carry out their obligations and to prevent them from becoming wholly onerous.\n\nIf a man had an obligation to be accountable for provision for his wife and children and to maintain family finances, it stood to reason that he also should have the entitlement of having control over any assets of his marriage, including those his wife brought into the marriage, because he was the one who had a responsibility to keep the entire family afloat and to increase their holdings.\n\nIf a man was responsible for the protection of his wife and children to the point where he could be legally required to stand between his wife and the law within numerous contexts, and be punished in her stead (whether she contracted debts he couldn't pay or committed a crime he would have to answer for), it makes sense why he would be considered head of household and why his family would need to obey him as well as abide by the restrictions he placed on them.\n\nIf, upon divorce, a man would be held solely responsible for the maintenance of his wife and child, it makes sense why he would get custody of the child that he was supporting, as well as ownership of assets so he could satisfy that obligation.\n\nWe gave men these rights and privileges because they were the tools that he needed to satisfy his responsibilities. And in that way there was a balance. \"Women \"got less\" because their obligations and accountability were less, their responsibility was less. Men \"got more\" because the buck stopped with them, whether that buck consisted of a sack of coins or his blood.\"\n\n*Myth #3: Men were allowed to beat their wives with impunity.*\n\nIn the past men were allowed to use \"mild correction\" on their wives under the law (as he was socially and legally responsible for the actions of his wife to the extent that he could even be held accountable for the crimes and offences she committed), but he could not beat her black and blue. Men had restrictions on what corporal punishment they could use on their wives.\n\nIn Colonial America, when men went beyond what was legally acceptable, they received punishment through the pillory. “The pillory was employed for treason, sedition, arson, blasphemy, witchcraft, perjury, wife beating, cheating, forgery, coin clipping, dice cogging, slandering, conjuring, fortune-telling, and drunkenness, among other offences. On several occasions, onlookers pelted the pilloried prisoner so enthusiastically with heavy missiles that death resulted.”\n\n[https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring03/branks.cfm](https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring03/branks.cfm)\n\nThe whipping post also was a favourite form of punishment for wife-beating. Many examples of vigilante justice, sometimes lethal, enacted against wifebeaters can be found in newspaper clippings from the 1800s and onward, with the full endorsement of society.\n\n[https://unapologeticallyantifeminist.video.blog/2019/05/21/correcting-notions-about-domestic-violence-in-history/](https://unapologeticallyantifeminist.video.blog/2019/05/21/correcting-notions-about-domestic-violence-in-history/)\n\nWe can assume that this was practiced in Europe as well. Likewise, Americans practiced shivaree and Europeans practiced charivari as a way to enable social censure of wife-beaters. Charivari was a historical folk custom expressing public disapproval of personal behaviour, where a mock parade was staged through a community accompanied by a discordant mock serenade. Sometimes the crowd would carry an effigy of the targeted man to a substitute punishment, e.g. burning. Sometimes the man who physically abused his wife would be abused by the community.\n\nThey would chant:\n\n*Old Abram Higback has been paying his good woman; But he neither paid her for what or for why, But he up with his fist and blacked her eye.*\n\n*Now all ye old women, and old women kind, Get together, and be in a mind; Collar him, and take him to the shit-house, And shove him over head.*\n\n*Now if that does not mend his manners, The skin of his arse must go to the tanners; And if that does not mend his manners, Take him and hang him on a nail in Hell.*\n\n*And if the nail happens to crack, Down with your flaps, and at him piss.*\n\nHowever, if a husband was beaten by his wife - the husband, in contrast, was also the subject of the charivari for essentially allowing it to happen. In France about 1400, husbands beaten by their wives were “paraded on an ass, face to tail.”  In England, a [mural in Montacute House](https://montacutehouse.blogspot.com/2012/04/skimmington-ride.html) (constructed about 1598) shows a wife beating her husband with a shoe and then a crowd parading the husband on a [cowlstaff](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cowlstaff). \n\nSamuel Pepys recorded in his diary, 10 June 1667: “in the afternoon took boat and down to Greenwich, where I find the stairs full of people, there being a great riding there to-day for a man, the constable of the town, whose wife beat him.”\n\nA Frenchman who traveled in England reported in 1698: \"I have sometimes met in the streets of London a woman carrying a figure of straw representing a man, crown’d with very ample horns, preceded by a drum, and followed by a mob, making a most grating noise with tongs, grid-irons, frying-pans, and sauce-pans. I asked what was the meaning of all this; they told me that a woman had given her husband a sound beating, for accusing her of making him a cuckold, and that upon such occasions some kind neighbour of the poor innocent injur’d creature generally performed this ceremony.\"\n\n[https://www.purplemotes.net/2013/01/27/charivari-sex-inequality/](https://www.purplemotes.net/2013/01/27/charivari-sex-inequality/)\n\nHmmm. So while a man could give his wife mild correction under the law, if he went too far with wife-beating the community would frown down upon him and punish him with the pillory, whippings and charivari. THERE WAS NO SUCH EXTREME SOCIAL OR LEGAL CENSURE FOR A WIFE WHO BEAT HER HUSBAND. IF SHE BEAT HIM, HE WAS THE ONE WHO WAS PUNISHED.\n\n*Myth #4: Husbands were owed sex with their wives. Marital rape was not illegal, and marriage as an institution was based around rape of women.*\n\nThe idea at the time was that there could not be such a thing as marital rape because as a married person you are owed sex from your spouse, i.e. conjugal rights. This applied to both men and women. People who believe that conjugal rights \"allowed husbands to rape wives\" and not the other way around haven't actually done any research.\n\nIt was based on the idea that **both parties** had a right to sex in the relationship, and this was exercisable in law by each partner in a marriage.\n\nThe Bible said:\n\n\"*It is* good for a man not to touch a woman. **2** Nevertheless, because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. **3** Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband. **4** The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband *does.* And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife *does.* **5** Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.\"\n\n[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7&version=NKJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7&version=NKJV)\n\nDo note the specific passage where it says \"The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband *does.* And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife *does.\"*\n\nAnd here's a quote from an article detailing the history of sex and marriage.\n\n\"A hundred years ago or so, if you took the statute books literally, the only people entitled to have sex with each other were people who were legally married. All other sex was against the law. Fornication (sex with unmarried people) was illegal; so was adultery (sex with a married person—but not the person you yourself were married to). Cohabitation—living with someone in a sexual relationship—was against the law, except for people who were legally married. Enforcement was, shall we say, something less than perfect. At times, it was almost nonexistent. And the rules were riddled with exceptions. Sodomy, on the other hand, was quite a serious crime; and the full weight of the law sometimes came down heavily on people who had gay or lesbian sex.\"\n\n\"Married people were not only *entitled* to have sex; they were, in a way, *required* to have sex. Of course, nobody checked on whether John and Mary were having sex every night, or once a week, or once a month, or never. But if either John or Mary did not perform at all, for whatever reason, the frustrated partner had grounds for divorce; or even perhaps an annulment.\n\n[https://verdict.justia.com/2017/01/24/sex-necessary-legally-speaking](https://verdict.justia.com/2017/01/24/sex-necessary-legally-speaking)\n\nHusbands faced divorce if they were impotent and unable to consummate the marriage, though charges were usually made years after the wedding day. There was a similar charge of frigidity for wives, but it seems that wives charging their husbands for impotency was far more common. Husbands had to show an erection to a court audience and sometimes attempt to perform sex with their wives as well.\n\n[Source 1](http://www.bu.edu/law/journals-archive/bulr/volume89n5/documents/HOFFMAN.pdf) [Source 2](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/05/18/the-hard-on-on-trial/)\n\nBeing incapable of performing sex for your wife could merit corporal punishment. One medieval husband wrote about his unhappy marriage and his impotence in a book called The Lamentations of Little Matheus.\n\n\"My wife wants it, but I can’t. She petitions for her right. I say no. I just can’t pay.\"\n\n\"Even given his sexual incapacity, Matheolus was subject to corporal punishment:\n\n\"Acting as her own advocate, Petra {Matheolus’s wife} puts forward the law that if a shriveled purse {scrotum} can’t pay because it’s empty, under statute recompense for that injury is corporal punishment.\"\n\n[https://www.purplemotes.net/2015/05/03/matheolus-church-wife/](https://www.purplemotes.net/2015/05/03/matheolus-church-wife/)\n\nSo what does this show? It shows that both parties had an obligation to provide the other partner with sex during the marriage, and could not deprive their spouse of it. If it was an issue, it was not an issue that solely affected women.\n\n*Myth #5: \"Men had the vote and women did not. Women's suffrage was a matter of women as a united group fighting for their rights against the evil men that kept it from them. Suffragettes were champions of equality who got women the vote. Etc, etc.\"*\n\nReally, I'm very tired of hearing this one.\n\nIn Britain, the right to vote was not only restricted by gender, but also by class. Property owners had the vote, the vast majority of men did not. In 1830, just 3% of the population had the right to vote.\n\nDuring this time, there were a few groups who were fighting for the vote to be extended to them, and one of these groups were the Chartists, who were active from 1830 to 1868. They were fighting for broad electoral reforms including:\n\n* a vote for all men (over 21)\n* the secret ballot\n* no property qualification to become an MP\n* payment for MPs\n* electoral districts of equal size\n* annual elections for Parliament.\n\nThey presented three huge demonstrations to Parliament, and their requests were denied every time. The restrictions were relaxed but not abolished. Benjamin Disraeli said when introducing the Second Reform Act of 1867: \"We do not live – and I trust it will never be the fate of this country to live – under a democracy. The propositions which I am going to make tonight certainly have no tendency in that direction.\"\n\nThere were also the suffragists and the suffragettes, who were fighting for the vote to be extended to women. Suffragists emerged in the mid-19th century and believed in peaceful, constitutional campaign methods. In the early 20th century, after the suffragists failed to make significant progress, a new generation of activists emerged. These women became known as the suffragettes, and they were willing to take direct, militant action for the cause.\n\nHowever, a huge amount of women disagreed with women's suffrage. So many women objected to the franchise being imposed on them that in the mere 18 months leading up to a 1910 parliamentary debate on women's suffrage, anti-suffragettes had managed to collect 300,000 signatures from women who objected to the franchise being imposed on them. Meanwhile, in the 16 years leading up to that debate, suffragettes only managed to collect 193,000 signatures of women who wanted the vote.\n\nA segment from the transcript of the debate:\n\n\"Still, for what it is worth, one finds that from 1890–1906 only 193,000 women signed Petitions to this House in favour of female suffrage, and that during the last eighteen months, a period in which a strong anti-suffrage association has been in existence, 300,000 women, some of them eminent women, have signed petitions against it, and to the effect that these proposals shall not be forced upon them.\"\n\nAnd...\n\n\"A rather interesting illustration was furnished by an inquiry which was instituted by \"The Sheffield Independent,\" a newspaper which I think itself is sympathetic with these proposals. This inquiry was addressed to the women householders of Sheffield. Twenty-three thousand papers were sent out, and of the replies 9,000 were in favour of woman suffrage and 14,000 were against it. The representatives of this paper reported that in many cases their emissaries were chased with violence from the houses by the female inhabitants under the impression that they were collecting statistical matter as the emissaries of the suffragist party.\"\n\nIt may be difficult to understand why so many women would reject the vote so vehemently, but this was an era where full citizenship rights like the right to vote were granted only to those with citizenship responsibilities like conscription (and sometimes not even then). In that historical context, the vote was actually viewed not just as a right, but also an obligation. So it was never really about men in power shutting women out of the franchise. It was about government having to decide whether to impose a responsibility on women that women as a whole *clearly did not want.*\n\n[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1910/jul/11/parliamentary-franchise-women-bill](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1910/jul/11/parliamentary-franchise-women-bill)\n\nRegardless of the lack of support for women's suffrage among women, suffragettes became extremely militant in their activism. In 1903 Emmeline Pankhurst founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) with her daughters Christabel and Sylvia, and the WSPU carried out a nationwide bombing and arson campaign. Between 1912 and 1915, hundreds of bombs were left on trains, in theatres, post offices, churches, even outside the Bank of England; while arson attacks on timber yards, railway stations and private houses inflicted an untold amount of damage.\n\n[https://www.historytoday.com/history-matters/sanitising-suffragettes](https://www.historytoday.com/history-matters/sanitising-suffragettes)\n\nInstead of being beneficial in supporting the vote for women, it was disastrous. Lloyd George said: \"The action of the militants is ruinous. The feeling amongst the sympathisers of the cause in the House is one of panic. I am frankly not very hopeful of success if these tactics are persisted in.\"\n\nTerrorism aside, Emmeline Pankhurst was also resistant to acquiring the vote for working class men, realising that this would be much tougher than winning the vote for \"respectable\" AKA upper-class women, and underlying the resistance appears to have been her contempt for working-class men. According to Sean Lang in his book on Parliamentary reform: \"The Pankhursts became stridently anti-male, ruthlessly dropping even the most loyal of their male supporters from the WSPU, and claiming, as Christabel did in her 1913 book *The Great Scourge*, that men were “little more than carriers of venereal disease”.\"\n\n[https://conservativewoman.co.uk/men-won-votes-women-not-suffragettes/](https://conservativewoman.co.uk/men-won-votes-women-not-suffragettes/)\n\nWhen WW1 came around in 1914, suffragettes also threw their support behind the White Feather campaign with the aim of shaming men into enlisting. Those young women went in for the kill, striking men at the very heart of their masculine identities, the bestowing of a feather telling them, \"If you don't go off to be maimed or die, you are no longer a man in the eyes of some brassy chit you've never even met before and will probably never see again.\" And many men went, because a woman's censure - ANY woman's censure - had the power to drive them straight into the teeth of death.\n\nBy mid 1915, it was clear that not enough men were signing up to replace the fatalities on the front line, and the Military Service Act was introduced in January 1916. By March 1916 compulsory conscription for all single men aged 18-41 was in place. In May 1916, the Act was extended to include conscription for married men.\n\n[http://www.eastsussexww1.org.uk/attitudes-towards-conscription/index.html](http://www.eastsussexww1.org.uk/attitudes-towards-conscription/index.html)\n\nIt was only at that point that the British government considered extending the vote to all men, as most of the propertyless, working class men that were conscripted into war during WW1 did not have the right to vote, and this was finally starting to be seen as the injustice that it was. In the trenches class divisions were eroded to the extent that class no longer had any real meaning and every man was the equal of each other in terms of sacrifice and service to one's country.\n\nMen got universal suffrage in 1918 with the Representation of the People Act, which enfranchised more than five million men over the age of 21 without regard to property or class. Women of all classes were piggybacked onto the Act, with an age restriction temporarily in place to prevent women from becoming a supermajority voting bloc, given that about 1 million British men had died in the war. Regardless, this brought more than eight million women over 30 into the electorate. And just ten years later, the 1928 Act (the act which gave women electoral equality) gave the vote to women at age 21, which added another five million women to the electorate.\n\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/has-everyone-forgotten-male-suffrage/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/has-everyone-forgotten-male-suffrage/)\n\nIntroducing the 1918 Bill, the Home Secretary George Cave said: \"War by all classes of our countrymen has brought us nearer together, has opened men's eyes, and removed misunderstandings on all sides. It has made it, I think, impossible that ever again, at all events in the lifetime of the present generation, there should be a revival of the old class feeling which was responsible for so much, and, among other things, for the exclusion for a period, of so many of our population from the class of electors. I think I need say no more to justify this extension of the franchise.\"\n\nThe Act was achieved not by the suffragettes’ terrorist tactics, but by fighting of men in WW1, when thousands of men from their many different backgrounds came together to fight the common enemy. This finally achieved what the Chartists, the Levellers and the peasants before them had struggled for in terms of eroding barriers of class. Without the sacrifice of men who endured the horror of trench warfare in WW1, class barriers would have persisted and at most the vote would have been extended only to elite, wealthy, propertied women.\n\nIn a later study of attitudes to conscription in 1939, one woman responded: \"In the last war \\[(WW1)\\] I never told one man that he ought to go. I tried to put myself in their place. If I’d been them I wouldn’t have gone. When I saw them going through the streets – all the young men – I used to think that they were being driven like cattle to the slaughter house. And they were, weren’t they? Fodder for the guns.\"\n\nThe common idea that all men had the vote, and that women did not, and that women's suffrage was a fight of women who were united against men working as an oppressive force to keep them down is an affront to these men who died in a literal war that secured universal suffrage for everyone (many of which, in fact, did not have the vote). It also ignores and erases the will and sentiment of many, many, *many* anti-suffragette women who actively rejected the vote and protested vehemently against it being imposed on them.\n\nFurthermore, the view that suffragettes were a valiant, fair-minded, equality-oriented group who got women the vote and whose activism merely amounted to firecrackers in barrels is an affront to any right-thinking person. The real violence and extremism of the suffragettes is barely, if at all, recognised by the general public, and this is partly due to attempts by suffragettes to sanitise their history.\n\n\"Laura E. Nym Mayhall, in her work on the militant suffrage movement, identified the importance of \"a small group of former suffragettes\" in the 1920s and 1930s, who created a highly stylised story of the WSPU and the history of suffrage in England, which emphasised \"women’s martyrdom and passivity\". The group set about compiling the documents, memoirs and memorabilia that now form the basis of the Suffragette Fellowship Collection held by the Museum of London.\"\n\n[https://www.historytoday.com/history-matters/sanitising-suffragettes](https://www.historytoday.com/history-matters/sanitising-suffragettes)\n\nAnd here we are now, in crazy world. According to the dominant narrative, all men always had the vote since the dawn of recorded human history, and they refused to give it to women because penis. The demonstrations of the Chartists, and the dead bodies of these men that were sacrificed to the unpopular idea of male suffrage (and who got votes for women in the process), have gone down the memory hole. The terroristic actions of the suffragettes, engaged in for the benefit of wealthy and privileged women only and for which they were barely punished, are the noblest of acts for the noblest of causes. And of course, the only reason anyone could EVER have opposed them was because of misogyny.\n\nedit: wording\n\nedit 2: Added some extracts from [w1g2's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/edyrf5/a_compilation_of_evidence_debunking_feminist/fbtays6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).",

    "text": "Feminism: Enabling Female Psychopaths Men and women, and gender fluid, nonbinary, persons of colour, LGBTIQ+ persons, (and definitely not privileged white men), we got a lot right in the Western world since World War 2. Two things amaze me about the organization of Western society. One, society has so effectively removed the opportunities for the psychopathic individuals to thrive with one exception. Two, that one exception is feminist psychopathy directed to men.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTeachers can't smack, gropers get caught on camera and imprisoned, there's enough prosperity that generally people have an option other than staying when their romantic partner is abusive, workplace bullying no longer flies like it used to, by and large violence between men is far less tolerated, child abuse is not kept silent about but every effort is expended in its prevention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn other words, the many 'hunting grounds' the psychopath might have previously used to express his or her disregard for the rights of others have been closed off or at least curtailed severely. However, all is not lost for the psychopath, because a new hunting ground has been opened with a numerous prey, and all one needs to be given an open season ticket to hunt is a vagina. (No, sorry MTFs, I doubt a surgically constructed one would give you full hunting rights, but you could always try).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe major thing I have noticed in the course of my life is the manner in which feminism has given massive cover for antisocial and psychopathic women to harm men. It's the only context that I'm aware of in Western societies where this 'privilege' exists. Try treating blacks, Asians, Hispanics, spastics, the blind, homosexuals, Muslims or Parsis like this, and you'll lose your job quicker than you can say, 'our company doesn't stand for discrimination'. But treat a man this way, go right ahead! Because if you are a psychopathic woman mistreating a man YOU WILL NOT FACE SOCIETY'S USUAL CENSURE AND CONDEMNATION OF SUCH BEHAVIOUR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have experienced this myself, from quite an early age in fact, although generally speaking I believe I have avoided the harsher edge of this reality. Employment is the obvious context this comes to mind - a female boss or even colleague can make hell for a male subordinate, she's got cover. If the guy were to do a tenth of that to a woman, he'd be up before HR with, 'do it again and you're out', warning at the very least. I don't know how it is in America, but in Australia my understanding is female managers are brought in directly so they can work on firing a sufficiently difficult female staff member - the male managers are scared of doing it, so will often be swapped out for the termination process. I've mostly had very good female bosses, but the behavior of some women colleagues I've dealt with (and yes, they were disproportionately lesbian) clearly indicated that they had cover AND THEY KNEW THEY HAD COVER.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the problem, women in Western society know they've got cover when they have a dispute or conflict with a man. This kind of imbalance is always a problem, it's destabilizing, but that's not what I'm talking about here, the everyday woman getting her way because she knows she can. I'm talking about the genuinely antisocial and psychopathic woman, the woman who has a genuine contempt for humanity. This is a very small subset of the human population, but they cause enormous havoc and harm. We cannot do anything, as a society, to stop a certain number of psychopaths growing to maturity every year, they are an indelible part of the tapestry of human existence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut while in the past we've often allowed them to predate because of indifference - who cares about the poor? - or fear - I'd better not criticize Stalin. I cannot think of a time, before the current state of affairs emerged somewhere in the 1990s as far as I can tell, where we have without a violent change of government given them complete cover for their actions, and in fact supported them in the very process of their psychopathic abuse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I was young in the early 1990s my older sibling, who was sometimes violent, poured boiling coffee on my back. I had to get burns treatment at the local hospital, and the young male doctor there asked me if my father had done it. No, I said, my sibling did it. He asked the question, while he treated me, about three additional times. A more suggestible kid could easily have given the answer he was so clearly fishing for. I remember years later, a fully fledge adult, I talked to a therapist. He wanted to know all about how abusive and violent my father was (somewhat abusive, virtually never violent). He sympathized, he understood. But he didn't want to hear me say anything negative about my mother, who I certainly believe had psychopathic tendencies and who has wrought mental destruction on my siblings, particularly my younger sister. At the time it didn't register, but later I started thinking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was watching a YouTube video that discussed the fact that men's rights groups were banned as student clubs on Canadian campuses. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s4sZi8zjzY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s4sZi8zjzY) here's the link. A woman and man who appeared to be from ethnic minority backgrounds argued up hill and down dale why such groups were an evil fifth column that should be banned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe woman, who appeared to be Indian Canadian, even suggested men's groups might be more acceptable if they talked about 'the real issues', such as the plight of 'men of color' and 'transgender men', and she intimated that her white fellow panelist, supportive of freedom of speech, should zip it, and, all class, she seemed to mock him being of an older generation. She and the other man who spoke in her support against men's rights - who also appeared to belong to an ethnic minority, but seemed to be motivated more by sureing up his liberal credentials for political reasons than psychopathy - hinted that 'straight white men' should put up and shut up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen there are the news reports Canada will give 95% of its foreign aid for women and girls. Well, that's nice...if you're a psychopath, and somehow find boys dying of HIV in Africa okay while girls dying of HIV in Africa not okay. Anyone who has lived in a developing country knows this is what it means, it's not some theoretical institute that spouts hatred we're talking about, it's for the basics - and the Canadian government has literally said girls' lives matter, little boys' lives don't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've heard female family court judges expressly say they love the job because they can use it to deny custody to fathers. It's not so much the fact women are helped when men aren't that disturbs me - sure, it's unfair that men don't get special teaching places reserved for them to balance the gender numbers, but women get engineering places because WE MUST have gender balanced numbers there. But what I'm talking about is seeing the malice of genuinely psychopathic women given extraordinary rein to harm and injure men, and inevitably, their girlfriends and wives and children. I have seen time and again so many feminists truly motivated more by a desire to hurt men than help women. Brett Kavanaugh, an innocent man with wife and daughters - fuck it, hurting him with disproven falsehoods is more important than considering the welfare impact of this on his wife and daughters. It is more important to hurt a man than help a woman, which would make sense to the psychopath, right, because the psychopath disregards everyone except themselves including women. It's just that the direct harm is allowed to be delivered to the man, and all well and good if the indirect harm then flows to the women in that man's life. What isn't allowed, under feminisms perverted rules, is for the harm to be directed DIRECTLY to another woman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt reminded me of what Cassie Jaye said in an interview, if I'm paraphrasing right, feminism isn't about helping women, it's about helping feminism. I'd go a step further, feminism isn't about helping women, it's about hurting men directly even if this indirectly hurts the women connected to men.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will be blunt. The majority of the most extremely hateful behavior I've seen has been from women who either openly self-identify as, or who the inferential evidence indicates are, lesbian. I've seen it from both straight and lesbian women, but I would say most of the most extreme psychopathic and antisocial behavior I have seen by women against men has been from lesbian women. I am not saying lesbian women have a greater incidence of psychopathy, I do not know if there is - or whether there would even be allowed to take place - research into this. But this is what I have seen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to leave everyone on a negative note. So I'd just like to add that this problem has gotten consistently worse over the last 20 years I have observed it and every indication is it is going to continue to get worse. There appears to be no catalyst or force to change this, and so, I would expect, an increase in psychopathic and antisocial behavior in society by a small minority of women against a lot of men.",

Last night I was working the cash register when this heavy black lady came up (race plays a small role so that's for description) and I rang her up. Supposedly before I started another guy used to work and she used to flirt with him. My manager was there and explained he got fired for something. The customer then said, \"oh that's too bad. Well at least I have a new fat white boy to mess with\". \n\nMore context, I'm not very comfortable with being called fat. And it's not for the obvious reason. It's because the last time someone called me fat he pulled a gun on me in a robbery attempt.  \n\nSo my face was supposedly frozen. My manager laughed to try to defuse the situation but the customer then said, \"oh, I mean nice plump boy\" then fucking reached over the register and grabbed my chest (I'm big mind you so I do have man boobs) and started squeezing them. \n\nI was very uncomfortable and upset. My manager just laughed at the whole situation as did some of the other customers.  I can't lose this job but I do feel kinda upset to be honest.

    "text": "International Women are Good Men Are Bad Day Hi ladies and  gents, if you live in the northern hemisphere you're probably still 'enjoying' the celebrations for International Women's Day. Now if this day was a celebration of women, motherhood, women's achievements, et cetera, I'd be enjoying it too, and have a glass of sparkling grape juice and a piece of cake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut as a bigger, older school bully might say to you when you explain to her you need your lunch money, 'that's not how it works!'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's easy for men to celebrate women's achievements, and vice-versa, and at a superficial level that's not a zero sum game. However, when the tire hits the road, and we get into the real stuff like who gets the kids, who gets the university place, who gets the good job, and who gets a long prison sentence because their ex wants to say, 'yes, we did it like bunny rabbits for 5 years, but the last time was just horrible, I didn't want to and he should have known!', IT IS A ZERO SUM GAME To me, and my 'unconsciously biased' and 'white privileged' and 'arsehole and the cause of all human problems' eyes, feminism is not about equality, it is about increasingly advantaging group A (women) at the detriment of group B (men). And not a bit, crazy much. Don't get me wrong, most of this - except the kids bit - won't affect elite men and women, the top 5% can build their own businesses and make themselves the boss, feminism can't and won't attempt to influence this sort of thing. Their exes, who are likely also elites, will have too much to lose by making false claims and grueling through the justice process out for years, so they're unlikely to make them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo selfish men in the top 5% of the income bracket, please stop reading now, enjoy your life, and forget about the enormous lifelong harms and disruptions injustly happening to other men.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow back to the point, IT IS A ZERO SUM GAME. It doesn't have to be - anyone who's had a good relationship with the opposite sex knows that. But as time goes on, I'm beginning to think the feminists who came after the Bolshevik revolution (so not the Suffragettes), were probably girls with pretty bad form sheets (several men, none who lasted) who always intended to create a zero sum game where women 'win' and men lose. Now of course, feminism clearly accepts the inevitable side effect of creating a zero sum game involving sex and/or marriage with the rules totally tilted against one player - the marriages don't last so well anymore. This is also not an accident, destabilizing marriage where monogamous, lifelong male female marriage becomes an exception rather than a norm was a primary goal of post Bolshevik feminism very early. You can see it in the Philippines - which is such an odd country as divorce is still illegal there - who is out there arguing for legalization of divorce? You got it, the women's rights movement. Philippines' divorce law is odd, as no other real country prohibits divorce, and I'm not actually defending the law - it seems outrageous to apply a Catholic standard of divorce for example to atheists, Muslims, or Episcopalians) - my point is, who's agitating for divorce? Feminists. Philippines is a valuable example because what we see is the progressive nature of feminism.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst it's divorce, fine, that's gender neutral. Then it's no-fault divorce, well, fine, still gender neutral, although it causes massive spike in the divorce rate. But now the zero-sum part comes in - courts award custody of children to mothers, hey not so gender neutral, more zero-sum. Then, we've suddenly got a significant percentage of the population being divorced women with kids - hey the state needs to look after them. So there's welfare for single parents, again zero-sum with women 'winning' as they are the single parents. Now divorce is a cost-free option, because the state will carry the tab. Then UNMARRIED single mothers say, 'hey, what about me!', so now anyone who has a baby gets looked after by the state.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was once on a motorbike in Thailand. And a sad-looking, young-looking, not-pretty-looking Dutch woman came after me like a Cheetah wanting to mate with a Dachshund. All over me, wanting to come to my room. I must have friended her on Facebook or something, but did not go with her suggestion she come and stay in my room. A few years later I look on Facebook, sure enough a little white baby boy is born in Holland, sans-father. I don't blame this woman for having a baby, she was lonely and wanted one, and the Dutch state took care of the tab.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo that's one zero-sum game. But let's get now to couples, people who marry or are de-factos. If you live in any western country here's how it goes: You'd better forgive her for her occasional adulterous 'indiscretions' or 'you'll get what's coming to you'. If you've got kids, she'll get them - if you fight hard enough you'll get to see them, sometimes. She'll decide where they go to school, what they eat, wear, what out of school activities they do, what religion or no religion they follow, and how many boyfriends she brings back to meet them. If you have daughters, they will have the fortune of seeing and having modelled that women can have a 'healthy sexuality' as the wife leaves her husband and brings back a series of male lovers over a period of years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh and of course, the money. Elites are a little bit different. But for the majority of the population, she'll get most of the assets - even if it was paid for by the husband's earnings. She'll also get a regular cut of your income - after all husbands should pay for the care of children they're denied to see, that's perfectly fair, isn't it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen there's jobs. Got a profession like nursing or teaching predominantly female - that's fine. I went to a bank the other today and out of the 10 staff in the bank, 1 was male, the rest including manager and all seniors female. The lady Asian teller, who I'm normally very friendly with, got quite angry when I suggested it didn't look like the best bank branch for male job applicants. All deans of all faculties female (like RMIT University in Melbourne was), fine, most paediatric doctors female, fine. Too many senior board executives male - OH NO WE MUST FIX IT. Jobs predominantly male must have female quotas, jobs predominantly female should be left alone - ZERO SUM GAME people. Boy Scouts must allow girls, Girl Guides need not allow boys. I saw in the newspaper in Melbourne today that Geelong Grammar can discriminate and give scholarships only to girls. Does anyone reading this believe that any mixed private school in Melbourne would be given dispension to give scholarships only to boys?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo it's zero-sum game across the board: children, relationships, marriage, school, jobs...but let's get to the really good one, 'crimes against women and children'. So all this stuff I've mentioned above would still not keep down an entrepreneurial man who runs his own business. If he is his own boss, well, it's easy for him to hide income so his ex gets less - which would tend to press her to the negotiating table re: the kids - and he won't pass himself over for promotion because he is a man in his own business, so his own talent is his only limit. Now such a man might get uppity, and think he was equal with women, and go around doing a lot offensive male things like being assertive, picky about a women's sexual background and divorce history, and just being self-confident and living without fear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan this really be tolerated? The feminists came up with the solution to that one too, let's change the law whenever a guy is charged with a crime against a woman - ie. the ex girlfriend who cries rape. Let's reveal his identity in the newspaper, but make hers protected upon penalty of contempt of court. Let's make him testify in open court, but let's let her testify remotely via video. Oh and if there's a hung jury, because some sexist jury member goes, 'oh wait, she was banging him the Tuesday before, and sexting, but how come she's saying rape on the Thursday?', guess what - she doesn't have to testify again, the court can just reply her recorded testimony. Oh yeah, and we can't ask her about her sexual history, or say that the fact, you know, she had sex with her boyfriend for years might mean it wasn't rape. I'm not making this stuff up - it differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but there are a complete raft of these laws trying to engineer convictions. It often works, but not always. I spoke to a female former teacher of mine from University years ago, and she told me about a rape trial she was a jury member on. Finally the jury didn't convict because the 'victim' about an hour after her rape went and had sex with her boyfriend - the sexist jury didn't believe that a woman who was raped by her friend (not a cheating girlfriend, how dare you!) would go and then have sex with her boyfriend an hour later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank God I've never had to deal with false charges brought against me - and let's face it, the system would grind to a halt if it started getting out of hand - but just the fear of false claim again is used to oppress and strike fear into the hearts of men. I'm not that worried by it, but mostly because I don't want to have flings with tarty looking girls with bad histories, and I think every man in his right mind would be aware of this and have some sort of risk management plan for it - this, itself, is fear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook, I've gone on and on, and I could go on and on even further. But I won't. I would celebrate Women's Day if it wasn't for the fact that it's really, 'help women, harm men' day. It doesn't have to be like this, but it likely will continue to be so for the rest of our lives. In summation I have one point:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeminists realise their objective is a ZERO SUM GAME where there is a definite winner (women) and loser (men). Men and women who are not feminists need to realise the same thing, and the sooner the better.",

    "text": "Swedish view on the International mens day. This is a news article from 2014 posted by SRP3 (swedish radio program 3) which is a government funded radio station. It´s a bit to read and i am to lazy to translate it by myself so i´d just run it through google translate so im sorry if the grammar is bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe title of the article is Three arguments for and against the international mensday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJenny Claesson is an equality expert and marketing manager at AddGender. She lists her three best reasons why we need a man's day.\n\nFor:\n\n1. Talking about men as a group\n\n\\- Men are used to seeing themselves as belonging to a group. Which is important and needed for everyone. It is important not to forget to talk about them as a group.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Lifting problems for men\n\n\\- We often talk about problems for women. That is why we should do the same for men. For example, it can be tough for many men in working life. Men's companies are more likely to go bankrupt than women's, in terms of work injuries and deaths at work, men are an extremely large majority.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Gender equality\n\n\\- Are we serious about the gender equality debate and our fight for an equal society needs a man's day. Otherwise, it can be difficult to achieve equality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgainst:\n\nLucas Gottzén is a masculinity researcher and associate professor of social work at Linköping University. He lists the three arguments against International Men's Day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. All days are already man's days\n\n\\- We do not need another day when men's excellence is recognized. Men are already filling the medial room to the breaking point. All days are already man's days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Men are not oppressed\n\n\\- International Men's Day is an organization that, in the name of equality, believes that men are oppressed and discriminated against in society. The research shows that it is just the opposite. IN\n\nin particular, we white, heterosexual middle-class men are constantly making the highest profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Does not need any male role models\n\n\\- International Man's Day wants to highlight the need for male role models. We don't need any men\n\nmodels. We might rather need more silly and chicken examples. And instead of chasing male role models, we should question our morbid need to constantly divide the world into two genders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source](https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1646&artikel=6022504)",

    "text": "What International Men's Day Means to Me Hey guys, I'm Charlie!\n\nAs we all hopefully know, today (November 19th) is International Men's Day. Currently, i'm in my dorm at school here in Massachusetts. I (as well as others) have tried multiple times today to start a respectful dialogue about what this day means to me and others around me and no one wants to listen. Fortunately, I think you guys will. Im sorry if its too long or if this isn't the right place for it but here goes:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst a little background\n\nI grew up in a female dominated household where there was my 2 sisters, my mom, my dad and I. I took after my dad and I am a very sensitive and emotional person as a whole. Im pretty tall but super thin, basically everything that isn't a stereotype for a \"Real Man\". I'm still in my late teens in my second year of school here in MA. I came here from an all boys high school, quite conservative, very jock-y/athletic based school (i'm a musician/actor so it was tough). We can call that place HS. After finishing my time there, I came to my current school to try and pursuit my art more (referred to as CS). Here, the political spectrum is more of a single point on a graph. You either follow suit and believe in everything that everyone around you believes (extremely left leaning, heavy feminist views) or you face the wrath of the school. I am personally a big advocate for... not that stuff, and I have gotten a reputation for it as well. \n\nin HS, I got bullied, a lot. Not being in any athletic programs and spending all my time doing musicals and playing in the rock band made a lot of people assume a lot of things about me. Even once what I was doing started to be less of a crazy thing, I never realized how much of an effect it will have on you to be in a place where you feel you aren't accepted. Feeling this way for so long I was so relieved when I finished and was going to get the chance to be in a place where everyone was like me and everyone could do and say what they want without fear of becoming \"that guy\". \n\nShockingly this is not what I encountered. My first spring break at this school (spring break 2019) International Women's Day rolled around and everyone I knew was talking about it. I asked a group of people, honestly, \"When is International Men's Day?\" and the first response I got was \"All respect lost\". That situation spiraled into a multi-hour long conversation, Me vs. \\~5-10 women. I tried hard to be respectful and I even told them that I wasn't doing this to try and take away from their day, I was just wondering. The backlash lasted for the rest of that year and even into this year. People walk around and when they see me they would put their hand up high and say \"Men are up here\" and then lower their hands and say \"And women down here right?\". \n\nEveryone thought that me asking about this important day, me wanting to know what day out of the 364 options (that is excluding women's day) I would get to see people talk and celebrate me, and my dad who sacrifices everything for me and my family every day. Or even the incredible men that came before and made amazing strides in almost every field imaginable but may have not gotten their recognition. \n\nToday was the first International Men's Day that I was aware of. I woke up this morning and I was proud. I wrote my father and his father thanking them for being the role models they are. And I walked into the dining hall and said nothing. And neither did anyone else. At all. Noon rolled around and I brought it up. I would say to my friends with excitement, \"Today is International Men's Day\" and they would laugh, thinking I was acknowledging it ironically as they were. I tried exclaiming to them that today is important and they laughed in my face about how every day is mens day and how me advocating for today is hurting them as women. Even teachers and administrators said \"Isn't that every day\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd not one person knew how bad that hurt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt hurt because I have suffered from depression and anxiety. It hurt because no one thanked my dad when he worked his 16+ hour days. It hurt because every day in one of my classes we learn about historic/important people on their birthday and there wasn't a single male name read today. It hurt because on my campus I am not free to share my political views because I'm a straight white male and my bias means what I think is wrong. \n\nMost of all, it hurt because I am a Man. I am proud to be a man and no one can take that away from me. It hurt because to the people around me, that is wrong. And people think it's funny that it makes me sad and emotional. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut i'm here to say, to all of the men out there that may not have been told, or maybe have been told the opposite,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are incredible. You may be the reason someones life changes for the better. You could be the only thing thats getting someone through. And god damn if you do something incredible, don't let anyone take that away from you. You deserve the credit you earn, you are worthy of this day and you are the definition of what it means to \"be a man\".  Regardless of whether you're the strongest guy in the room or the smallest. Regardless of whether you bring tissues to the movie theater or manage to watch Marley and Me without tearing up, because you are enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope all of you enjoy this day. Have a beer for those of us who \"can't\" ;)",

    "text": "Low pay gender discrimination in Australia If you live in Australia - and this applies generally in Western countries - you will hear the moaning and complaining about women having a pay gap with men. Women have all the bad jobs, men are arseholes who murder their wives, and we need to rape the reputation of men as a group and provide the good jobs to women not men on the basis of gender to make all this iniquity right.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou've heard the spiel, right.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo this I have two words of response: Taxi. Driver. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course women usually primarily care for young children, and schools during the day primarily care for older children. Sure there are exceptions, higher earning mum goes out to work, dad stays home and enjoys himself with baby - good on them. Not many women want that, they want to mother the babies and they want hubby to earn well to make it easy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGiven this, and how competitive it is to reach senior positions in competitive workplaces (ie. all workplaces), I find it not surprising that there are so few married women with children in the highest levels of management, eg. board level or senior exec. I find it extraordinary and manipulated - although given the endless rounds of women promotion (literally, like into the juicy senior job everyone wants) and male reputation tarnishing I'm not surprised - that THAT THERE ARE SO MANY WOMEN IN VERY SENIOR POSITIONS. Sometimes you get a talented go-getter who gives up everything including family for career - Julie Bishop, the former foreign minister of Australia, is a good example of this. She earned it. However, given the time out for family commitments, it boggles my mind that married women with multiple children would make it to the top without being given the job based on their possession of a vagina. In other words, you need manipulation in the extreme in favour of female applicants and against male ones to get the numbers of senior women in the workplace we have now, let alone this being an example of discrimination AGAINST women.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's get back to taxi drivers. In Australia being a taxi driver has been one of the lowest status jobs out there. They work insane hours to support families and typically earn somewhere around $8 an hour, in a socialist country like Australia where minimum wage is set at around the low $20s per hour. They have to sit all day long, which is awful for health and posture, they're exposed to the sun, they have to deal with sometimes drunk and abusive customers and not uncommonly physical assaults. Surely if we want to help low income earners, taxi drivers would be the perfect place to start. Surely a few rallies to parliament house, some politicians speaking out for them, the charities and social services organisations prioritizing taxi drivers income. Well....not exactly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny guess why not? It wouldn't be anything to do with the fact that something like 98% of taxi drivers are men, would it? In Australia, Indian immigrant men, by the way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook, if like me you have a dick, and one or two testicles swinging on either side of it, you're not going to get any airtime. You're the aresehole, remember? So that taxi driver who earns $8 an hour is the arsehole, oppressing that focused white or Asian early 40s women who gets promoted to chair of the board and earns a few million yearly. But he's got a dick, so we already know he's bad, so why am I even writing this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMen I have no idea what to do in a society that hates my gender so much. I mean for us as a group, on an individual personal level there's usually plenty we can do. The way I see it, things went so nuts so quickly all I can see is at least making men INTERNALLY aware of how the system is stacked against them. I share many others' skepticism of any positive change to men's conditions through the political process, or even a willingness to block their further erosion through more and more man-hatred expressed through law and social beliefs. The only thing I believe I can do beyond the personal level is to at least make as many men as possible aware of the how under siege we, as a gender, have become.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck to all, but most particularly to Indian male taxi drivers, and least particularly to wealthy early 40s CEOs of large companies who got there mainly because they had a vagina.",

Formal critics include the [Federalist Society](https://regproject.org/wp-content/uploads/RTP-Race-Sex-Working-Group-Paper-Campus-Misconduct-Proceedings.pdf), [Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/crime-and-justice/report/campus-sexual-assault-understanding-the-problem-and-how-fix-it), [National Association of Scholars](https://www.nas.org/articles/nas_applauds_secretary_devos_decision_on_title_ix),[ California Governor Jerry Brown](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-browns-title-ix-veto-1508280834), [Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg](https://reason.com/blog/2018/02/19/ruth-bader-ginsburg-due-process-me-too),  [American College of Trial Lawyers](https://www.actl.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/position-statements-and-white-papers/task_force_allegations_of_sexual_violence_white_paper_final.pdf), and [Reason Foundation](https://reason.com/blog/2017/09/07/betsy-devos-rape-ocr-title-ix-campus).\n\nMoreover, courts that have heard cases involving OCR’s Title IX  procedures have often strongly denounced them. Examples include  condemnatory opinions from the [Second Circuit of Appeals](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/15-1536/15-1536-2016-07-29.html) and the [Sixth Circuit of Appeals](http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/18a0200p-06.pdf). In a recent [Seventh Circuit of Appeals](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/17-3565/17-3565-2019-06-28.html)  opinion, Judge Barrett stated that “Purdue’s process fell short of what  even a high school must provide to a student facing a days-long  suspension.” Professor KC Johnson [has covered the case in greater detail. ](https://www.city-journal.org/john-doe-v-purdue-univ)\n\nObama’s OCR espoused a particular brand of radical feminism.  According to this doctrine, taught across the nation in women’s studies  departments, men have brutalized women since the beginning of history.  Past oppression must be remedied through government intervention,  eliminating the due process principles that are meant to protect every  American.\n\nThe perils of government tyranny aside*,* the fundamental  assumptions of the “patriarchy theory” cannot survive rational scrutiny.  While it is true that women were historically denied various rights,  they have also been sheltered from grievous harm (combat, for example).  Also, analysis of federal aggregate data from the United States  demonstrates that women are [as likely to engage in sexual coercion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062022/) against men as [vice versa](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178916301446?via%3Dihub), which undermines the “patriarchy” narrative.\n\nAt any rate, past historical wrongs cannot be rectified by unfair treatment in the present, as the Eighth Circuit stated in [this ruling](https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca8/18-3077/18-3077-2019-03-06.pdf?ts=1551889833).\n\nOCR’s historical record speaks to its lack of fairness. The agency  authored a total of 255 resolution letters (formal decisions in a case)  from 2012 to 2019.\n\n[Pekgoz summarizes the circumstances in a Synthetic Analysis](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ea7b71_a751c44c74dc4e8fa8f35666ab9b81a1~mv2_d_3812_2108_s_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_3812,h_2108/PrintScreen%2C%20Synthetic%20Analysis.jpg).\n\nThe analysis shows that whenever OCR wrote a resolution letter  between 2012 and 2019 to adjudicate adversarial proceedings between  female and male parties, they sided with the female 216 times but only 9  times with the male (2400% more likely to side with the female). Their extreme partisanship is clear in every  aspect of Title IX.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Athletics.** The Department’s athletics compliance tests have been [rightfully criticized](https://www.nccivitas.org/2010/title-ix-blind-quota-system-or-how-kneecap-college-sports/)  for imposing unconstitutional quotas. The agency sided with female  athletes 63 times, but sided with the male only once between 2012 and  2019. The only resolution letter favorable for male athletes is the [Temple University Letter](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/03142257-a.pdf).\n* **Grading.** The Department sided with female students who alleged [discrimination](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/06112126-a.pdf) in [grading](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11162077-a.pdf) on [multiple occasions](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/15132147-a.pdf), while dismissing [very similar allegations by male students](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/07132238-a.pdf).\n* **Retaliation.** The Department sided with female  complainants alleging retaliation on many occasions. There are at least  23 letters in this category, such as the [Jacksonville State University Letter](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/04142086-a.pdf)  where the agency sided with a “falsely accused” woman. There is no  clear example of the Department siding with a male student alleging  retaliation on the basis of sex, [but dismissal letters do exist](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/10111376-a.pdf).\n* **Sexual Harassment.** Male students who petitioned the  agency to allege bias in sexual harassment disputes (either as the  accused, or the accuser) had a success rate of 1.1 percent during  2012-2019 (6/532). The Department was very aggressive when it came to  siding with female accusers while consistently dismissing the concerns  of accused males. This is despite male students often suffering  life-altering consequences, such as expulsion or a permanent notation on  their transcript, in addition to severe emotional distress. [Some have committed suicide](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/05/02/title-ix-cases-resulted-suicide-suicide-attempt-two-colleges-prompt-fresh-debate).\n* **Reasonableness.** OCR urged schools to get rid of the  “reasonable person” standard at least twice:  One letter involved a  female student who accused a male teacher of [staring at her breasts for 3-4 seconds](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/09141376-a.pdf). Another letter involved a costly systemic review because very young students [were playing “National Grab Ass Day”](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11131106-a.pdf) during play time. The agency even sided with a female student whose claims of sexual violence [were disproven via DNA evidence](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/15112115-a.pdf).\n* **Due Process.** While sending a dismissal letter to an accused male student, OCR argued that [“due process” is not covered by Title IX](https://www.scribd.com/document/426012564/Samuel-Meritt-University-Dismissal).  As long as the accused is a man, that is. Federal bureaucrats  aggressively sided with women who were accused of various sexual  infractions. On one occasion, the Department condemned a university for  allowing a male [to file a counter-claim](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11116001-a.pdf) of misconduct against a female student. Another time, the agency [threatened a university](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/01102089-a.pdf)  with loss of federal funding for pressing fraud charges against a woman  who made false accusations. There is also an example of OCR using [defamation theory to side with a female complainant](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11141175-a.pdf), even though the agency has never accepted any complaints concerning the damaged reputations of accused men.\n* **Single-Sex Programs.** Women are the majority of college students, but many colleges offer dozens of support programs [for women only](https://www.jamesgmartin.center/2019/05/identity-politics-versus-basic-logic-should-colleges-offer-affirmative-action-for-the-female-majority/).  Whenever male complainants challenge female-only programs, such as  women’s centers or STEM camps for girls, the Department has dismissed  their complaints on various pretexts. One popular pretext is that these  female-only programs cannot be challenged unless men specifically apply  to them and receive rejections, thus creating a putative victim.  However, OCR has resolved [procedural complaints in the absence of any victim](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/02152290-a.pdf) on many occasions, as long as the objective [was consistent with their agenda. ](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/03121217-a.pdf)\n* **American Psychological Association (APA) Guidelines.** OCR dismissed a Title IX complaint challenging the APA guidelines, which sought to [classify masculinity as a mental illness factor](https://www.dailywire.com/news/46458/foia-request-reveals-boston-title-ix-office-has-ashe-schow).  This was despite serious public outcry against those guidelines. In the  dismissal letter, officials argued that Title IX cannot be applied in a  manner that would interfere with curricular materials. That was false.  OCR has aggressively interfered with [the training materials](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11142219-a.pdf) and [the curricular materials](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11131096-a.pdf) of [various colleges](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/10131040-a.pdf) as long as doing so furthers their gender agenda.\n* **Administrative Closure.** OCR has a rule requiring  the dismissal of pending complaints if similar allegations have been  filed elsewhere. This rule is rigorously applied [to male students to dismiss their Title IX complaints.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3479594-Stanford-University-09-15-2324.html) However, when [female students file complaints against their institutions](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/office-civil-rights-launches-investigation-university-southern-californias-handling-sexual-harassment-claims), administrative closure is not applied to dismiss their allegations.\n\nSome might assume that OCR has received few meritorious complaints  from male students. According to a Freedom of Information Act request,  however, the Department received [532 complaints](https://www.scribd.com/document/426016051/FOIA-All-532-Cases-With-545-Relevant-Allegations) from men in the sexual harassment category alone between 2011 and 2019.\n\nThe Department of Education became a hive of identity politics under  Obama and there is little evidence of improvement. The modest reforms  proposed by Secretary Betsy DeVos have not yet been implemented.\n\nResolution letters published under the Trump administration perpetuate the Obama doctrines. For example, [the Stanford University letter](https://provost.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/04/OCR-Redacted-Stanford-Letter-of-Finding.pdf) tried to eliminate the reasonable person standard. [The Butte-Glenn Community College letter](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/09132096-a.pdf) involved a retroactive review of many old complaints, demanding the creation of a complex bureaucracy. [The Buffalo State University letter](https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/media/OCR-SUNY-Buffalo-State.pdf) wrongfully claimed that off-campus incidents fall under the jurisdiction of Title IX, [despite case law to the contrary.](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-8th-circuit/1410731.html)\n\nUnsurprisingly, some politicians want to abolish the entire Department of Education. Representative Thomas Massie has [introduced a bill](https://massie.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rep-massie-introduces-bill-to-abolish-federal-department-of-education)  to do just that. While we cannot predict whether the Department will  ever be abolished, we must never cease our vigilance against our very  own *Ministry of Love.* \n\n*Kursat Christoff Pekgoz is a PhD student at the University of Southern California.*\n\n*James E. Moore, II is professor of industrial and systems  engineering; public policy and management; and civil engineering at the  University of Southern California.*\n\n[*https://www.jamesgmartin.center/2019/10/the-ministry-of-love-ongoing-gender-partisanship-in-the-department-of-education/*](https://www.jamesgmartin.center/2019/10/the-ministry-of-love-ongoing-gender-partisanship-in-the-department-of-education/)",

This is a throwaway account.  \n\n\nI work for the federal government.  I believe my manager discriminated against me in my performance review so I filed an EEO complaint.  You used to be able to make a case with facts, and if the agency agreed, your manager would revise the performance review.  \n\n\nHowever, after the President signed 2018 Executive Order 13839, Agencies now say they are not allowed to modify performance reviews - even if there was discrimination.  (It's in Section 5).  \n\n\nI'm know the President did not mean for this to happen.  It's not through Congress, it's through the White House.  How can we change it?
