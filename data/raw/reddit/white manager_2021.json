    "text": "I got an entry-level job and I’m fxcking pissed. **TL;DR The system worked for me and I'm tired of the job market being like this. Can anything be done on a grand scale or should I just network throughout my career to help individuals? Also, this is dramatic- sorry.**\n\nI graduated in December 2019. This summer, I got a job in marketing. I made 43k (21/hr) and usually only had to  work 25-30 hours a week. It was awesome and a major step up from my previous job in allied health where I made 27k/year or 13/hr. I went above and beyond and even created a training document to teach coworkers how to edit HTML code because some days I’d be done after 2 hours. I have ADHD, an average IQ, and have a 2.6 GPA Psychology B.A..\n\nThe reason I’m fxcking pissed is because *they lied*. By \"they\" I mean the employer, but I also mean everyone in my society who told me that I need a bachelor's or a master's to do tasks in an office that I could’ve done as a freshman in high school. I swear to god a 14 year old who knows basic grammar could do this job EASILY. So why does it say bachelor’s degree required? Why does it say 1-2 years of experience when 2 weeks of training was all I needed to learn this job? It’s so fxcking easy that I literally have spent entire work days learning javascript because there were no more tasks to do.\n\nThere are so many people who can’t access jobs like these because they didn’t have the time, energy, or access to money (*or people)* that would allow them to get through this barrier. I’m not done either because every day I hear from people who have their psych degree or communications degree, heck even their STEM degree saying they can’t find any entry level jobs. So the people that hunkered down for 4 years are now considering more years of their lives, more time, and more energy to get a master’s degree for the chance of getting an entry level job.\n\nSo how tf did I get this entry level, marketing job? My friend handed my resume to the marketing manager and said “she’s a hard worker” and then after a 20 minute conversation about what TV shows I like (oh wait that was an interview with the CTO) and an interview with the marketing manager, I was hired on. I do not think I would be where I am now, halfway through my student loans and deciding which mutual funds to invest in, without my closest friend happening to work at a place that hires entry level employees. Most of the people at this company knew someone working there already. The coworkers that got in through traditional applying had multiple years of experience and were much older than me. It’s bullshit.\n\nl got a lucky break in order to make a livable wage. If this didn’t happen, I would have gone into more debt for SLP school, and add myself to the pile of 25-year-olds still living with their parents, because I couldn’t figure out a better way to make more than $15 an hour with a psych degree. I recently accepted an offer making 15k more and I feel like I’m stepping on people who didn’t happen to have a “white-collar” friend to get their foot in the door. I bet this new job doesn’t really require a degree either, ***but how else can they parse the thousands of applications they get whenever they post a job?*** I plan to pay it forward whenever I can throughout my career. I can’t think of another way to help this system.\n\n**Edit:** I love that this is a topic people are interested in. I especially value the critical comments because they alert me to aspects I might not have considered before. \nI want to make a final point that I've already made in the comments. \n\n**If there were more options to make a living wage then there wouldn't be this level of oversaturation.** Can everyone agree on that?? The people that say \"learn a trade\" don't see that if all the new high school grads learn a trade then the wages of plumbers, electricians, welders, etc. will drop and the barriers to entry will rise. I assume the trades are next. \n\nMy surface level understanding is that no one wants their kids/students to be excluded from comfortable pay. So they say \"finish highschool to get a good job.\" But it doesn't really work anymore if **everyone** finishes high school because **there aren't enough good paying jobs**. So they say finish college. Still not enough to go around. \"Should've picked a STEM, should've learned to code.\"\n\nThis is the \"industry treadmill\" that I disike. You can disagree and say that not everyone deserves to afford a dignified life, but I haven't found one comment arguing that this industry treadmill doesn't exist out of 200 replies. \n\nWill the market even things out or will this lead to your kids needing a PHD in order to afford a 2br house? (Im being dramatic again- notice a trend?) If not those, then what? Who knows. This trend(edit 2: mainly improvements/solutions to the trend) has levels of complexity that I don't understand yet. I plan to learn. If you are interested too, please do your own research. Don't let it end here. Feel free to comment or send me any info you come across even if it challenges my beliefs. Thanks!",

    "text": "Rant: Don't just take any damn job. Make sure they care about you and look for red flags So I turned down a job offer that I was peeved about when I thought about the interview experience. \n\nFirst of all, I have been unemployed for +6 months, so a lot of people will probably say \"take it and look for something else\". Which normally, I would agree with.\n\nThing is, my profession is a white collar job mixed with blue collar expectations. Meaning there can be dangerous work, and I'm not talking about using forklifts or moving boxes, no, I'm talking about working with hazardous materials.\n\nAnyway, this company that I interviewed for was only one interview with the hiring manager. I sat down, and they asked me \"For this job, we need someone for nights for a bit during this transition period, can you do this?\" I said \"sure, I can work nights for a bit\". \n\nAnd that was pretty much the only question they asked of me.\n\nWe toured the area, and I asked the hiring manager questions, but something still bugged me. I then asked the exact working hours, and they rambled, but I just smiled and nodded.\n\nThen I left, sent a thank you note, and a few days later, got a call for an offer. But again, I asked about the exact working hours for nights, and they revealed that the working hours are still undetermined for nights.\n\nThen I looked at all the red flags presented to me:\n\n- They didn't vet me at all. It really seemed they only wanted a body to work nights for an unspecified amount of time to \"help them in a time of transition\". It also makes me question their efforts into hiring new talent and the people I would be working with.\n\n- The training they would give me would only be for a few days during day shifts, then I would be thrown to nights by myself\n\n- Not specifying the hours after I asked about them twice tells me that after this \"transition period\" they will probably want me to permanently be on nights, which I'm not ok with\n\nSo really, I'm not ok with a company that isn't straightforward with their employees. I understand being in a transition period has a lot of scrambling around, but an accident on nights is bound to happen that way, and I want to keep my head. Literally.\n\nI know some people will probably call me an idiot, but my gut feeling was that this work opportunity wasn't good. I didn't leave with a satisfied impression that they cared about the talent they brought in. Makes me a bit upset since it was located in a good area, wish it would have been different.\n\n\nWhat are some red flags you found for a job offer/interview?",

    "text": "How do you get your resume to beat the Applicant Tracking System? (ATS)  If you've been submitting tons of applications without so much as a nibble or bite from a recruiter, there's a decent chance you're not even getting past the ATS a company is using for their job postings.\n\nFor 99% of tech jobs today, you’re likely going to be submitting a resume and an application into an Applicant Tracking System. An Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is software that companies employ to help them automate and organize the recruitment, hiring, and human resources side of an organization. These ATSs help companies navigate through tens of thousands of applicants to be able to find the right candidates for them. Instead of having to physically wade through stacks of resumes and applications, these systems do most of that heavy lifting work for recruiters. More than that, modern ATSs come equipped with machine learning to help an organization identify key words and patterns to quickly compile a list of most ideal candidates.\n\nThis sounds great if you’re a recruiter who actively uses these systems to become more efficient. However, if you’re hunting for tech jobs, these systems can automatically reject you without giving you a chance. If you’re under-qualified, over-qualified, come from the wrong educational background, don’t use enough specific key words for a job, or even have some odd formatting in your resume - you can be automatically rejected even if you’d be a very strong candidate for the role you just applied for.\n\n**How does an ATS work?**\n\nThere are many ATSs in the market, and they’re not all going to work exactly the same. Some of the heavy hitters are:\n\n* Taleo\n* Greenhouse\n* WorkDay\n* iCIMS\n* Successfactors\n* Brassring\n* and many more\n\nWhile they may have differences, ATSs will all focus on being able to accept a large volume of applications and resumes and organize those appropriately. This organization comes in the form of eliminating candidates via knockout questions, ranking resumes, ranking candidates, and then housing the lifecycle of the recruitment process for human resources employees. ATSs will rank and eliminate candidates based off of analysis on application questions and resume parsing.\n\nThe larger the company, the higher of amount of candidates they’ll receive. Therefore, it’s imperative for an organization to use an ATS to help automate resume parsing for recruiting. For example, Taleo (which is one of the most used ATSs among Fortune 500 companies) is well known for using a resume parser. The way Taleo’s parser works is by scanning for specific sections such as Education, Work Experience, Skills. For each given section, the parser will look for patterns. For Education, the parser will look for a date range, a degree title, and a university name. When a parser is not able to adequately scrape this data, it’ll likely return a null value which will negatively affect your candidacy score or might even altogether eliminate you from contention.\n\nFormatting Tips\n\nTherefore, it’s important to follow these formatting tips:\n\n* A resume that is uploaded in a .docx (or even .doc) format will be more easily read and parsed than a .pdf file for a multitude of reasons.  \n\n   * When you’re presenting your resume to a recruiter or hiring manager directly, a .pdf file might be a more presentable version of a resume. However, if you’re uploading a resume to an ATS, always go with a .docx version instead. It is easier for a resume interpreter to take apart the text strings in a .doc file than having to interpret text from a .pdf file.\n   * Whether you’re using Microsoft Word or Google Docs, most of these editors allow for saving in either format. It’s not a bad idea to export your resume into both file types to have handy.\n* Stay clear of using headers and footers. If you do decide to use them, do not bury important information there since parsers will struggle to make sense of that data.  \n\n   * For example, if you have relevant keywords in your footer, there’s a decent chance the parser struggles to pull that out and will altogether ignore your relevant skill.\n* Make sure to follow clean date and naming syntax for Education and Work Experience:  \n\n   * \\[START DATE\\] - \\[END DATE/PRESENT\\] - \\[DEGREE\\] in \\[FIELD OF STUDY\\] at \\[UNIVERSITY/COLLEGE\\]\n   * Example for education: April 2015 - November 2019 - B.S. in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin\n   * \\[START DATE\\] - \\[END DATE/PRESENT\\] - \\[COMPANY\\] - \\[JOB TITLE\\]\n   * Example for work: April 2015 - November 2019 - Google - Senior QA Engineer  \nEducation\n\nThese formatting tips will make sure that you aren’t automatically disqualified for a job because the parser can’t even read your resume. This is the equivalent to training for the Olympics for years only to be disqualified in the last minute because the documents you presented had a typo on your name that doesn’t match your official identification. Okay, that’s a pretty awful analogy, but the 2020 Olympics are about to get started and I’m pumped for that.\n\nKeyword Tips\n\nThe formatting part of a resume is the absolute basic requirement you need to nail down. After that, we need to focus on keywords. One of the ways that an ATS will rank you is by searching for specific relevant keywords. For example, if the job application is for a Software Engineer with experience in React, .NET, C#, SQL, etc. - then you can expect the hiring manager and recruiter to supply the ATS with those types of keywords to parse. When a resume parser starts analyzing a resume for keywords, it will start keeping track of the number of occurrences of the configured keywords.\n\nA recruiter can set any specific keyword to be worth extra points. Depending on the weight of points for any given keyword, your resume could either be instantly rejected (by not scoring any points for a given keyword), OR be graded highly if you match with a lot of the keywords they’re looking for.\n\nTherefore, it’s paramount that you look at a job description, analyze the skills they’re asking for, and make sure you highlight those skills as much as possible (and accurately, don’t lie).\n\n**Word of caution** \\- if you think you can game this system by sneaking in certain keywords into your resume by “hiding” this text in white colored font, be warned. Typing in the word “React” 20 times in hidden text might game a few ATSs, sure (though they’re placing more controls against this now), however, your resume will often be converted into plain text for a preview view for a hiring manager to see. When this happens, your attempts at cheating will be painfully apparent and you can guarantee you’re instantly eliminated.\n\nOne last important note on formatting for keywords is that some recruiters have mentioned how rigid Taleo’s keyword matching can be that they have to put various boolean operators in their search parameters to get as many relevant matches as possible. For example, if a recruiter is looking for a Product Manager and a resume lists Product Management, certain ATSs won’t even match that to the job description. Therefore, like you would with a SQL query where you combine multiple search parameters, a recruiter might add keywords such as “Product Manager” & “Product Management” & “Product Owner” in order to encompass as many resume keywords as possible.\n\nLastly, while this post isn’t about writing the perfect resume, it is about getting past resume parsers. This means that you really should be spell-checking your resume. When it comes to tech jobs, this means that many of the keywords you’ll be listing will not exist in Microsoft or Google’s built-in spell-check libraries. Your text editor may or may not flag when you misspell tech keywords like “MVC”, “Mongo”, “mySQL”, “elasticSearch”, etc. - you get the idea. If you mess these keywords up, the parser will not be able to interpret your skills as relevant ones and quickly rule you out. Take the time and verify your keywords carefully - it is the single greatest determinant for your resume’s success in an ATS.",

He told me that 'other people are saying' or potentially talking to management about me. There's rumours that I sit down too much during downtime. That I'm on my phone too much. That I'm not answering the door when we get clients. Here's the problem... I don't think I sit down a lot. I leave my phone inside my locker now. I also answer the door when someone knocks. Basically, I have no idea where these rumors are coming from or why and- when I first heard about it- I was very disappointed. I'm not blaming my co-workers or anything. I'm just bummed out that that's the impression I've given.\n\nThankfully, a number of my supervisors and co-workers had my back when management talked to them. They told management that I don't do the things that some other people think I'm doing.\n\nI'm young (26). A lot of my co-workers are older than me (50+). I'm black. My co-workers are white. I'm not from the area. I'm from Ontario. I'm right now in Nova Scotia (Canada). There's also this automatic... let's call it \"hostility\" towards me because I'm getting paid at a higher rate than they were when they started the job. So, I'm already at a disadvantage. I'm pretty sociable. I do make jokes. Not at the same level as the older employees, obviously. But I do carry out conversations.\n\nIn short, I don't know how much of this is legitimate.\n\n***Am I really sitting around too much or do all these other factors put a target on me?***\n\nThe worst part is, word has spread around the warehouse about me being disappointed or bummed out.

    "text": "Avoid common pitfalls of job seekers - some step-by-step advice for those looking for something new I've seen a lot of posts here by people who, in my opinion, are not looking for new opportunities efficiently or effectively. Some of the most popular posts are \"I sent out 100+ resumes and finally got an offer!\". First, that sounds like the job search was horrible. Secondly, that means that you're getting rejected before you even really have a chance to make an impression.\n\nI've conducted dozens of interviews and designed both challenges and best practices around good interview questions and best responses. My fiancee is a former LinkedIn employee who now advises dozens of CEOs and Chief HR Officers (CHROs) on their talent strategy and brand. At the very least, we've thought about the practice of hiring more than most.\n\nA lot of the resumes and interview stories posted on this subreddit would not meet our criteria to move forward, but most of the issues are very fixable.\n\n# Pre-resume screen: make yourself stand out\n\nA couple of quick statistics:\n\n* A huge percentages of job candidates are sourced from LinkedIn these days (75%+ in tech)\n* Employee referrals account for the highest probability of landing in role (and tend to be the highest quality candidates)\n* It's 99% stupid to take a job you're going to hate (Investment Bankers, I'm looking at you to fill in that other 1%)\n\nPut all of these to work.\n\n**Outreach**\n\nYou should be talking to people at a company before applying!!! This is one of the two best uses of LinkedIn. Find a company, find someone near your level, find something in common and reach out on LinkedIn\n\n* Connect with a short, personal message saying that their company caught your attention and you wanted to get a sense of what it's like to work there\n* Your goal is to get a sense of what the company, hours, culture, team members, etc are like. You are screening them (but nicely). Don't ignore red flags\n* At the end, ask them if they'd be willing to introduce you to a recruiter or hiring manager via email, then send your email to them over LinkedIn\n\nYou're doing this both to learn about what you'd be getting into, and to separate yourself from potentially hundreds of other candidates. If introduced, your resume WILL be looked at - after all, it came from an introduction within the company. Get yourself to the top of the pile.\n\n**Inbound**\n\nSome LinkedIn tactics that you can use to make recruiters reach out to you more (manipulating the algorithm).\n\n* Always have your profile receptive to inbound requests. Even if you're happy, if something amazing comes along, why not take a look.\n* Changing your profile bumps your profile rank. Particularly your title. Even if you have the same position, modifying the words of your title can be used to increase inbound. Adding or modifying bullets, or just making improvements will also increase your profile score.\n* If you want recruiters to notice you, respond to them, even (especially?) if the answer is no. \"This isn't a good fit right now, but I'd be interested if you know of any \\[Senior XYZ\\] opportunities\"\n\nYou can quickly go from zero recruiter inbound to 20+ per week by playing games with the algorithm. If you do both of these correctly, you should need to be sending out only a couple of resumes before getting an interview (get your resume in good order though).\n\n# Resumes\n\nI won't cover information that's not covered [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/). Basically, use that template (or something close to it) and follow the advice (e.g. interests - that post is correct, interests are a great way to spark a natural conversation).\n\nMy additional advice here:\n\n* One of the frequent reasons I would skip a resume was too many skills listed. This was mostly from experience. If I got someone on the phone for a screen and asked about the 11th skill they listed it was always answer like \"well, one time I wrote a few lines of code in Ruby\". You should have experience with the skills you list, and you should tailor that list to the job you're applying to.\n* Nearly every bullet point under experience should have not just what you did, but what you accomplished. Increased throughput, increased sales, decreased waiting times, improved a process, etc. If you can attach a number, all the better.\n\n|Instead of this|Put this|\n|:-|:-|\n|Greeter at Walmart|Greeter at Walmart. First point of contact for over 120,000 customers|\n|Database schema design|Architected SQL database schema; reduced standard query times by 74%|\n|Designed XYZ ad campaign|Re-architected XYZ ad campaign leading to 51% increase in clickthrough rate|\n\n* Skills should be skills, not personality traits. Hard working isn't a skill. Arc welding is a skill, Javascript is a skill.\n\nBefore interviews, if companies are playing the salary negotiation game \"U say what u want first, no u, no u\" the easiest way around is this:\n\n\"The other companies that I'm actively engaged with are offer this range \\[high number - very high number\\]. I'm confident I can get a competitive offer from them, but I would like to understand your range as well\"\n\n# Interviews\n\nYou are presenting the person that they want to hire, not being brutally honest in the interview phase. This does not mean lie, this means keep things to yourself that are not appropriate. You wouldn't call your interviewer fat, don't say that you're unmotivated (and if you are, work on yourself - thats your issue). Companies are looking for someone who will add value - be a good fit.\n\n**You should have 5+ stories prepared that make you look hard working, motivated, smart, creative, etc. at hand coming into any interview. Depending on the question, there should be one at your disposal.**\n\nA few common questions and some of the \"best answers\"\n\n* \"*Why do you want to work here?*\" If you've been resume spamming and don't know anything about the job, that's mostly on you. Mentioning salary or hours are also not a good answers. If there's something unique about the product or culture, if you've talked to a bunch of people and like all of them, if there's something hard that will give you an opportunity to grow, mention that.\n* \"*Why are you leaving your current role?*\" The worst answer here is that your work/boss is horrible - from the interviewer's perspective, you're just likely to hate this job as well and leave. If there's one white-lie to tell in an interview it's that you really enjoy the company you're at, but you \"want an opportunity to grow\". Say something positive about your current employment experience.\n* \"*Describe a time when you've had a conflict with another employee?*\" or \"*Describe a time when you received constructive criticism*\" or \"*What is job / task you did that you would have done differently?*\" All of these questions are looking not for the conflict, but for the growth after. Answers like \"Someone got jealous because of how hard I was working\" or \"I tend to take on too much responsibility\" are BS, even if true. \"It's become clear to me that in complex systems, upfront testing will save a lot of time down the road\" or \"I spent a lot of time trying to understand the other person's perspective and work with them\". Again, **have examples ready for these** if you want to really crush your interview.\n* \"*What accomplishment (from your resume) are you most proud of?*\" - This is my favorite question to ask. We're going to take a deep dive, so you'd better have done the work. It doesn't have to be your favorite, however, it should show you in the best light. The best answers are some combination of (1) impactful work (bonus points if you can measure impact) (2) self-suggested (shows motivation) (3) collaborative (4) actual contribution. It's ok if you didn't do parts of the work, but it's not if you try to claim credit for something you clearly know very little about.\n\nFor every single interview you do, unless it's impossible, send a thank you note. It should be 3-5 sentences (really short). \"It was a pleasure to meet you\" \"Thank you for taking the time to speak with me\" \"The people / process / company has been great throughout this process\" \"I look forward to hearing next steps\" etc. You don't need to rehash any question or clarify anything - they were there with you.\n\n# Offer / Negotiation\n\nMost candidates do not negotiate, or even attempt to. You should, except in very rare circumstances. Correctly asking for more will almost never lead to a retraction and similarly will almost never lead to ill will later on. In either case, you probably dodged a bullet.\n\n* A couple of ways to approach:  (1) The other places you're looking offer something better (2) the industry typically pays better for the same experience.\n* First and foremost, you WANT to be working there \"I think your company is a great fit from a skills and culture match\". Again though, it's \"I'm also in active discussions with other companies - you're offering $14/hr and they're offering $18/hr. Given the discrepancy and that the fit is so good, is there any flexibility on salary?\". Here, active discussions could mean \"I sent a resume to them a month ago and nothing has happened\" - you're certainly pursuing the opportunity!\n* The second is \"The industry pays \\[e.g. $70,000 to $90,000\\] for this position and given my experience and skillset of XYZ I think it would be justified to earn the top half of that range.\" They've picked you because you're qualified - it's unlikely that they're just randomly choosing poor quality candidates!\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nDon't stay at a job you hate. Start asking around for alternatives, feel out the culture and make the move. It'll likely end you with a better salary and better mental state. If you're a student, you'll get a huge hit rate on asking for informational interviews from people that went to your school (or otherwise!). Don't be afraid to reach out.",

    "text": "I'm legally blind. I keep being rejected for jobs in the field of mental health when I mention during interviews that I (obviously!) cannot drive a car to transport clients when needed. That's it – I give up! I'm DONE! I'm currently an undergraduate college student in my junior year majoring in Psychology with plans to attend graduate school and get a Master’s degree in mental health counseling to become a therapist (MFT licensure). I live in southern California.\n\nI'm legally blind so I am unable to drive a car. I am completely blind in my left eye and have 20/200 vision in my right. It's blatantly obvious because I wear glasses with one centimeter thick prism-like concave lenses. I have no depth perception nor peripheral vision, but I do have enough functional central vision for ambulatory vision (being able to see objects and move around a room without stumbling or bumping into things) without the need for a white cane. Especially here in southern California where public transportation is nonexistent, not being able to drive makes it nearly impossible to be independent.\n\nI'm trying my best to look for internships or part time jobs where I could work directly with clients struggling with mental health issues. I decided to apply to mental health treatment programs near me (inpatient care, residential treatment facilities, day treatment programs, etc) for direct care staff/mental health technician floor staff positions. I have chosen treatment facilities where clients stay in one place all day long so it's doable for my limitations (i.e, no home based therapy or field based work driving from client to client, so ABA therapy is out of the question – believe me, I've already tried). Every place I have applied to requires a driver's license to transport clients to medical appointments, community outings, etc.\n\nI've managed to land about 7-8 interviews throughout the past month, so I think my resume is pretty good for a college student with limited experience. I do not mention that I am legally blind or anything of that nature on my resume.\n\nHowever, in every single one of these interviews, things go great until I mention \"I'm legally blind so I am unable to drive a car. I do have reliable transportation (paratransit/Uber) to get to work on time and I do not require any additional accommodations otherwise. I just cannot drive clients to appointments or other services in the company vehicle when at the facility. Is that OK?\"\n\nI've received the following responses from the program directors that have interviewed me:\n\n-\t\"Good question. I'm not sure. Let me ask HR and get back to you.\" The next day I was told \"Your interview was great and we'd love to have you, but being able to drive is considered an essential function according to HR. If a client has an emergency and needs to go to the ER or something, staff needs to be able to drive them. I'm very sorry.\"\n-\t\"Sorry. Our insurance company requires that all employees be able to drive for liability purposes.\"\n-\t\"Sorry. We require all of our employees to be able to drive. And no, it can't be another coworker with you who does the driving for you.\"\n\nOne residential treatment center for substance abuse I interviewed at back in January made my blood boil. I was told during the interview that being unable to drive wouldn't be an issue. I was offered the position – signed the offer letter, W-2, direct deposit information, employee handbook, etc and turned in all the hiring paperwork. I was then told to expect an email soon from HireRight to proceed with the background check...3 days passed and I hadn't yet received any emails. Worried, I went back to the website where I had applied for the job – and sure enough, I found the job opening for the exact same position with the exact same shift schedule and pay had been reposted. I called the treatment facility and was told that they had changed their minds, being unable to drive would unfortunately be an issue.\n\nJust today, I followed up with HR about another Residential Aide position I had applied for at a long term residential facility in California specifically for blind adults over the age of 21 with multiple disabilities who cannot live independently. It sounded like a perfect fit! I was interviewed on March 2nd about a Residential Aide position. When I explained that I'm actually legally blind myself and don't have a driver's license, the facility manager told me it wouldn't be a problem because there's plenty of other staff members that can drive if needed. She was so impressed, she offered me the position on the spot and told me that HR would be calling me shortly.\n\nUnfortunately no one ever did, and HR called me Friday morning to inform me that – yep, you guessed it – the position requires a valid driver's license. Umm...excuse me? All of the clients are blind or visually impaired themselves – so that is beyond terribly hypocritical – and it makes my blood boil even more than the last incident described above!\n\nI'm just so frustrated with all this discrimination I'm facing all because I am legally blind and cannot drive a car – all things that are not even within my control. I am well aware that the rate of employment for persons with disabilities (17.9%) is much lower than that of the general population (61.8% as of 2020), but I had never experienced first hand exactly why that is until now. I don't know what to do or who I could contact that would be able to help me with this. I'm on the verge of giving up, quite frankly – and even if my determination wasn't dwindling, there's only so many companies around the area and I'm actually running out of places to apply to!",

    "text": "You got the interview/screener, now what? Part three of how to get a job series. Omg okay so you got an interview, what do you do? This will cover in person and zoom interviews because they are both happening so that said, here we go.\n\nFirst, congratulations, this is nerve racking as hell and you don't want to mess it up, but you'll be okay I promise. Here's what you want to have ready before the phone screen:\n\n1. Cover letter\n2. Resume\n3. At least 5 questions about the company and or role\n4. A few back up questions in case they answer them during the screen\n\nAlright ladies and gents I am going to tell you something now that you are going to hate but here is the truth. Your resume at this point means absolutely nothing. Most people will hire you because they like you, your experience be damned. Why? Simple. Even me as good as I am at my role I can tell you that there are people out there that are better than me, but I have job over them right? There are a myriad of reasons for this and I will cover them. Before I get to that section I will preface this by saying that there are sociological reasons too for why people don't get jobs, I will share those with you but they will piss you off. You've been warned. Anyhow first for the screener.\n\nSo in my experience unless you are unskilled the screener is going to have no idea what the fuck you do. They will be reading from a list of things that the manager wants and you will need to answer in the affirmative. Believe or not you want a screener like this. Why? Cause your job is to impress them, how do you impress them? Through knowledge and humility, anyhow let's go through the steps.\n\n1. Research the company and generate questions from here. Make sure you understand what it is they do.\n2. Read the job posting in detail, high light any sections you want to emphasize during the screening. If it says \"highly sought after or must haves\" and you have those make as much attention as you can during the interview about them. \n3. First thing is first, when they first call take a minute or two to ask them how they are, thank them for today, and get to know them. They will report your disposition just as much as your resume. Kindness here goes further than anything else. \n4. Answer each question with zeal and examples: Did you ever drink a forklift? Why yes, I am actually licensed in using a forklift and I would say 80% of my day was based on putting away material, based on feedback from my team and my manager I was the most efficient and safest driver. \n5. Have questions for them, most times if it is skilled they can't answer them and that's okay, in those cases say \"that's okay thank you, during the next round of interviews i'll go ahead and ask the manager\". This is a sales tactic used in making yourself and them feel like you have the job.\n6. Ask about next steps and be enthusiastic. I am looking forward to next steps and meeting so and so.\n7. Make sure that you get their name and phone number and email before the convo ends, sometimes stuff ends up in spam and you forget about it, don't risk it.\n8. Most times before the convo ends the recruiter will say if you have any further questions etc. Always ask questions, even just one...\n9. When they tell you if you have further questions email. Please do, in fact use this as an opportunity to send a thank you email.\n10. Add those questions, answers, emails, all info to the \"interviewer\" folder I told you about. \n\nNow the interview is over and you may be curious (am I moving on) well here are a few taletales\n\n1. Remember the next steps question? Were they ecstatic or avoiding? Did they tell you there will be/won't be?\n2. How was the tone of the convo? Did you make them laugh? Did you keep it uplifting and positive?\n3. Did you ask questions? \n\nNow earlier I mentioned that there are sociological reasons why you make not get past the screener and here's what I mean which I will go in more detail in the next section. That said, statically for most roles unless they are deemed or considered \"gender specific\" think nurses=female, there is specific type of person who is hired. Historically it's a white male the ages of 25 and older who is at least 6 feet tall. Weird and shitty right? Well keep that in mind for when I go to the next section cause this is where it will matter.",

    "text": "Does anyone have any tips on how to move on from a traumatic work experience? I was let go from my previous job where the work environment was toxic and systemic racism was around. Even though the organization is a rather small nonprofit, every few months, it seems like someone or groups of people would be let go - and not a lot of people would know why as there were no formal performance reviews ever. Despite that, I spent a few years there building my role and outperforming quite a bit in comparison to other similar roles in other organizations. I did this working extra hours often and covering roles as needed despite not being paid for it, as going above and beyond was the norm. There was a culture of bullying where the executives would judge people on what they wore, their weight and such. They forced people to always be \"positive\" and they wanted things to be sugar coated and a culture of fake happy is promoted. This is in addition to reckless spending that everyone was supposed to be ok with.  Because of this and the fact that people were always being let go, everyone was on edge and when COVID-19 started, that made me on edge too. People started to backstab each other, like one of my direct reports started to backstab me by saying things about me to my superior - that said I have never done anything that betrayed my integrity. This way of management is hidden behind a the mission, and because of the marketing of the mission, funds keep coming in despite poor staff treatment and management. \n\nThe hardest pill to swallow is the advancement opportunities here. As a BIPOC person, I never received any advancement opportunities. However, everyone who is white seems to be advanced continuously. For example, the executive director's assistant was promoted 3 times in 2 years and despite them not having the merit or leadership abilities to really warrant a senior level position. \n\nThe day I was let go, I remember going into the office and a cab was waiting for me outside. It was a 3 minute conversation where they told me my position was eliminated for business reasons and then papers were asked of me to sign. I didn't even have a chance to say goodbye or clean up or anything. It was so traumatic. \n\nI am worried if I move into another role at another organization, I am worried about the following things:\n\n* If I moved into a similar role at another organization, how would I answer why I left?\n* What if I run into the person who takes my role after me, how would I confront them (mind you - the person before me was let go too)?\n* I feel a lot of injustice still, and lots of anger and resentment, but because I signed papers (I learned now that you have to talk to a lawyer before you sign an employment contract and after) I can't say anything to anyone. What can I do to get my justice back?\n* I can't help but blame myself and look for what I did wrong, but I know it's not me. It's just a hard pill for me to swallow.",

    "text": "I've never felt so hurt by the word \"bitch\" I've never been offended by the word \"bitch\" before, that is until today. My female friends and I jokingly call each other \"biotch\". Sometimes I yell at my phone that it's \"being a bitch\" when it isn't working. That changed today when I was filling up my car with gas.\n\nBe me, driving over to wish my little nephew a happy 12th birthday as soon as he gets out of school, but before I have to go to work for the evening. I need to stop by Target to pick up his present, but I realize that my gas tank is empty. I stop by a gas station,  pull up next to a gas pump, and start filling up my car. A man walks out of the gas station store with a wad of cash in each hand (which makes me think he just made a transaction).\n\n\"You don't even realize what you did, did you?\" he says to me as he walks towards me. I wonder, what the hell  this guy is talking about and who is he talking to. \"Yeah you, I'm talking to you. You took two lefts getting to the gas station!?\" I point at myself confused because I took a right to get into the gas station. \"Yah, you, you dumb bitch!\" As the guy gets closer, I'm getting a little freaked out. It's the day time, but I am all alone so I'm concerned. \"Okay?\" I respond, hoping that he goes away. I'm wracking my brain trying to remember if I didn't use my turn signal or wasn't slow or careful before turning right, but I don't think I did anything. I also have an older, white Honda model that's pretty common, so I think this guy might have my car confused with another. The guy starts mocking me and yelling \"You don't know how to fucking drive, bitch!\" I start to ignore him as I'm finishing filling up my tank. The guy walks over to his female friend and her car a few gas pumps over from me. He won't stop yelling about me, and at this point, I just want to get the fuck out of there so I can see my nephew.\n\nThe worst thing happens. My car alarm is on a hair trigger and starts going off. I'm driving an old model and can't afford the thousand dollars to completely change the alarm system, so I've had to put up with it.  I can't start the car, and there's someone behind me waiting to use the gas pump. I hear the guy maniacally laughing as I'm trying to get my car alarm to shut up. \"Stupid bitch!!! Doesn't even know how to use her own car!\" I start panicking because I'm just trying to leave and this asshole won't leave me alone. Another guy parked next to the jerk starts laughing along with the stranger as well and says \"That shit is funny!\". A female attendant at the gas station comes and tries to help me turn my alarm off. She's really sweet, and gets the car alarm to finally stop, but is unable to get the car started. She goes back to work in the station store after I thank her profusely. Asshole guy loudly yells \"You're going to get in a car accident and die, you fucking bitch!!!\" I wonder why the hell he's still here. I'm now trying to turn my car on without triggering the alarm again. Eventually, I get my car to start. I see the guy and his female friend waving \"goodbye\" to me as they drive away. Seriously, what an asshole. On my drive to spend my nephew's birthday with him, I start breaking down and crying. I've never felt so publicly humiliated by a total stranger. Once I get to a Target to pick up my nephew's birthday present, I call my sister, cry, and apologize for running late. I don't know why, but being called a \"dumb bitch\" really bothered me.\n\nTLDR: A crazy stranger wouldn't stop calling me a \"dumb bitch\" in public at a gas station. I've never been bothered by the word \"bitch\" before, but I felt targeted when a man started using it over and over again against me.\n\nUpdate: I did not expect this to blow up the way it did (I know, typical thing to say on Reddit). First, I want to say thank you to everyone who was encouraging and sweet in the comments. I've been busy with family and work, but I finally got to read through many of the comments. Thank you for all of the Hugz, Silver, Take my Energy, and Helpful awards. Second, thank you to everyone who gave me advice about how to fix my car alarm. When I bring my car to the repair shop, I'll ask for help to do the things you all suggested. Third, people have gone through some crazy, horrible shit from strangers, all way worse than this situation. I am so sorry that these pieces of shit decided to be assholes to you all. You are a hundred times stronger than the strangers who harassed you.\n\nExtra Update: I went back to the gas station to let the manager know that the female attendant that helped me with my car alarm was really wonderful. I also wanted to make sure that I hadn't made some obvious mistake while I was driving into the parking lot. The manager was really awesome and explained how weird her interaction was with the asshole when he came into the gas station store. He was super cheerful with her, and as soon as he saw me through the window,  his demeanor completely switched. It helps to have a little validation from people around you that you weren't the only confused person. \n\nI want to clarify that I'm not trying to cancel the word \"bitch\". I'm not offended by guys that I know using is jokingly with me. It was just so strange to hear a total stranger use it against me (you know, along with acting fucking crazy). I also want to clarify that the asshole was not an older guy. He seemed like he was my age, in his twenties. He had dreads and dressed kind of like a \"bro\". People don't have to be from older generations to be intolerant. ALSO, a lot of people have mentioned that he might have been mentally ill, and even if that were true, I know there are many people with mental illness, including myself, who would never treat someone that way. I hope this asshole gets help if he needs it, but then again, he doesn't deserve my sympathy.",

    "text": "They didn’t believe us because he was a nice looking,nerdy, professional white guy Trigger warning- stalking,violence,lewd sexual behavior  and rape ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ \n\n\nFebruary 2019 a new neighbor moved into my quiet and mainly peaceful building. James is a nice looking, nerdy, professional white guy in his early thirties. He was polite (in the beginning),has a good job and looked like a good guy. But he started to target me (27f) and Claire (30f) my neighbor. It started small with him being overly familiar and excessively friendly,to invasive small talk while waiting for the elevator,asking if I had a boyfriend, if Id share a drink with him, or if the guy that visited me was my boyfriend(then later started saying it was my baby-daddy/sugar-daddy, it was my dad and I have zero kids. He was just being racist). \n\nAt first I kept it polite but short. Then he asked me out. I let him down gently. Told him I wasn’t dating right now. Then he started saying we should be friends and invited me to parties at his. I gave him all the excuses, oh I’m working/got plans/got a headache/tired etc. Then one day he cussed me out for being a tease(I swear to all that is good I never once was interested in this man and never was anything but neighborly to him). \n\nThen I found out he was doing the same(not exactly the same cause I got a nice side dish of racism with my abuse) to our neighbor Claire who lives right next to me, who was also keeping it polite with him. After awhile he must’ve realized neither of us could be persuaded to go out with him. \n\nHe then became angry. He started slamming the doors behind him if he saw either of us approaching. He would mutter stuck up bitch or n-slur in my case. My doormat was always mysteriously wet/white-ish stuff on my door handle. Random dms calling me the n-slur/talking about the good old days/degrading racist porn being sent from blank accounts. To packages going missing. Then one day he just touched his genitals in front of me. He just put his hand down his pants and started to rub himself. Then he started to watch porn on his phone really loudly when he was near me or stood really close to me in the elevator.\n\nAfter months of this disgusting behavior. Claire and I started to complain heavily to building management of every instance of lewd behavior since the super/resident manager wasn’t of much help with our initial complaints. And these motherfuckers decided to tell him that we were the ones that had made the complaints in their meeting with him. Well that upset him alright! James’s erratic behavor became more targeted, more frequent and much scarier. It was near constant harassment and lewd behavior. He accosted me and Claire at every chance he got. He was escalating and it all started with just looking at us dirty,getting too close,muttering swear words and then it turned to sexual harassment (making sex noises, aggressively touching himself every time he saw either of us, whipping his dick out,rubbing against us), getting in our faces, breathing down our neck in the elevator just an increase of belligerent behavor.\n\nThen a few weeks ago he threatened to sexually assault me “and see if that wouldn’t loosen the stick stuck up my ass”. I knew in my soul and without a doubt that this man was going to try to hurt me. I left and went to stay with my parents. I called Claire and told her to leave as this man is out of control. She refused to leave as this was her home. Last Saturday I returned home because I was tired of staying at my parents and had hoped he had cooled down. I spoke to Claire and she told me he hadn’t bothered her in awhile. At around 6pm I decided to get some food. I returned,parked my car and started walking towards the elevators,he then chased me in our underground parking lot(I didn’t see him chase me but I heard heavy foot steps running towards me so I just ran, instinctively) As soon as the elevator doors closed I called the police and they came out a few minutes later. This was maybe the 5th time I called the police on him in the last 2 months.\n\nThey told me they couldn’t do anything since I never saw his face and that gut instinct wouldn’t be enough to accuse someone of a crime. Okay fair. They even seemed frustrated with me as if I was bothering them. I begged them to at least check with the super for any security footage. Conveniently the camera was awaiting repair’s (its been awaiting repairs for almost a year now). The police left at around 7:30/7:40pm after advising building management to deal with him since this wasn’t the first time I or Claire had reported this man for harassment and intimidation. At around midnight Claire returned from work. James was awake, he somehow snuck behind her and pushed her in as she was opening her door. He beat her and raped her. He then fell asleep. She somehow found the courage and strength to get up and sneaked herself out. She banged my door several times as it was around 5:20am and I was asleep, I was scared at first and thought it was him but when I looked through the peephole. I noticed it was a completely naked Claire and I let her in. She was really hurt. It was brutally painful just looking at her. We called the police and when they arrived he was still asleep. They arrested him. Claire was taken to the hospital and I went with her. While I was in the waiting room I had the worst panic attack of my life and had to be sedated. (I was raped when I was 22 and suffer from ptsd ever since, so it was a traumatizing night and I hadn’t slept much the night before as I was completely wired up and anxious from him chasing me earlier )  \n\nAll of this could’ve been avoided if the police, building management/property company took us seriously.\n\nINFO- using fake names and obviously Claire and I have already moved out. Claire is staying at her grandparents and I am now living at my parents.\n\nAlso I have a security camera that has recorded most of his behavior. I have written evidence of me contacting the building manager and escalating things to the management company. Emails sent to the property company that owns the building. I have recordings of James verbally abusing me,groping me,threatening me and I have recordings of my conversations with the police and building manager of every incident and they were aware I was recording them. I have video evidence of him pissing on my front door. A recording of hem smearing sperm on my door/door handle and on Claire’s door. Claire has the same recording as she also has a front door camera. From the moment we knew he was out of control we started documenting everything.",

They have a recruitment policy of interviewing 50% women, 50% men. My (male) manager has repeated this fact a few times. I'm unsure of his motivations for even sharing that info. Anyway I met my fiancé at work. He's otherwise a left-voting, kind and tolerant person. \n\nThe reason I've made this post is because I told him we're getting two new members of staff, 1 man, 1 woman, and the man is called Igor and he's from Brazil. My boyfriend's responses were \"probably a transwoman or something\". My reaction was ????? He went on to say that the woman was probably black and/or in a wheelchair.\n\nHe just said he was concerned because the way they're handling things is going to result in a lot of young white men getting frustrated at having an unfair disadvantage and it'll backfire with more prejudice, if they keep losing out to them. He didn't use the term 'woke' but it seems like that line of argument has got through to him.\n\nI asked him how a Brazilian man would be unfairly advantaged, like we don't even know his race and Brazil has very different attitudes to race anyway. So I am left wondering where did it come from, and what is the best way to help him de-radicalise.\n\nLike I say, he's otherwise extremely \"progressive\" in our relationship, extremely pleasant to people and actually finds people of other backgrounds and cultures interesting. I was wondering whether other women have found this, and how to cope with it. \n\nIt really doesn't help that we work in a very macho, old-fashioned workplace and have a manager whose actions seem to encourage the idea that women like me had a helping hand and didn't earn our place, but I don't know how to change that either.\n\nIt's making me question my future with him, but I also have to live in a society with men like this so breaking up with him won't change much generally.",

So I made an alternate account to share this story since I don't really want everyone I know to know about this. It's long, and graphic, but I need it out there.\n\nI'm 40. When I was 25 I had my first child. I had researched and thought I was well informed, I'd still argue that I was and that I had advocated for myself loudly. However, what I learned was that, when dealing with the medical community as a pregnant woman, often you're dismissed, scorned or flat out ignored. I'm in Canada, white, married, and was a \"suitable\" age to be having a child, but I was still treated as an inconvenience at best and as a total idiot far too often.\n\nAt about 20 weeks I started retaining a ton of water. My feet were also turning purple anytime I stood for long. As any concerned pregnant woman would, I went to my doctor about it. I was assured that everything was fine and that everything I was experiencing was normal. It didn't feel normal however and I brought it up again and again at every appointment only to be assured repeatedly, and with some annoyance, that everything was fine. I ballooned out, was exhausted all the time, I couldn't stand or walk for long, I was often dizzy. I figured it was *just* pregnancy. \n\nWhen I and my husband went in for my 37 week checkup, we didn't even see my doctor. Another doctor met me at the reception as I was checking in and said \"Oh, we're sending you to the hospital for an induction today.\" Shocked, I asked why and was told that I had pregnancy induced hypertension (used to be called preeclampsia) and that my blood pressure had been dangerously high and that I needed to be induced ASAP. I was stunned. How could this be, I asked, no one had told me anything about this! The doctor seemed surprised and checked my file again, she was sure, it was marked right here. I was told that I and my baby were in \"serious danger\" and that I *needed* to go straight to the hospital, no there wasn't even time for me to go home and get my bag, I'd have to get family to bring it. \n\nI left the office, broke down in the car, and my husband drove me to the hospital.\n\nI don't care to write every detail here, suffice to say it was a humiliating and painful birth experience. It took three days to have my baby. Highlights include being forced into labour with a \"balloon\" and a pitocin drip, then pushed up to nearly delivering, then \"turned down\" and \"shelved\" in a room for 24 hours until more rooms opened up and they were ready to deal with me. I was then \"turned up\" again and moved to a delivery room. I spent some time labouring in a bed in a hallway,  had countless people through the room, no one asked me if minded or even explained who they were. At one point this included a team of students there to observe. \n\nI am a loud and somewhat aggressive person and I asked lots of questions, but largely was dismissed, ignored or simply unanswered. I was given an epidural, not my choice. I was told it was medically necessary to preserve my and my baby's life. The epidural made it impossible for me to do more than sit up slightly. I wasn't able to get up, stand or walk at all. I could still feel plenty though, including when I needed to push. This wasn't surprising to me, I had a documented medical history of pain killers and freezing medications wearing off 3-4 times faster than average. The nurse argued that this wasn't  possible, that I was just \"overly anxious\". I told her I could feel the baby coming and she rolled her eyes and checked, only to see my baby's head halfway out. She told me to \"wait for the doctor!\" There was no waiting however and out my daughter came, barely caught by the nurse.\n\nShe wanted to whisk her away to another room to clean up, but I wouldn't have it and insisted she and my husband stay in the room. I was finally given my daughter and an intern doctor showed up to check me over. I was told to push once again and he pulled the placenta out with a sharp tug.\n\nDue to retaining so much water and then being hooked to a variety of drips for the last 3 days, my tissues were \"waterlogged\" and had torn quite badly when my daughter was born. The intern set to stitching me up. He told me that the damage was extensive, but not to worry, he'd \"stitch everything up nice and tight for my husband again\". I had absolutely no idea what he meant, I just assumed he was trying to be funny or something and blew it off, engaged in my daughter. \n\nEverything seemed ok and my husband, who had been by my side the entire 3 days, was exhausted and hungry and needed a bathroom. He said he'd be back in a few minutes, I said that was fine and I was left on my own.\n\nAfter a few minutes the nurse came back in and told me she needed to palpate my uterus to ensure that all the pieces of the placenta had come out. She took my daughter and placed her in a bassinet and then laid me back down and massaged my uterus. It was incredibly painful and I asked her to stop, but she insisted it was necessary and kept on. This apparently prompted me to pass a larger than acceptable piece of placenta (remember, I wasn't allowed to simply deliver the placenta, it was pulled from me). She called the intern back (I still had not seen an \"actual\" doctor) who proceeded to push at my uterus even harder and who ignored me completely, let alone my demands that he stop and explain.\n\nThen, he briefly told me that it was necessary that they get all the remaining pieces of placenta out and that I \"couldn't be feeling anything since my epidural must still be working\". I assured him that it was not, that I could feel *everything* and that I have a documented medical history of freezing and pain relievers wearing off faster than they should. He dismissed this completely and proceeded to push his entire hand up inside my uterus to manually remove any remaining bits of placenta. I screamed and demanded he stop, the nurse even told him he needed to stop, he insisted that he was \"almost done\" and kept on. After what felt like an eternity, he finished, and told me \"that wasn't so bad was it\". It was about then that my husband came back in the room. I was furious, in pain and upset and told him what had happened. Meanwhile, the nurse realized that I was bleeding. A lot. She called the intern back in and he started stitching me up, again. I had no pain killer and finally the nurse gave me nitrous oxide to inhale, only it made me violently sick. So I could choose between momentary pain relief, followed by pain and vomiting, or just enduring the pain.\n\nHowever, the bleeding wasn't stopping and finally an actual OB was called in. She was the first person to treat me like an actual person. She took one look at me and immediately began yelling at the intern. What had happened was that because of all the fluid in my tissues, when he decided to reach up inside me, he tore the skin inside my vaginal cavity in many places. I was hemorrhaging blood now. \"Shredded\" was the word she had used. The nurse asked if they should prep an emergency surgery and she said there wasn't time and ordered a team to the delivery room. She explained everything to me as she worked, she told me that she was trying to stop the bleeding by stitching the tears, but that this stitching was simply causing more tears at this point. She then told me that she was going to pack my entire vaginal cavity with gauze in the hopes that is would stop the bleeding and give me a blood transfusion. Then we would see how it went and hopefully, since I had given birth, the edema in my tissues would go down and she would be able to make repairs. So that's what she did.\n\nI spent 5 days in the hospital afterwards. The following day the packing was removed and further stitching done inside. I was encouraged to try to get up and move. When I stood up however, everything went black. It was another 2 days before I could get out of bed and have my catheter removed. I was finally discharged and sent home to recover. \n\nHealing took months. Again, my concerns about the pain and discomfort, this time with a new doctor, were dismissed repeatedly. The stitches were supposed to dissolve, but I have weird synthetic allergies and so they didn't. So 6 months post-partum, after I had finally demanded they at least look at them, an internal inspection was done which revealed a raging allergic reaction/infection and the stitches were removed over two separate sessions in hospital and I was placed on antibiotics. Finally, I healed.\n\nI figured I was finally done with all this, after a month more of healing, I was finally able to have sex again. Only, it hurt. A lot. I figured maybe things were just sensitive down there still, but it never seemed to get any less painful. I realized that some positions, ones that put more pressure or stretching on my perineum, were more painful than others. My husband said there was a wide ridge of scar tissue there and after some more intense self-exploration, I realized that what had happened was that the intern had \"stitched me up nice and tight\" alright, by sewing closed a half inch or more of my vaginal opening just above my perineum. I was beyond upset, I was furious. I made an appointment with a doctor that had some experience in this area and was told that, what I had suspected was entirely right, that it was shockingly common in women post-birth, usually they had no idea that it had been done to them until long after birth, and that I would require a surgical procedure to return things to \"normal\" and be able to have pain free sex again. However, she said, if I planned on having any more children, I might want to wait as often the birth of the second baby can fix the damage done.\n\nMy husband and I had always planned to have more children, but the first birth was...traumatic to say the least. I decided that I wanted answers for what had happened to me. So I started with my doctor who cared for me during my pregnancy. I made an appointment and met with her and asked why she hadn't told me about my condition? Why had she not informed me of my options? And why had she decided, without consulting me, that I would be induced at 37 weeks? Her answers were condescending and unsatisfactory. She told me that she had felt that it was in my best interest not to know. That first time mothers usually caused themselves more stress than necessary. She felt that, if she told me, that the stress of worrying about my condition would be worse than simply monitoring the condition herself. I asked why she had not discussed the option of medications with me, or any treatment options prior to an induction. She reiterated that telling me would cause greater problems and that she could not proscribe me a medication without telling me what it was for. I was shocked. I asked her how she felt ok with that choice? She had no idea what I was doing in my life. Only a week before going in I had been painting our nursery and had been up high on a ladder, felt dizzy and light headed, and had needed to lie down for awhile. She seemed surprised and said that she had asked me if I was working still when I had complained about the swelling, and so she assumed that I was \"taking things easy\" when she learned that I was not working. I was incredulous. I asked why she had sent me for an induction (without even being present at my appointment to discuss it with me) and she said that she had determined that was the best course of action at 20 weeks, assuming I carried that long. Afterall, delivering the baby was the \"cure\", so she figured it made the most sense to get to 37 weeks and then have the baby. I asked if we could have likely monitored my condition, tried medications to manage my blood pressure, and allowed me to go to full term and labour naturally. She said we probably could have, but why would we? I left, angrier than I had been to start, and lodged a formal complaint against her, as well as requested all my medical records from my delivery and hospital stay. \n\nWhen they arrived I was shocked to see there was absolutely no record of my having any stitching or anything. The blood transfusion was listed as \"due to extensive bleeding during delivery\" and there was no record of the name of the intern, any of the stitching done, or the 5 days I spent in hospital afterwards. My records had me listed as \"discharged\" the same day my daughter was born.\n\nI lodged formal complaints against both the hospital and my doctor (again), but nothing ever came of either of them to my knowledge. I was certainly never contacted and was dismissed as a matter of form whenever I tried to enquire. \"Someone will reach out to you if they need to.\" I was told.\n\nMy trust in the medical system was done though. We did decide to have another child (not an easy choice), and my pregnancy with him, and his birth, was followed by midwives instead. I had explained my previous experience and they took great care to explain every single thing. Every step of the way. My son was delivered at home, naturally, and with no complications, despite having the cord wrapped around his neck, his body and his arm several times. I double checked everything and was never able to take anything on faith again. I also refuse still to ever be left unattended while in medical care, for any period of time. \n\nOn the bright side, my son's birth did fix my \"husband stitch\" issue. I've been able to have pain free sex again ever since. And no one offered to stitch anything up afterwards for my husband's enjoyment.\n\nIronically, the pain from the stitching seriously impeded my, and my husband's, sex lives for more than 2 years, so it didn't even achieve what it was intended to. Because yeah, who finds it \"sexy\" when having sex with their wife causes her extreme pain?!\n\nWomen are routinely dismissed and abused within the medical system. So much of what happened to me was so clearly a result of a \"I'm the medical person, I know best and this is what needs to be done\". My opinions, my right to have knowledge about what was happening to me, my thoughts, my experience, even my own physical sensations were dismissed out of hand. My autonomy over my own body was stripped away from me in a very real, highly traumatic and painful way. I was rendered helpless and everything that happened to me happened without my consent, often while completely ignoring my saying \"no\". I was physically violated in an incredibly painful and humiliating way and it was treated as nothing more than a matter of course.\n\nI've never been able to get so much as even an acknowledgement of the reality of what happened to me. If my husband andy mom had not been there through it with me, I wouldn't have any outside validation, or belief, of what happened to me.\n\nThis is not acceptable. Women have every right to expect honest, forthright and respectful care while in the hands of the medical community.\n\nWomen have every right to expect to not be violated and traumatised while in their care.\n\nI'd like to believe this is no longer the same, that attitudes that allowed this to happen to me then aren't the same now.\n\nOnly, that's not the case. \n\nMy sister just had her first baby. \n\nAfter years of struggling with reproductive issues. Pain, heavy bleeding, cysts, etc from the time she was 12. She was told she wouldn't be able to have children, she was diagnosed with PCOS, she had her baby through a fertility clinic, but was able to carry and deliver her child herself. \n\nShe was just told she has stage 4 endometriosis. That she will never be able to have another child. That it's miraculous that she was able to have this one. That, had she just found out sooner, they could have tried various treatments, but now it's too late. She was furious. How could they say \"if only she'd gotten treatment sooner\"?! How could she have possibly been any more proactive? She has been inspected by more doctors than anyone I know, but because she was young (early 30's now) no one took her seriously. They put her on birth control, they told her \"some people just have painful periods\". Now she's demanding they remove her uterus. And still they say \"oh, but what if you want more kids?\" In one breath they tell her she can't have more children and in the next they say they don't want to remove her uterus \"just in case\". She insisted and they agreed, eventually, but only after she tries a medication that \"might\" help slow the growths. For 3 months. Medication that makes her incredibly ill. \n\nEven then, they're only agreeing to a partial hysterectomy, despite her having PCOS and having been warned for years that she will eventually need to have her ovaries out. So here she is, with a young baby and having to take medication she doesn't want, to be allowed to remove her own uterus she also doesn't want, and she's having to fight tooth and nail to just get that far, let alone the issue of leaving her ovaries with cysts inside her.\n\nNone of this is ok.\n\nWhy isn't this changing??",

    "text": "Rant: friend was bullied into breastfeeding by lactation consultants after traumatic birth A dear friend, “Vera,” and her husband just had their first baby. Like all new parents, they obsessed over every little detail to keep baby happy, healthy, and safe. They spent five years and many rounds of fertility treatment to get pregnant; they’ve had plenty of time to do their homework. She was ready for the turning over of her needs to baby … with one exception: __her hard boundary was not breastfeeding.__ For many reasons - including a past history of abuse and mental health medication she can’t take while pregnant or BFing - this was the one piece of her body and autonomy she wanted to be left alone. \n\nMuch to my surprise when I visited for the first time post birth, her house had a bunch of hastily arranged breast feeding items including a pump. Because it’s HER body, and HER choice, I didn’t bring it up. But she did. And did I get an earful. \n\nShe told me that after the traumatic birth — she lost a ton of blood and had to be rushed into surgery to save her life — she was too exhausted to argue when the lactation consultants (LC) kept appearing in her room to hound her about “Breast Is Best.” __Vera was in the hospital for five days and said that after day three she just lost the will to fight back. This is her and her husband’s account of what happened during those five days:__\n\nDAY 1: the LC wheeled in a white board with a T chart that had all smiley faces under the Breast Is Best column, and a bunch of scary things under Formula = Artificial Milk. __Apparently the LC said flippantly that the only “benefit” (and actually used her hands for the air quotes) to formula was that it catered to men who wanted to keep their wive’s breasts to themselves.__ 🤯 LC also went on a rant about the formula-industrial complex… just after providing a list of “Recommended Breast Feeding Supplies Brands!” Pretty rich coming from somebody peddling a certain brand of pumps and nipple cream. Vera was so drugged up from the surgery she said all she could manage was barely nod. Vera’s husband knew she didn’t want to breastfeed but had the stance that it’s her body, her decision — so he was looking to Vera for an SOS, which, of course, didn’t come from a woman who couldn’t even speak. Plus the swipe about husbands wanting to keep their wife’s breasts to themselves really got under his skin … so he stayed quiet. \n\nDAY 2: the LC brought in an iPad with a video of an Asian mother breastfeeding and talking about the cultural bond of breastfeeding and how it honors their family’s roots of women who breastfed babies while working in difficult conditions …. Vera and her husband are Asian. She said they knew they were being grossly manipulated but, again, were just trying to survive. So they told the LC they’d think about it and asked her to leave. \n\nDAY 3: what finally broke Vera was the moment when her husband had stepped out, and *conveniently* the nurse and LC came in WITH her crying newborn and THEY physically removed her gown to place him at her breast. Which, of course, meant he quieted down the moment he started nursing. I actually gasped at the cruelty, violation, and manipulation of that maneuver. \n\nDAY 4: the LC came in to “helpfully supervise” a breastfeeding and reiterated all the reasons why it was the best course and to share some horror stories of women who used formula. Including one about contaminated formula that resulted in infant deaths. Her tagline on that one was that you always know what’s in breastmilk but NEVER know for sure what’s in formula. \n\nDAY 5: just to add insult to injury, as she was being discharged the LC breezily came by to tell her and her husband that *she was so glad* they changed their minds and were instead going to be “responsible parents” by breastfeeding their baby. The LC actually patted her on the shoulder condescendingly. \n\n——\n\nThis couple aren’t shrinking violets or stupid people: he’s a successful prosecutor and she’s a college professor in a male dominated environment. __But the trauma and exhaustion of the birth followed by the relentless tactics of the LC just sapped their will to fight back on what’s best for mom.__ \n\nVera’s beside herself. She feels stuck and is terrified that if she stops breastfeeding that her baby — who is a *smidge* on the small side — is going to die of malnutrition or contaminated formula … or be developmentally delayed … or spout green horns and become an Ayn Rand Marxist or something. \n\n——\n\nI stayed neutral about what she should do because, again, it’s HER body. Told her I was sorry that things didn’t go according to plan and that I’m in favor of her doing whatever the hell is best for her recovery and sanity. I did tell her I thought the approach of the LC and nurses was really shitty. Left it at that. \n\n__I’ve been thinking about this for days, and I’m just mad.__ I’m mad that her doctor (who knew she didn’t want to BF) didn’t intervene. I’m mad that the hospital doesn’t have a firm policy that puts on her chart something like “Patient Not BFing” and have it be respected. I’m mad that my sweet, intelligent friend was taken advantage of at her most vulnerable moments to be bullied into doing something she didn’t want. \n\n__And I’m MOST mad that it was other women who exerted their will over her body.__ \n\nThat’s my rant of the year.",

    "text": "Broken leg hurts less than my cramps - Women’s Health, pain management, and failures of the US medical system Several weeks ago I broke my leg at home after taking a fall. I’ve never broken a bone before, so I had no real reference for that level of pain. The closest thing I could compare it to was a sprained ankle about a decade ago, but that swelled up and bruised. The leg looked perfectly fine; I just couldn’t walk on it and felt popping sensations whenever I tried. I RICEd it and used Tylenol and Advil for a couple of days until it was clear it wasn’t getting any better. At Urgent care, the X-ray showed a complicated fracture, and they sent me home with a splint and a prescription for a heroic amount of narcotic painkillers. The osteopath confirmed the break, scheduled a follow up, wrote me a note for work for the next 6 weeks, and again sent me on my way with another massive prescription for opioids. \n\nTo say I was surprised by the swift diagnosis/treatment and universal, unprompted high level of concern for pain management by the doctors would be an understatement. I’ve dealt with severe, debilitating painful cramps every month since I was 12 years old. I’ve seen OBGYNS, hormone specialists, primary care physicians, males, females…. And have never ONCE had a doctor take my pain seriously. I’ve gone to urgent care and the ER and specialists only to leave with nothing except more questions and a massive bill. I’ve been called a drug seeker by nurses when I’ve gone to the ER, white as a sheet and vomiting from pain. So over the years doctors have become aversive. I don’t go to them unless absolutely necessary, and never for something pain related. \n\nThen a couple of days ago, I got my period. My leg was throbbing, I had a huge migraine, and now the cramps were starting. I was SO excited: this is what Vicodin is MADE for! I settled into the couch, turned on some Netflix, and waited to feel pain free on my period for the first time in my life. 30 minutes later, my leg pain had disappeared and so had the migraine.. but my cramps had leveled out at a still painful half mast. And I realized, my cramps hurt more than a broken leg, or at least the pain from a broken leg is more easily managed than my period cramps. And for the last 20+ years, I’ve been expected to “try a heating pad,” “use Advil”, “try exercise!”for pain that hurts more than a literal broken bone. Every month. \n\nI’m livid. This system is fucked. For years this excruciating pain that I’m feeling has been brushed off by every professional I’ve tried to address this with as “oh honey! It’s not THAT bad. You’re just not great at handling life like everyone else.” And yet, with lower level pain, I suddenly end up with enough drugs to make Keith Richards blush? Wtf? \n\nWell, they can SEE the break on the X-ray. They can match the break to a picture in a text book which gives them set parameters on pain level and actions to take. I am suddenly worthy of pain management because they can say, “YES! I believe her story because it is validated by the physical evidence of a broken bone, and the book says that it is incredibly painful.” But “lady issues/pain” can’t always be easily matched to a picture, and even if it can, there’s no guarantee that a rigid set of symptoms will show or that the severity level of those symptoms will be consistent. \n\nThis is where the patient interview and involvement is so import. But above that, believing and trusting your patients is imperative. Believing and trusting WOMEN is imperative, to our health and our lives. It’s clear to me that responses from doctors have shaped the way I view my ability to trust my body, and I’m sure I’m not alone in this. Even knowing I couldn’t walk on my leg and that I was in excruciating pain, I waited for 3 days to see a doctor. There was no visible damage to the leg, and so I doubted the extent of the injury, ignoring the clear signs of needed medical intervention. And although I spent several days white knuckling through the pain, it was brushed off because it’s so familiar and hasn’t warranted care before. Even after learning the bone was broken I never asked for pain medication; I assumed I would be told that “it wasn’t that bad”. \n\nI clearly have some retraining of my brain to do. Women deserve quality medical treatment, we deserve for our pain to be taken seriously, and we deserve to be trusted and believed when we report symptoms. I for one will be advocating for myself a lot more now. Good luck every! *break a leg* 😂",

This has nothing to do with UTIs. Life just seems to be giving me a swirly. ✨\n\n\n\nI’m 26 and have always been the girl who got an unfortunate number of yeast infections, but have somehow managed to dodge a UTI.\n\nSo a couple of weeks, when I began feeling generally 💫unwell💫 I was confused and stressed.\n\nLoss of appetite. Nausea. Vaginal bleeding between periods (may or may not be related), severe anxiety attacks, what felt like constant period cramps, and just strange mood symptoms. I just felt…sick.\n\nWent to my doctor. She told me my cycle was probably just off. No tests. Didn’t even do an exam.\n\nCut to two days later: I cannot wait any longer because I’m thinking maybe fibroids? Cyst? And I go to the ER.\n\nThis ER was like nothing I’ve ever seen. Granted, I’m from south central LA (Compton-adjacent), so my bar for a good ER is low, because I’ve been to THAT ER. Which is not somewhere you want to be.\n\nI was in a room within 10 minutes of my arrival. I was met by the kindest doctor, a young man who immediately opened with, “I’m so sorry that you’re in pain; we are going to start you on morphine right now.”\n\nIt was like an ER of an alternate, perfect reality. This man hears my weird ass symptoms and runs a full on battery of tests.\n\nMy urine culture (?) came back monstrously bad. “Nearly every type of bacteria that could be there was there and an extremely high amount of white blood cells.” Pelvic exam. Bloodwork. Ultrasound.\n\nThis incredible doctor didn’t hesitate to make me comfortable and do the most thorough work up I’ve ever seen. \n\nThat night I finally, just in time, got traditional UTI symptoms.

    "text": "I'm a woman in construction... This is a bit of a vent so bare with me, I have a lot to say...\n\nI'm a woman and I work in construction.  I used to be strictly in construction administration, but recently was promoted to production manager.  I was promoted to production manager because I know what I'm doing, I know the industry, I know how to talk to people, and I'm good with the crews.  Basically, I was promoted because I am, in deed, good at it.  And yes, I am a woman.  I'm also a small woman and an attractive woman and I wont make apologies for that or pretend that it isn't a factor in my day to day life.  Being a small, attractive, woman has often been an asset to me so no, I'm not going to \"hide it\" or pretend it isn't a thing.  Because goodness knows, if you're a woman in construction, you at least should have the decency to be butch enough that the men aren't attracted to you.  Sorry.  It's not my problem if you can't control yourself at work... Even if, it often becomes my problem in reality...\n\n1st vent: the white conservative men who dominate my industry are ALL racist and sexist.  This isn't y the first yard I've worked on an every single construction company I have worked for has rewarded a toxic culture of verbal abuse that is usually racially or sexually/homophobically motivated.  IF any of these men AREN'T actually racist, it is impossible to tell because they ALL laugh along with the constant jokes about race and sexuality.  There is one guy who calls all the crew members \"Mexicans\" as if that's an insult and not a country.  He knows full well that NONE of them are Mexican, but they are brown so he doesn't respect them.  So he makes a point of calling them all Mexicans basically to say without saying \"Don't come at me with that we're different cultures/countries bullshit.  You're brown so I don't respect you so you're Mexicans to me.  Try to say something about it.\"  He likes to call me \"The Jew\" because I'm Jewish.  He makes comments like \"Is that Jew speak?  Let the Jew handle the money.  Is that some weird Jew custom?  Is that Jew food?\"  Like, I'm not offended by being called a Jew, but he is obviously trying to offend me.  Lord knows what he says when I'm not around.  And they all go along with it.  The crew can't talk back to him because he's higher on the food chain and everyone with any power thinks he's hilarious.\n\n2nd vent: I went to the lumber yard to pick up a unit of CDX and some guy who recognized my company vehicle asked if I was the owners wife.\n\n\"Um... No?\"\n\n\"Then what are you doing here?\"  He actually had the nerve to ask me what I was DOING there.  As if it's a private fucking club.\n\n\"Working?\"\n\n\"This is YOUR job?\"\n\n\"Um... Yeah?\"  Cue he and his counterpart literally looking me up and down and proceeding to feel very entitled to comment on my physique and \n\n\"Well, you ARE pretty fit!  You have a GREAT body!  I bet you're stronger than you look.\"  Cue me just rolling my eyes and walking away.  Like, seriously?  Is this just a thing you do to everyone or just me?\n\n3rd vent: The only men who have crossed boundaries with me have been the white conservative men.  The latinos - who are supposedly all rapists - have been nothing but respectful.  They see me driving the big rig and think it's fucking great.  The white guys make inappropriate comments to/about me all the time and one of them actually went so far as being banned from talking to me outside of email because he was sexually harrassing me in the middle of the goddamned night.  They act completely fucking shocked to see me drive the box trucks and act like I turned into a watermelon if I correctly identify a screw.  Meanwhile they all tell me to \"watch out for the Mexicans\", who are almost all Salvadorean and most of them are married and have, like, I said, been nothing but respectful.\n\nI know I chose this.  I chose to be a feminine woman in a conservative and male dominated industry.  So, may be it's my fault.  Like, I could've been a nurse or something that is more acceptable for women to do, and still probably get sexually harrassed and have to deal with assholes and fuckwads.  But, I'm not going to apologize.  There is a toxic culture of racism and sexism in this industry and me being a small attractive woman who can drive a box truck is not the problem.  The problem was already there and I love getting out of the big rig and shocking everyone in Dunn Lumber who thinks it's a private boys club.  Get used to it motherfuckers!  Women can drive box trucks and fork lifts, too motherfuckers!  Small women are mighty!  Pretty girls can be tough!  I don't have to ugly myself up to make you comfortable, I don't have to dumb myself down to make you comfortable, and being 5\"0 has never stopped me from doing ANYTHING I wanted to do.\n\nAnyways, I don't know what the answer is.  I'm just venting and I'm done now.  Thanks.",

    "text": "Creepy old men still be at it in a pandemic I was picking up a U-Haul to assist with my move a few days ago, and in the line to the other side of me was an old, white man. Said man leaned into the counter around the plexiglass barrier and leered at the young woman working behind the counter (who could have been his grand-daughter). He then had the audacity to say “You should take your mask off so I can see the rest of your face sweetheart. It’s so hard to tell if you’re actually pretty or not. You should pull your mask down now.”\n\nI gave her an immediate alarmed “girl, you need help?” look because I’ve had it with fools who bother women (especially ones who don’t respect basic safety in a Pandemic) and was ready to do whatever she needed me to, but her manager stepped in right quick with “Sir, are you asking this employee to endanger herself just so you can look at her face?” Shut the old creep up pretty fast, but the young woman was obviously rattled and I was furious at how casually this man demanded she comprise her safety just to satisfy his selfish desires. \n\nWhat is wrong with some men that they think harassing women at work and asking them to compromise their safety just to satisfy their “curiosity” is acceptable?\n\nI’ve been fuming about it for days now. It just sticks in my craw.",

    "text": "The closest call Okay this is a story that sticks with me deeply. I don't really know what would've happened but I to this day believe it was one of those moments  where I could've ended up dead with just a few seconds differnce.  \n\nYou'll need to know the set up of my apartments for this. \nEntering the complex  there's assigned parking, from the drive way entering the complex to my building its about 800 feet.  To the left of that street it's just carports that are rented out, to the right  there's assigned parking and the management office behind the parking. On the right side of the office is the only visitor parking. My building is about 300 feet from the back side of the office.   The building itself has stairs on the outside then doors to enter into the hallway on each level (it's 3 stories). Once entering the hallway there's large columns separating each side by side apartment.   I'm the first apartment to the left on the second floor. \n\nWhen I was like 19, I was working at a grocery store that closed at 10:30 pm, I didn't have a car yet. So I took the bus then walked bout a half mile home usually getting back to my apartment by 11:30 -11:45 so late. . .   I walked with one ear bud in cause I'm a skidish fuck and the music helps calm me.   Anyways normal routine  till I get  almost to my my apartment complex I see a white car going way slower than the speed limit on the main road next to me. I turn into the complex and he does too.   I didn't think much of it other than it's weird for a car to be going slow. Usually it's like dead this time of night and the cars that are out speed really bad.    I keep walking in the path I usually take along side the garages.  I look over and notice the car parked by the office in the visitor parking.  Some people park there so they don't have to pay for extra parking. . . Okay keep walking trying to zone out I'm almost home, and I hear a step. A man had gotten  out of the car and circled around the front side of the office  for some reason and now was walking parallel  to me on the side walk on the other side of the assigned spaces.   There's no buildings on this side, so why did he circle around. I promise you I wasn't thinking this deep at the time but I for some reason or another I got a really bad feeling in my gut and then an adrenaline hit. I keep my head facing forward towards my complex I'm maybe 300 feet away. . . I  look over at the guy side eyeing him without turning my head. He's staring right at me! That's it . I'm in full on panic my adrenaline  hitting like a truck, I just start sprinting forward with out warning.  Trying to run to my apartment. I can now hear him chasing after me in a full on run himself. I got the head start though. I dash up the stairs to the second floor. I knew I wouldn't be able to get my keys out in time.  I threw open the hall way door and ran to the apartment behind mine  ducked behind the column that was in between and sat as still  and quiet as I possible could holding my breath as I had just before been panting. ( There's stairs on both sides of the hall way front and back. he saw me go in but I could've gone out the other door and up or down those stairs.)Seconds later I hear the hall way door open then immediately  close, then I hear foot steps running up to the next floor.  The upper Door opens.  A few seconds go by and I hear a loud bang. Like a slaming door or someone hitting something.  The upper door then opens again and I hear foot steps down the stairs.   I give it almost a  full minute and I don't hear anything any more. . .  I quickly scramble into my apartment locking the door and look out the window. The man had returned to his car and was now driving away.  \nI was safe now alone locked up and he was gone.  \n\nHe had no business  here. I can't prove it but I swear I was moments away from being kidnapped or worse that day. He chased me   hit a wall after he couldn't find me then left. He thought I  got away. For the next 2 weeks I asked for rides home from coworkers for as long as I could impose.  And to this day it's a vivid memory  in my head.",

    "text": "My Fiancé's brother is a gross manchild Posting here because I really need to vent or I'm going to go crazy!\n\nI've been with my fiancé for 5 1/2 years but we've never spent that much time with her family until this year. Last year during covid her mum was diagnosed with incurable cancer so this year we've been visiting for 1-2 weeks every other month.\n\nI've always known her brother is a manchild and been irritated by him, but recently it's gone to a whole other level.\n\nHe's 32 years old and has always lived at home with his parents. Previously he had a long distance relationship with a woman in Cambodia that seemed to mostly involve him sending vast amounts of money to her. (My fiancé raised the fact this was a massive scam but was told she was \"heartless\" by her mum and dad). When that ended a few years ago (turned out she had a lot of western \"boyfriends\" kinda fair play to her in a way) we hoped he would finally get his shit together and move out.\n\nThat clearly hasn't happened. His parents do pretty much everything for him. I mean EVERYTHING. Bear in mind his dad is 61 and a full time carer for his dying mum. They cook all his meals, they do his laundry (and collect it from the floor of his room), they change his bedsheets, they wash his dishes, they clean the whole house including his (disgusting)bedroom. \n\nBrief rant about the bedroom. I've never been inside but he leaves the door open and you can see his clothes strewn across the floor, white stains on his desk chair and tissues all around. It makes me want to vomit thinking about it.\n\nHe also walks around the house in dirty clothes that don't fit him which means we all have to see his hairy fat belly hanging out. (No fat shaming, I am overweight and working on it. The issue is the lack of social awareness around clothes and hygiene). Despite this he brags about burning thousands of calories at the gym (sure) and is always eating protein bars or shakes.\n\nThe one thing he does is occasionally cook them a fried breakfast on weekends, which of course his mum is expected to clean up. Whenever he does the slightest thing for them he is expected to be heaped with praise.\n\nHe has worked full time in a professional good paying job for years, but what does he offer to his family? About £400 a month. That's for food, lodging and no housework required. To put that into perspective that's less than half just the rent my fiancé and I pay, forget bills and food. \n\nSo what does he do with all that money? Well instead of saving to move out (he literally could have bought a house by now) he spends it all on his car, video games and stupid \"projects\" that never come to anything (like an expensive microphone and video camera for his short lived YouTube channel). \n\nWhen we come back we work really hard to cook, clean and wash to make sure her mum can have a break (her dad can't cook) and to overall support them. We also pay for the shopping and help to pay for some meals out (normally over 50% plus tip). This includes (to my regret) having to cook for her brother who has not once offered to clear the table or help with the dishes.\n\nThis would all be somewhat tolerable if he was actually a half decent human being. But he's also a careless, misogynistic PoS.\n\nWhenever there is something he doesn't like or doesn't want to hear, regardless of how small it is, he will get angry, shout, sulk and slam doors. My fiancé has told me that her mum has said she is frightened of him.\n\nHe is also a massive misogynist. He refers to a female colleague as \"the Rottweiler\" because she has red hair is allegedly ugly (whatever the hell that even means) and \"talks too much\". When discussing my fiancé's relationship with me he compared it to their aunt and grandmother because \"whenever two women get together there is always trouble\" despite the fact my fiancé and I were perfectly happy and relaxed. He also made a joke that \"the Chinese symbol for conflict is two women under one roof\" which i challenged as untrue, sexist and racist. He said \"It is true, I know a lot about this stuff actually\" (it definitely isn't true but w/e). \n\nIn the past (thank gods not around me) he used to threatened to kill, strangle and beat my fiancé. Call her a bitch, \"a little slut\" (for going on a date) and a whore. His go to insults always seem to be gendered.\n\nWhenever challenged or questioned about his behaviour he says he can't help it and we shouldn't judge him because of his aspergers. (Aspergers isn't even a recognised diagnosis here, it's just called ASD but he insists on calling it aspergers as he claims to be \"high functioning\" and to have special \"advantages\" about his intelligence). This is just clearly untrue. \n\nFor one I work with and have worked with people with ASD. They might seem a bit odd sometimes, be a bit blunt or see things in a different way but they are fully capable of being functioning adults who manage their own lives. They can be polite at work, good at their jobs and supportive to their families. \n\nApparently his mum and dad have bought into this as whenever I or my fiancé mentions anything to her dad he says he can't help it.\n\nWhat makes this worse is the family put massive pressure on my fiancé to always be kind, emotionally forgiving and practically supportive. They expect her to do care giving tasks,  they also criticize her for having an \"attitude\" if she ever disagrees or is unhappy with her father. (Her dad is a whole other story).\n\nIt just makes me miserable to have to put up with this manchild when my fiancé and I are spending a lot of time, effort and money to travel and support her family. Plus we see him splurging cash on his boy toys when we are struggling by to get enough money for our wedding (we only want a small ceremony of like 20 people and no formal reception service, but even that is a lot of money to us).\n\nI don't get it at all. The double standard between how their expect her to act and what he gets away with is galling. Especially when her parents seem to love and appreciate him more than they do her, despite her bending over backwards for them.\n\nI honestly wish I never had to come here, but I know it's so important to my fiancé and I will always support her 100%.\n\nAnyway... rant over!\n\nFeel free to share your experiences of idiot brothers or brothers in law.\n\nMuch love xxxx\n\n\nEdit: In case it wasn't clear we are both women.",

    "text": "I’m Very Tired of Medical Discrimination I have a laundry list of medical problems that have been totally dismissed by medical professionals ever since I went to college and didn’t have a parent or significant other with me to advocate for me. \n\n1) I’ve gotten UTIs my entire life. I’ve always had issues with that system of my body, ever since I was born. A doctor didn’t listen when I told him that I needed stronger antibiotics & then when the symptoms returned, he said I was making it up in my head. I went back multiple times and was turned away each time because “there’s no way the antibiotics didn’t work.” Two months later I was in so much pain that I couldn’t move and I had a kidney infection so bad that my kidneys tried to shut down. \n\n2) I had severe pain in my hip joint. It hurt all the time, no matter what I was doing, I could barely walk some days. I went to an orthopedic surgeon and was told “it is probably just pain from ovulating.” Waited months to get an appointment elsewhere. Found out that I had completely shredded the soft tissue in my left hip & needed hip surgery at 20 years old. \n\n3) A couple months after that, I got really sick. I couldn’t keep food down, I was lethargic and could barely do daily tasks. My mother & a doctor suggested that I was pregnant. I said that wasn’t possible (long distance BF, no sex in months, regular periods), got told I was pregnant and being lazy. They brought me in for urine & blood tests. Both of which show I’m not pregnant. They take more blood and say they’ll get back to us. At this point in time I was so exhausted that I could barely move and was rapidly losing weight in a very unsafe manner. My blood tests were so godawful that at first they thought I had liver cancer. What I actually had was mono, the worst case my dr. had seen in 30 years. I was bedridden for months because my liver and spleen were so inflamed that they were at risk of rupturing if I did anything more than get up and walk to the bathroom. \n\n4) My periods were awful through high school & undergrad, I got a IUD and they got a little more manageable. But even with that, I had physical and mental symptoms that would send me spiraling into a depressive episode for the week or so before my period until my period ended (so about 2 weeks). At the same time, I also had UTI-esque symptoms that multiple doctors told me was anxiety. I finally found a DO who believed in holistic care. I told her I was tired of doctors not listening and dismissing me because I was a young woman in my early to mid 20s. We sat down and talked for a long time. When I left that office I had two diagnoses: Interstitial cystitis & PMDD. Management techniques for these conditions have improved my quality of life tenfold. \n\nIf you made it this far, thank you. I know this conversation isn’t novel or new, particularly on this sub, but it is one of the most personal to me. Something I think about often is how I’m a white woman with insurance. I can’t imagine the suffering that women of color & those without insurance endure everyday because the system doesn’t listen to them…",

    "text": "I now understand why we were attacked I remember how fucking confused I was for days and weeks and months after we were attacked out of the blue. Why? WHY? Like, there was litterally no reason, nothing to be gained. \n\nI couldn't find a reasonable explanation, the police either didn't have one or didn't care to share, my friends, family, etc the same. Zero, nada.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the time I had my dog and a fairly new foster dog with me. I took them to the dog park at around 11 am on a weekday. Most dog parks in our city are relaitvely small, fenced areas tucked between buildings or next to a playground. This, however, was a bigger one (or techincally two), in the corner of a small city park. It was basically two fenced in areas that shared a fenced side, which had a gate, so the two parts could be separated or joined.  \n\nSince this was the polar opposite of peak hours, we got to explore both parts during the same outing - one had more trees and patches of grass, the other different training/playing equipment. As we didn't have anyone else to work around, we could freely go from one side to the other, a rare treat for all of us. As we did, I left something - a leash, a toy, a roll of poop bags, I can't even remember - behind in the lower part. That was mistake #1. \n\nWe were ready to leave for home, wanting the exit from the upper part - not that it made a huge difference, and we would have happily changed plans if asked -, I just had to go back to the lower part to grab the thing. It was gonna take somewhere around 15 seconds, so I didn't recall the dogs, I left them to do the their thing in the upper part. Mistake #2.\n\nI was on my way back when I saw an older man, a young woman, and a large dog approach the outside gate of the upper park. The man opened the gate without hesitation and started to enter, woman and dog trailing a few paces behind.\n\nFor context, it is customary to ask the people who are inside if it's okay to enter (if you don't know them and don't have a pre-existing relationship between the dogs). \n\nAt the time, the foster is not yet super comfortable in this new life, and mine has issues with intact male dogs, especially large ones, so I did need to consult with him and learn about his dog before we let the dogs meet, and I definitely needed to be closer to supvise them. \n\nSo I shouted - as in spoke in a loud voice from a good few meters away; didn't yell, didn't cuss, didn't do ANYTHING even midly questionable or inappropriate -, to \"please wait, don't come in\" while visibly picking up my speed. The man retreated, I started to recall the dogs, and in a split second he yelled \"YOU FUCKING BITCH\" threw the gate open again and started charging at me and my dogs. He pulled some sort of mace from his jacked while calling me a variety of misogynistic terms. I scrambled to get both dogs - one is a new foster, how fun! -, realizing I won't have time to mess around with clasps and just grabbing them by the collar pulling them away, trying to protect their and my own face from the spray. He tried to punch me in the face as I leand towards one of the dogs, and I fully believe would have if I didn't turn my head just in time. \n\nI started yelling for help at some point throughout all this, dunno what I was saying, I just remember thinking WHAT THE FUCK WHAT THE FUCK BROAD DAYLIGHT, WHAT. \n\nThe only good thing that day was that there was construction going on a bit further down the park, and a few guys must have started approaching us quickly, because two of them were entering from the lower part by the time I was dragging both dogs by the collar. \n\nSince I wasn't alone anymore, the man turned around and left with his companions. He was gone within seconds. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI called the police, they took a statement, asked the guys who helped us and they corroborated my absolutely batshit story. Since *I* didn't get any mace in my eyes and he never made physical contact with me they had nothing to charge him with. My dog did get a good amount in his eyes, luckily there was no long term damage, we just had to manage a few days of eye drops, but that didn't matter.\n\nI could have chosen to personally take him to court, thus providing him access to all of my personal data. My address. Presumably just a few streets from him.  \nI chose not to. There was this definitely insane man, charging us for no fucking reason at all, in the middle of the fucking city in the fucking middle of the day, I didn't risk learning about his methods of retaliation. Even if I did get something out if it in a lengthy process (slim chance), even if retaliation would have provided me with further proof, it's too fucking easy to poison or otherwise hurt a dog. And while at the time I felt shitty about \"not having the guts\" to take him to court, I now know that this isn't a personal failure, it's a systematic one; I should have been able to do so without risking my dog's  or my safety. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point of my rambling? \n\nI now understand. I *did* fucking do something. I *did* get him riled up. *I,* a young woman, dared to tell him what (not) to do. *I* dared to think I can limit his freedom (for what would have been a whole 30 seconds).   \nHis White Adult Male ass wasn't gonna be commanded by a 20-something little girl.   \nNever in his life did anyone try that shit on him, or if they did, they had to learn a lesson. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the time, I had no clue. It was just so-sooo random. I can't remember how many times, as I shared with friends & family I got the question at the end \"soo, but... you didn't do anything, like... anything?\", geniunely fishing for more info that would make it make sense, despite knowing me and knowing I've never run around starting fights. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince then I've learned a lot, grown a lot, read tons of personal stories, discovered literature and media dealing with the subject, in part thanks to this sub - hence my post here. \n\nNot sure what I'm expecting from this, but it sure as hell felt good to come back to this incident with a more mature understanding, and not placing any misguided blame on myself.   \n(Inspired by [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ob5gdx/woman_attacked_in_swimming_pool_after_overtaking/).)",

    "text": "I think I might get murdered at work? So…I just started a restaurant job making salads and desserts in the back. It's a perfect job for me, the hours are short and flexible, it's super easy and non-stressful, my manager is so sweet and everyone else is a joy to be around. Except for one of the cooks. I'll call him Vani for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just started this job three weeks ago. On my first day the owner introduced me to everyone and I started my work. Everyone was kind and patient with me. At one point I had to put away a dish that was through the cooks station, so I handed it to one of the cooks, Vani, to put it away because I didn't want to get in his way. He just stared at me, frowning, until I asked him politely to take it, which he did reluctantly. At this, the other cook just smiled and said \"Don't let him scare you off, he's always like that.\" I wasn't bothered by this interaction, some people are just like that and I don't take things personally. I was determined to treat this guy like any of my other coworkers, because I try to give everyone respect until I feel as though they have rightfully lost it. That same day when I was making a dessert, he passed behind me and in a deep, gargled voice said \"Run.\" I thought he was trying to get a rise out of me and I shrugged it off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the second day when he saw me, he said \"You came back, I told you to run.\" I replied, \"But I like you guys,\" to which he shrugged and said, \"You're loss.\" Later I asked \"How are you doing?\" he said he was feeling homicidal and wanted to murder everybody. Of course everyone says this as a joke, people have dark senses of humor, but he didn't say it in a joking manner at all. So, I thought that he actually might dislike people and said this just to be extreme.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy interactions with Vani are limited. I see him at the beginning of my shift and greet him. He clearly tries to get a rise out of me. He sometimes comes into my work station to get something, in which case he always, *always* cusses really loud right behind me. I hear glimpses of him calling people a \"Fucker,\" or a \"R\\*tard.\" At one point I heard him directly cuss me out, saying \"This little fucker\" as he collected a dish that I had put in the wrong place. He looked at me as he said this. This doesn't really get to me, I don't give a damn about what this guy thinks about me. He might be a bit of an ass but whatever, I can deal with that. I continue to believe that he just wants to have a little fun freaking out 'the new girl'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt one point I pointed out his DC shirt and that was the first time we had a nice conversation. We both agreed that Marvel movies are just \"two hours of bland action\" and he remarked on how he approved of how DC went in a more dark, trauma related direction. I assumed he was talking about the new Joker movie. I can vibe with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut at my last shift, I jokingly asked him \"So do you feel like murdering everyone today?\" and the way he replied, \"if you really must know, yes,\" scared me for the first time. He sounded serious, so I asked \"do you really hate working here?\" He just looked at me and nodded, and I asked, \"So why do you work here then?\" at this, for some reason he gave a creepy laugh and I walked away. Shortly after he called out to me, \"Don't worry, I only have one week left.\"\n\nI assume he means that he's quitting, not that he's planning on murdering everyone in a week. But it's been on my mind even at home and I'm a little on edge to go back to work now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's one detail that makes this situation a bit touchy. He's a black man, and I'm a young white woman. I keep trying to check myself, would I actually be nervous if this man were white? I think I would, but implicate bias is real. I know his behavior is out of line for anybody, but the fact that he is black makes me not want to go to my manager about this. Also I don't want to escalate the situation. If I talk to my manager, she will likely talk to him, and the situation might get worse. I don't want to make him lose his job. Also if he actually has homicidal thoughts, this could make things way worse, right? He's either just an ass or he clearly needs help, but I have no idea what to do about that.\n\nI keep thinking, what if he does actually want to murder everyone and he's only telling me because I'm the 'new, naïve white girl.'\n\nI will say that he doesn't give off \"creeper vibes,\" he just seems like he hates everyone and he hates his life. He hardly ever smiles and he goes about everything with an air of distain for the world. I honestly feel bad for the guy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I don't have another shift for another couple days. I'm going to ask my manager if Vani is quitting, and if she says no, I will ask Vani what he meant by \"only having another week.\" I think I will straight up ask him if I should be concerned for my life. If he doesn't give me a straight answer, I think I will talk to my manager and consider quitting my job. I don't want to be going to work wondering if it's my last day, even if it is a joke.\n\nAm I taking this too seriously? Am I being racist? Any advice or insight would be great.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Edit\\]\n\nSo I haven't been murdered yet, thankfully. Vani took an offer at a different restaurant and left, as he said. I talked to my manager before he left, though, and let her know my concern. She took me seriously and gave me the rest of the week off until he left. But I had to go back in to grab something and I ran into Vani again. He apologized to me and said that he \"has a dark sense of humor and likes to make people laugh.\" So he was definitely hazing me whether that was his intention or not. Anyway, the owner later talked to me and apologized for his behavior, saying that he talked to Vani and everyone else individually to see if they had any issues. Like I thought, looks like I was the only one being targeted.\n\nThe owner said something very annoying, though. He told me that he understood that I came form a more \"conservative background\" (he knows of my very conservative mother but knows nothing about me or my past), so he \"understood\" why I got scared and and that \"some people come from darker upbringings\". He also told me that he doesn't normally let people cuss at work, as if that was the issue. It felt condescending, the way he said that, and I realized that this is how women are taught to suppress their gut feelings. Some men like to push us until we are uncomfortable, and then people tell us that we were over reacting.\n\nThis was a learning experience for me, thank you guys for helping me through it!",

    "text": "Rattled about a thwarted SA in retail FYI: I am a 30+ AFAB. \n\nBackground: I am a closing employee for a pet-supply chain. I am usually one of two or three people closing including a manager. Tonight it was just the two of us, manager and I, we can usually hold things down 3 hours from close. Sorry for the ramble. Still organizing my thoughts\n\nStorytime:\n\nIt happened tonight. A customer comes in. No mask, male, wearing a 'Protect and Serve'/Freedom Flag underarmor shirt. Army green. Kinda skeevey. Young 25-30 white male with the scraggly beard-thing. Pretty typical of our county. Starts chatting me up as I'm closing down animals about 45 minutes to close. Comments on chameleons, ferrets, and offers up too much personal info. Asks when we close which I tell him, because y'know: Customer service. Let him know it's about a half-hour to close. Asks me more about the ferrets and then, asks if I'm single. I ask, 'Why?' he says he's just wondering. I reply with 'It's none of your business.'\n\nLatch animals closed and wander up front to my manager on register as Odd-Guy is now obviously pretending to look around. I whisper, 'That guy is giving me a bad vibe.' He nods, and asks me to shut lights off on fish.  Guy follows me to the goldfish tank, manager is eyeing him. Odd-Guy asks about the goldfish and such. Then manager approaches and asks me to go to the back to clean out food dishes and the animal cart in back. I skedaddle to the back. \n\nOn my way back, one of my favorite customers (FC) stops me (I usually sell him fish, he loves his fish tanks!) and asks if I'll help him and his young son with fish. Regretfully I let him know that my manager is sending me to the back because I had a bad vibe off of Odd-Guy.  He nods and says, 'Oh... well, I'll just have to have a chat with him/Odd-Guy then.' \n\nI head into the animal care room, start cleaning dishes and reflecting. I felt, rattled. Not unsafe. Just rattled. Felt like I was second-guessing my assessment. Finish up washing animal-dishes. I head back out as it is now closing and  I wander up front to see the Odd-Guy getting scared out the front doors. \n\n[Edit: Clarification] Apparently this is what happened as I was away.\n\nOdd-Guy was waiting outside and then went back into the foyer as we were closing and I had disappeared. FC goes outside to have a chat with Odd-Guy as manager finished up with a customer at register.\n\nTurns out my favorite fish customer is government. Field office government. Of the type you don't want to mess with or you'll end up on a watch-list. \n\nHe showed his badge, casually asked if the Odd-Guy had handcuffs on him. Odd-Guy denied then admitted to having cuffs on his person. Asked what he was going to do with those, he said he was waiting for his girl and vaguely pointed out the door. FC asks if Odd-Guy is a policeman, ex-military, etc. then adds that it is unlawful to carry cuffs and can result in kidnapping or assault charges. Essentially Favorite Customer gave him enough of a scare he high-tailed it out of there as FC takes a picture of his license-plate and we have him on camera. [End of manager and FC scaring Odd-Guy away]\n\nI come out and give FC a big dumb hug because HOLY MOLY. I grab FC's fish, plants, and give him the employee discount. \n\nI was so relieved that I trusted myself. I am so relieved my manager believed me. I am so relieved I had a friend in my corner that I didn't even know was in my corner. Both my manager and FC did the right thing and I am so thankful for them.\n\nBoth my manager and FC + kiddo walked me out to my car. FC promised to give me a call if he learned anything because he can do some info-searching due to the high possibility of an SA attempt and that the Odd-Guy was carrying cuffs and was not part of a government outfit.\n\n\ntl;dr Creepy male customer gets too personal, gives off a bad vibe.  Find out one of my usual customer's is a government agent and scares the creep off with my manager.\n\n[Update: FC got back to me about the license plate and asked if I had been bothered again. License plate came back with nothing weird to report.]",

    "text": "For anyone struggling with impostor syndrome This time last year, I was a very green software engineer at a well known tech company. I was drowning in imposter syndrome, still a bit in shock that I'd ever gotten hired in the first place.\n\nDespite this, I worked up the courage to tell my mentor at the time that I was targeting a promotion in the near future. I knew it was a pretty big stretch, but I also knew the only way to have a chance at all was to ask for the support needed to get there.\n\nI will never forget her response. With a degree of certitude typically reserved for white men in this industry, she said: \"Good!\"\n\nThis response completely changed how I viewed the mentor/mentee relationship. OF COURSE it was good that I was ambitious! Why wouldn't it be? \n\nShe was an incredible mentor and I got the promo, which of course made her look good too. So I was not at all surprised a few months later to see her get promoted and become my manager. \n\nA few months back, we were discussing which project I'd work on next, and she asked if I'd rather work on X or Y. I asked if, hypothetically, I wanted another promo, what she'd recommend. She told me in that case, I should be the leader of both. I said, do you think I can do that? And her response was just as epic: \"I have a lot of confidence in you.\"\n\nAnd this response made me realize something else. Even the most supportive manager can't read your mind. They don't know what your goals are unless you tell them.\n\nNow in both cases, I earned those promotions through hard work, building good relationships, and leveraging my strengths. So this is not to suggest that it's so easy as just asking. We all know that's not how it works. But if you don't ask, then it's really hard for you to know whether you're meeting whatever criteria are in place. And it's just as hard for your manager to know how they can support you in meeting your career goals.\n\nI'm sharing this to maybe help shush that little voice that so many of us have in our heads. The one that says, who do you think you are asking for a promotion? Or, you haven't been in your job even a year yet, you're so entitled! Or maybe, you don't know half of what all these other people know, you have no business thinking you could lead anyone!\n\nDon't listen to that little voice. Instead, start a conversation with your manager. Here are some conversation starters that I hope can help some folks.\n\n\\- I'm eager to grow in my career. What could I do to help myself prepare for the next level?\n\n\\- I'd really like to reach X level in Y time. Can you help me make a plan to get there?\n\n\\- What are some skills needed for the next level that you don't see me demonstrating today?\n\n\\- X (internal) position is open and I'm really interested. What can I do to maximize my chances of getting the role?",

    "text": "The USA's Status Quo Has Got To Go (And How You Can Bring Change) This is a message written to every physician, nurse, aide, tech, and (most importantly), patient.\n\n**TL;DR:** While practicing medicine in the US may equip you with some of the most advanced technologies and treatments available, there are a number of barriers that render these advances inaccessible to many of our patients.  I'm going to try to outline some of these areas of weakness, and close by summarizing steps we can take to fix our system *for our patients.* Change is going to take all of us.\n\n# High Cost But Poor Value: The US Healthcare System Today\n\nOur patients experience insufficient access to care.\n\n[The US spends a much higher percentage of its gross domestic product (GDP) on health care than other wealthy countries](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-271.html).  However, the US performs poorly on many quality measures compared to other countries, including avoidable hospitalizations and deaths.  Why practice medicine, if we can't *get access* to help our patients?\n\n On a per capita basis, the U.S. spends more than double the $3,453 average of all OECD countries.\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.dpeaflcio.org\\/factsheets\\/the-us-health-care-system-an-international-perspective](https://preview.redd.it/wi3ii0hlvle71.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=28b7b0793319f64994e52338060e34834c3157e9)\n\n[**Health care access, quality, cost, and outcomes vary** between different regions and states within the US.](https://www.medicare.gov/)  For example, [12 states did not expand their Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act of 2010](https://www.medicaid.gov/), creating a coverage gap for people in these states who do not qualify for either Medicaid or subsidies with the purchase of private health insurance. Further, [prices for an identical health care service can vary dramatically by region](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Healthcare-Financial-Management-Seventh/dp/1567937063). (Read about this USA Today article on the same care in [different states](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/01/health-exchange-prices/3797039/), as an example). There is [no universal health care coverage](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/international-health-policy-center/system-features/how-does-universal-health-coverage-work), and a [significant number of individuals do not have health insurance](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/pdf/265041/trends-in-the-us-uninsured.pdf). This disparity causes [earlier onset of illness, more severe disease, poorer quality of care, and a significantly reduced lifespan in those affected by poor social determinants of health.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425844/)\n\n# [Overall quality of care, by state, 2014-2015](https://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/nhqrdr/nhqdr16/overview.html)\n\n[ Some states in the Midwest \\(Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Wisconsin\\) and some in the Northeast \\(Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island\\) had the highest overall quality scores. Scores were based on the number of measures that were better, same, or worse than the national average for each measure. Many Southern and Southwestern states \\(Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia\\), several Western states \\(Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming\\), and one Midwestern state \\(Indiana\\) had the lowest overall quality scores.](https://preview.redd.it/cebbev6esle71.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fc8ec5045f8f8874cf462a1083d189f5cc8ce32)\n\n# [Average differences in quality of care for Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians compared with Whites, by state, 2014-2015](https://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/nhqrdr/nhqdr16/overview.html)\n\n[ Some Western and Midwestern states \\(Idaho, Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming and several Southern states \\(Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia\\) had the fewest racial and ethnic disparities overall. Several Northeastern states \\(Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania\\), some Midwestern states \\(Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin\\), one Southern state \\(North Carolina\\), one Southwestern state \\(Texas\\), and one Western state \\(Arizona\\) had the most racial and ethnic disparities overall.](https://preview.redd.it/giujjwfssle71.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6e0b7d0d79caec7788ef9565f9a2681ec2cf139)\n\nAccording to the [US Census Bureau reports](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-271.pdf) published in September 2020, 8% (26.1 million) of Americans did not have health insurance during 2019. 92% of Americans had health insurance coverage during 2019 (68% via private insurance, and 34.1% via public insurance). Now, [around 30 million people in the US remain uninsured](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/). Many more are underinsured, with [half of US adults reporting having delayed or skipped medical care due to costs.](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/)  Why? Well, for example... The average cost of an inpatient admission was [$25,000 in 2018](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/global-payments-to-health-providers.aspx). Common and essential drugs, such as insulin and epinephrine autoinjectors, can cost hundreds of dollars each. [Drug prices in the U.S. are twice as high as in other countries](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/prescription-drug-prices-in-the-u-s-are-twice-as-high-heres-why). Experts say brand-name drugs are the main driver of higher prices, and note that actual out-of-pocket costs is difficult to gauge. (This is beyond the scope of today's post).\n\n[ In 2015, the U.S. spent $325 billion on retail prescription drugs, equivalent to 1.8&#37; of GDP, or 10&#37; of total national health expenditures. Spending has grown considerably since the 1980s ](https://preview.redd.it/6hvld691tle71.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0da12f78ca2b33d95765e3d8da63099514c09e9)\n\n[The U.S. spends substantially more per capita than other countries. According to the OECD, the U.S. spent $1,112 on retail pharmaceuticals per person in 2014, while the next highest spender was Canada, at $772, followed by Germany at $741 and France at $659. ](https://preview.redd.it/hbb2lhh2tle71.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba1ef0ad5d392620caa5749cd09dcb2adcee6c0)\n\n[Source](https://www.bruegel.org/2017/08/the-issue-of-u-s-prescription-drug-prices/) \n\nPolicymakers aren't going to require changes without pressure from a coordinated movement.  You can use the [social determinants of health](https://www.cdc.gov/socialdeterminants/index.htm) as an example of how our system is failing. These political, cultural, and socioeconomic conditions into which individuals are born and with which they live impact health.  We have found that one's education, the environment, nutrition, wealth distribution, gender, race, and/or access to health care [are not very well addressed in the current system](https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/welcome-ad?toURL=/clinical-care/5-ways-healthcare-organizations-can-address-social-determinants-health). Do you know anyone affected by any of these?\n\n# The US population has a higher chronic disease burden than other 1st world countries, yet spends more money than other countries\n\n[https:\\/\\/mpkb.org\\/home\\/pathogenesis\\/epidemiology](https://preview.redd.it/dvmyxaixule71.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d943fec8695a704a17c6c7bb728e165320cecb0)\n\nHow embarrassing! US politicians, health care administrators, and investors are failing us. Most would argue that a just and equitable health care system benefits a society as a whole.  You can measure that by looking at chronic disease burden. How are we doing? \n\n[28% of US adults report](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-271.html) having been diagnosed with two or more chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) in their life, compared to an average of 18% of adults in other wealthy countries.  [This is a huge red flag about a failing system, but the causes are beyond the scope of today's post (you can read more about them here).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5876976/)\n\n[https:\\/\\/mpkb.org\\/home\\/pathogenesis\\/epidemiology](https://preview.redd.it/txbpns0evle71.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfa73dd0f49a3f8b08051eac456ad91c5ac19920)\n\nA just and equitable system ensures certain standards of public health that, in turn, [reduce the burden of disease on the entire population.](https://health.usnews.com/health-care/for-better/articles/the-case-for-universal-health-care) (This is [how universal health care pays for itself](https://www.healthcare-now.org/blog/how-single-payer-health-care-pays-for-itself/)). Accordingly, a health care system should strive to provide access and treatment to all population groups regardless of identity and socioeconomic status, while ensuring that underprivileged groups are not ignored.\n\nRecognizing and addressing inequalities due to social health determinants can improve the health of the most vulnerable and at-risk groups. For example, [social justice](https://www.apha.org/what-is-public-health/generation-public-health/our-work/social-justice) in health care is the delivery of high-quality and fair treatment, regardless of an individual's age, race, ethnicity, economic status, disability, or sexual orientation.\n\n# What can be done about all of this?\n\nThe most important step is to learn how our system (and specifically it's failings) are influencing the health of our patients.  We must acknowledge and address our role in changing it.  We need to look at how other countries allocate resources in ways that benefit more people (e.g., set up a budget inclusive of underserved populations). We need to provide training to ensure health care providers are culturally competent and advocate for patient rights.  We also need to create diverse care delivery models.\n\n# It starts with each of us.\n\n**You can** help fix the illogical things the USA is doing in medicine, medical education, and healthcare policy without sacrificing as much as you think. Where to start? Talk to each other. Share your goals, struggles, and challenges. Join together. Drop the poisonous attitudes, the fights, and the competition. Smell the roses. It just takes some common sense, optimism, communication, and compromise. It takes all of us working for our patients.\n\n**Today, I'm hoping to encourage all of you to** seek progress. We need to acknowledge this responsibility before things worsen. Perhaps you're discouraged, isolated, and overworked. You're not alone. We are waiting for others to fix medicine, but it's got to be us.  The status quo has got to go. How will you stand up to it?\n\n[Healthcare workers \\(and our patients\\) need to get more active in politics. ](https://preview.redd.it/c71gv3x4sle71.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f3e7ca0da93541a075af89a3210db36b8ccd43e)",

    "text": "Tasmanian Devil delivers a breech baby vaginally, and I lived to tell about it. I have to tell you guys this story, cause I can’t even believe it myself.  It's long as fuck.  Cheers.\n\n\n\nFor you in the OB world: tonight my meth-addled patient involuntarily pushed out a frank breech baby under conscious sedation. If none of that makes sense to you, keep reading, dear Redditor: it will.\n\nIn my 16 years as an L&D nurse, this night takes the cake.\n\n\n\nSo, coming on at 7pm it’s a little busy, but we don’t exactly need roller-skates yet…. I get report from Nurse 6th-Shift that there’s a patient coming up from ED. She presented to the ED with abdominal pain two days ago. They took one look at her mental health history (schizophrenia) and apparently decided that everything that came out of her mouth would be lies. She told them she was 37 weeks pregnant. So they did a chest x-ray, and an ultrasound that showed she was 33 weeks pregnant and then discharges her schizophrenic ass to the street.\n\n2 days later, she shows up back in the ED, and in the interim, she’s managed to find enough methamphetamine to blast her into florid mania. My report from 6th-Shift was “well, in the same 3 minutes she told me she is the Queen of Hawaii, an attorney, and that her parents owned the hospital.” Also, that her baby is alive, and that her mania turns into belligerent violence about every 5-7 minutes.\n\n“I told the ED doc that I can’t tell whether she’s in preterm labor or not because she tried to punch me.  I told them she should probably come up to L&amp;amp;amp;D so we can figure it out.” After 2.5 hours of this patient raising holy hell in the ED, they joyfully but slowly bring her up to us.  Excellent call, Nurse 6th-Shift.\n\nSpoiler alert: the patient delivered 2 hours later.\n\nTo my endless delight, the one thing that the ED doc did correctly in this situation was to order 2 mg PO Ativan, and 5mg IM Haldol. Bless his heart, he couldn’t figure out to send her up to L&amp;amp;amp;D for evaluation of her abdominal pain, but he sure as fuck could snow her for us.\n\nGood man.\n\nShe arrives curled up and filthy on a stretcher.  She is somnolent, but cooperative enough that we’re able to herd her onto the labor bed.  Just after the exasperated ED nurse leaves, the patient suddenly becomes very animated. “I gotta PISS!!!!” Writhing in the bed, clutching her belly: she is the very picture of labor. I put a hand on her rock-hard abdomen and my stomach drops to my knees.  At this point, all I know is: she had an ultrasound 2 days ago that put her at 33 weeks. In the 2 minutes since I met her, I am certain: she is going to deliver a preterm baby very soon.   Our one-bed well-baby nursery is woefully unprepared to care for a 33 weeker.\n\n60 seconds later, her contraction ends and she is snoring again (bless that man).  I swallow my moral outrage at checking an unconscious woman’s cervix, and find her to be 4cm dilated.\n\nAnd, fucking breech.\n\n(For those of you outside the OB world: Breech babies are NOT born vaginally. The risk of head entrapment is terrifying: the head is the biggest part of a baby’s body. This can quickly turn into dead baby hanging out of a vagina and that’s not a good look on anyone. So, any baby who is breech is universally born by c-section.)\n\nWhere were we?  Oh yeah: 33 weeks, breech, and psychotic with contractions.\n\nAs I jump up off the bed to start sounding the alarms, I see I now have a handful of meconium.\n\nNot meconium-stained fluid… Frank meconium. From a frank breech baby who is now pooping into its mother’s vagina.\n\nNow the score is up to: meth-induced preterm labor, breech, and meconium. This is the worst hat trick in the OB world. Fuck my life.\n\nSo, we start making plans to ship her out.  We gotta transport this train wreck to a facility that can care for a preterm baby.\n\nI call the community on-call Dr. LaLa to report our hat trick, and after her telling me 8 different ways that we just need to c-section her and ship the baby, I say “well, why don’t you (STOP FUCKING TALKING AND) head in here, and we’ll have some more information when you get here.\n\nIn the background, volume 10: “I GOTTA PISS!!!!” I run back into the room to keep the patient from tearing her IV out as she barrels for the bathroom like a bull with its balls in a pinch. I also discover that she is dribbling copious amounts of undiluted meconium down her legs, has wiped it on the siderail, and has generally made a baby-poo finger painting out of everyone and everything in the room. Pretty sure I have some in my hair.\n\nBy the time Dr. LaLa waltzes in, it is clear to everyone on the unit that not only is this lady not going to stay pregnant long enough to make it to the helicopter, she isn’t going to stay pregnant long enough to make it into surgery. Also, she is almost completely unresponsive in between contractions and definitely cannot consent to surgery. Once Dr. LaLa catches up to speed on the very real mess that we’re all in, she says “Call Dr. Crusty, whatever happens - he can help.”\n\nOh great.   Good old Dr. Crusty. (we’ll get to how he earned that name later.)\n\nDr. Crusty has two states of being:\n\n1. Look up the word “doddering” in the dictionary. His grinning face is the damn centerfold. It would be cute, if he wasn’t a surgeon. He dodders at everything. Walking, dictation, perineal repair, sharp dissection… I’ve seen him lacerate two babies’ faces in c-sections and yet still he is somehow in practice.  The OR techs give him the biggest needles they can find because he can't see the smaller ones.  He has a legit parkinsonian shuffle.  I could go on for days...\n2. His other mode is: \"8 SEMI-CONFLICTING ORDERS AT ONCE! JESUS CHRIST YOU INCOMPETENT NITWITS MOVE FASTER!\" His trauma response is to become consummate prick with snide, passive-aggressive remarks about our nursing skills that everyone just lets slide because he’s delivered most of this rural area’s babies for the last 40 years.  He reminds us, constantly, how much experience he has, and how good he is at doctoring.  That said, he is actually amazing at some stuff, and will accept chickens and lawnmowing in payment for his services, so I am conflicted about talking shit about him.\n\nBack to the scene:\n\nWe rush back to the operating room, and I scoop her onto the OR table between her wild contractions. Every 4 minutes, she becomes the Tasmanian Devil: writhing, howling, and grunting. I half-sprawl my body across hers to keep this tornado of a person from whirling right off onto the floor. Once one particular 60-second storm subsides - my dearest and actual most favorite anesthesiologist Dr. Diamond Rainbow pushes her mystical white light elixir of the gods into Taz’s IV.\n\nWe all felt a warm balm wash over us as the propofol solved quite a few of our problems.\n\nWith the Whirling Dervish asleep, we could turn our attention to more pressing things, like the half a baby butt peeking through this lady’s labia. (It was a girl, BTW. It was labia in labia. Labiaception for a minute.)\n\nI love Dr. Diamond Rainbow with every fiber of my little nurse heart. She somehow waved her magic wand and settled this patient into a sweet peaceful place: somewhere between methamphetamine, Ativan, Haldol, Propofol, Versed, and Fentanyl…a delightful rainbow of medications…  Taz was able to sleep soundly, but keep her reflexes intact.\n\nMaintaining just enough anesthesia for our Tasmanian Queen of Hawaii to protect her airway... meant she also retained the Ferguson Reflex.\n\nFor those of you who’ve never pushed a baby out: you know that feeling you get when you take a satisfying shit, your face contorts a little and your body goes into an animal hrrrrrrrrnnnggggg… and then you eject a pound and half of yesterday’s tacos? Yeah, that’s actually a reflex.  When you have a 5lb 10oz baby far enough down in your pelvis, your body knows just what to do with it.\n\nYeetus.  That.  Fetus.\n\nSo, the patient slept, and every 3 minutes would push quite effectively. I got to watch Dr. Crusty coach Dr. LaLa through a really lovely breech delivery. Out of hundreds of deliveries I’ve attended in 16 years as an L&D nurse - this is the third breech extraction I have ever witnessed.  Hat trick turned Triple Crown.  I felt like I was witnessing history, with that posterior shoulder delivery.\n\nOh yeah, back to Dr. Crusty.\n\nI’m tucked in against the patient’s hip, feeling her belly for contractions with one hand, and searching with the doppler for heart tones with the other, when Dr. Crusty yells out “Puje!!! Puje!!!” Which is Spanish for “push”. Not only is the patient unconscious, she is Hawaiian, not hispanic. I turn to glare at him over the patient’s draped leg, and see through his goggles that he hasn’t wiped last night’s sleep crust off his face. I catch his squinting, yellow-crusted gaze and mumble “she can’t hear you, Dr. Crusty. And she doesn’t speak Spanish.”\n\nAll’s well that ends well - the baby is fine, actually 37 weeks. The patient slept it all off and then ate everything in the fridge. CPS will be in later today to take her baby (also meth+ on Utox) to foster care, but for now she gets to coo and giggle at her cute little daughter. I took her an 8th cup of coffee before I left, with 6 sugars and 4 creamers, just the way she likes it.\n\n\n\nTL,DR: If a pregnant woman tells you she hurts anywhere between her nipples and her knees… it doesn’t matter how batshit insane she is.  Assume she is in labor, until proven otherwise.\n\n\nEdit: well this blew up.  Thanks for all the encouragement, guys.  I’ll keep writing if you keep laughing.  And, for the love, quit paying for fucking Reddit awards.  God bless /u/spez, but that dude doesn’t need your hard-earned money any more than I do.  Go donate $5 to The Bail Project.  If you PM me about it, I’ll send you a book when I’m done with it.",

    "text": "I’m Tired and Defeated I am a newer nurse and I have given nursing my all. Working as a covid nurse, vaccine nurse, tele nurse, vent nurse and I am heartbroken, angry, and burnt out. I was bright eyed and bushy tailed starting my first job. I had my engraved Stethoscope, my personalized ID reel, Dansko clogs and a ton of pens and markers ready to take on whatever came my way. I was handed over to an experienced nurse who took me under her wing and showed me the correct way to do things. I was building confidence, taking initiative and expanding my knowledge base and skills. I was proud to walk into that room and introduce myself as a nurse. \n\nThen covid hit, and everything I was taught changed. Patients got sicker, staff got sick, the floor was now short, I had to pick up the pace because people’s lives were on the line. Equipment became harder to find, and everyone needed IV treatments, bladders needed to be scanned, meds needed to be given, venti masks needed to be titrated, endless providers and family members wanted to be called. The floor of experienced professionals I began with became a floor of new grads and float nurses. More and more staff kept leaving for outpatient jobs or retiring altogether. As I transitioned from one job to another I saw things were being skipped in an effort to save time, things were being missed due to the shear level of intensity the day’s assignment was providing. Patients were suffering. \n\nI’m stressed out. Will I be able to get everything done during my shift? Will this pt desat before there is an open bed in MICU? Who do I ask for help when the whole floor is just as inexperienced as me? Trying to document and give meds while tele monitors and pulse ox sats are alarming, family members calling nonstop asking to speak to their loved ones and me not having the time to FaceTime them because I have admissions, discharges and procedures to prepare for. Not taking a break to pee, drink water or eat because everyone is so sick that I don’t have time. Crying. Endless crying. Going home and second guessing everything you have done and wondering if you could have done more. But how could I do more when I’ve given my all?\n\nI’m mad. I’m mad at hospitals for valuing profits over their staff. I’m mad that unsafe ratios are now the new norm. I’m mad that if you dare challenge these ratios you are told to go home if you don’t like it. I’m mad that the only gratitude we seem to receive is in the form of pizza and not more money, PTO, or mental health counseling. I’m mad that I’m being taught bad habits. Is this what it has come to? My pt has to lay in their own urine because the floor only has one CNA and I can’t turn and clean them by myself? My pts have to get their IV meds late because I’m sharing one pump between my whole district? My desating pt has to wait hours to go to intensive care because there aren’t any beds? Management sits on their ass, but then has the audacity to tell me my white boards aren’t updated and I have a call bell going off while I’m in the middle of titrating a venti mask? I ask for help, and I’m told by countless people “I would love to help you, but I’m way too busy right now.” I’m mad that this country’s healthcare system is on the verge of collapse because money trumps safety, mental health, and loyalty.\n\nI’m scared that this pandemic will continue for years to come because people would rather spread the virus to others, than get vaccinated or wear a mask in the name of “freedom.” I’m scared that many healthcare professionals will never return due to PTSD and mental health issues from working during the pandemic. I’m scared for the patients currently in the hospitals, nursing homes, LTC centers because I know that they are not getting the care and attention they deserve. I’m scared of getting sick, I’m scared of my family and friends getting sick, I’m scared that healthcare might not recover. \n\nI’m embarrassed to work with people who don’t believe in science and would rather take their chances of getting themselves and their pts sick, rather than getting vaccinated. I’m embarrassed that people in the nursing profession are protesting vaccines and masks, but yet continue to care for critically ill patients. What kind of reputation does that give us as a whole? Once the most respected profession, now we are divided over a vaccine? They would rather quit our jobs than protect themselves and their patients? \n\nI’m tired. I’m tired of hearing pts with covid tell me the virus is fake. I’m tired of hearing “it’s just the flu, you guys got it wrong.” I’m tired of getting yelled at by family members who say I’m keeping them from their loved ones because visitors aren’t allowed on the covid floor. I’m tired of being verbally abused by entitled pts. I’m tired of having to explain the benefits of the vaccine to people who don’t care about others safety. I’m tired of opening Facebook or social media and seeing people protesting masks and vaccines outside of a hospital where people are inside fighting for their lives. I’m tired of opening up social media and seeing people I know that are unvaccinated walking around crowded places without masks or regard for anyone else’s safety. I’m tired of hearing nurses who refused the vaccine cry and whine about losing their jobs because they were “healthcare hero’s” for so long. I’m tired of working my whole shift without eating, peeing or even taking a single sip of water. I’m just so damn tired.\n\nI finally broke. This job, this world broke me. A person who was once free spirited, happy and open minded is now burnt out, heartbroken and discouraged. Ridden with anxiety, sadness, anger and every emotion in-between; I have nothing left to give. I was told it would happen, eventually I would become that nurse bitter hardened nurse that everyone talks about. I just never thought it would happen so soon. I need a break, time to clear my mind, take time for myself and my mental health because I was expecting a challenge, but I wasn’t expecting this. No one was expecting this. \n\nTo every nurse on this sub, every nurse still working on the front lines doing thankless work for unvaccinated covid pts who don’t care, to every nurse who has pulled a double and come in on their days off to help, to every nurse who has slept outside or away from home because they were afraid of getting their family sick, to every nurse who held a pts hand and comforted them during this pandemic, to every nurse who is still going, god bless you❤️❤️❤️",

    "text": "The problem with nursing and healthcare… [Throwaway username-this is likely a caustic topic]\nBG: ER/ICU nurse. Mid-20s. 2-3 years in nursing. \n\nIf you have been a nurse and a human with a body for any period of time, you’ve likely been on both the caregiving and care-receiving ends of the ‘system’. Of recent I’ve only genuinely started to understand how incredibly corrupt this system is. \n\nPatient side:\n\nWent to the ER (that I work PRN in) for a possible kidney stone and was sent a $3k+ bill after insurance from the hospital and subsequent $2-300 bills for the physicians services, the lab services, the radiological services. I was a bit shocked. Yes, got a CT, meds, fluids, was there for maybe 2 hrs-and a few months later I’ve got almost 5k in bills for an ED visit. Insurance paid almost $13k…..$18k in total between me and insurance. I get it-emergent anything costs $$. Paid the bills. But started watching what costs so much..\n\nNursing side:\n\n(Context: I left ED and went to ICU)\nMy hospital requires the nurse to enter charges for any type of skilled procedure and supplies used at the end of shift. POC glucose checks/ IV starts all the way up to assisted procedures with intubation and bedside EVDs. Each incurs a cost code. Yes-some of these procedures require a neurosurgeon to come to the unit and do a procedure so I understand the associated labor/supplies cost. Are they extremely excessive when you look at the hospital’s charge master (the list published by individual hospitals for the amount billed for the procedures)? IMHO, yes. \nDoes my POC glucose check warrant a $127 charge?\nI didn’t think so. \nDive down into coded charges more and you see a litany of charges for “Elevated HOB greater than 30 deg.”  Because I charted (not charged) basic safety snd comfort measures-my pt is getting charged an undisclosed amount. Keep in mind, none of this is reflected on my pay stubs-it’s solely so they can charge the pt more. \n\nMoreover: The hospital has case managers who are keen on how insurance companies pay out for various levels of care based of diagnostic criteria/medical management/time MDs are at bedside (you will see this in progress notes..”I spent 40 minutes wherein I was directly available to the patient and providing direct patient care…blah blah”). These case managers chart review their pts and will tell the MDs/APPs to order an aspirin or consult PT/OT/SLP so that the patient falls into a higher level of billable criteria for whatever insurance they have.\n\nOn the flip side-at my hospital there is the “clinical ladder” where if you work hard, cross all your Ts and dot all of your Is, get your CCRN, CEN, Masters..whatever… you’ll get an extra 50 cents per hour….I’m sorry…how corporate top-heavy can you sound without just printing it on white paper?!\n\nWith all this in mind and looking at what I’m being paid to be a puppet to this corruption…I don’t know how anyone would want to do this…what part of sacrificing your body, goodwill, emotional stability, time to further your knowledge (for that extra 50 cents), self-worth, and life outside of work sounds like fun? Nursing school and the greater corporate push instills this holistic care and emotional attachment to your work while taking a ride on your back for their own monetary gain. Understaffing and undersupplying their nurses while telling them that they are “so important” and driving that ego train. \n\nI don’t get it. Someone please help me understand why anyone would want to do this.\n\nEdit: Clarity",

    "text": "Nursing student: should I ignore it or report it? Hi all, thanks for being suppportive and helping new nurses/students...\n\nI am wondering where to strike the balance between \"not causing trouble\" and intervening when I see nursing teachers do really concerning things. Recently, one of my teachers in lab (who is a long-time nurse) kept making racist jokes (she was voice-acting as the dark-skinned mannequin, and kept putting on a \"black voice\"... saying things like \"don't touch my weave!\")...needless to say she's a white lady.\n\nShe also did a really rude impression of me in front of the whole class to demonstrate how bad I was at going through a procedure, then she kept telling me to \"watch all the other students\", but didn't really specify what I was supposed to watch for. Finally to cap it off she spent the last 20 minutes of class venting about how her patients this past week have been \"bitches\" and her new coworker is a \"new nurse bitch\"... This was all in a single class period. I mean, it seems like this lady had a rough week with patients and coworkers and is taking it out on students, and i feel pretty bad for her tbh, but also I have ADHD and I would really just love to take one class where the teacher doesn't make fun of me for it.\n\nAnyway, I've been dreading seeing this teacher again. I am wondering: should I just smile and take it, knowing that these people are the gatekeepers to clinicals and the rest of nursing? OR should i complain because this person made me want to peel my skin off with how mean and insensitive she is, and legitimately this is so concerning that someone is allowed to behave this way.... How have you guys managed?",

    "text": "In 4th of nursing school, but don’t like nursing what should I do? (Kind of long sorry, please don’t be mean) Hi, so I’m in my 4th year since I’m doing a BSN. I initially went into nursing since I really like the science courses I took in high school and I’m going to admit, I also chose it this career because of the money. Have always been good at math, physics, bio and chem. I took the first year courses like anatomy, physiology, microbiology, patho physiology and pharmacology in my second year and I really liked them. For our school we started clinicals in 2nd year at a long term care facility. It was for us to learn things like how to give a bed bath, feeding, how to change briefs, and how to use mechanical lifts and transfer belts. I did not enjoy doing these things and this was when I first wanted to switch out of the program and pursue a different career. People were telling me to just stick with it since it I was still in my first semester of second year and that it might “grow on me”, and the problem is it never did. I’ve done acute care (they call med-surg in the states apparently), mental health, and community health rotations and now I am finally in my nursing leadership and management rotation in my 4th year starting Monday.\n\n In my 3rd year I actually failed my first acute care (med-surg) rotation only 4 days into the rotations. The main issue was my instructor who singled me out because of my race, I am asian by the way, and everyone in my clinical group was white. She would always nick-pick at things such as correct me on my words when I would say wash my hands and she would correct me and be like “no one has time to wash their hands all the time its called hand hygiene”. She also made comments about why I dyed my hair blonde to try to fit in with caucasian people and that its too long and I need to cut it. She accused me of neglecting my patient because a nurse on that floor offered me the opportunity to do a wound dressing on her patient and I went to go do it. There were a bunch of other things as well but I’m not going to go into it too much since this post is already so long, but most of the other members of my clinical group also had issues with her but they did recognize that our instructor kept singling me out. After she failed me, I had to go to the student advisor to get my schedule revised since they change our curriculum, added in the leadership and management rotation and took out our OB rotation, which then meant I had to do an extra year of school, so 5 years in total.\n\n I continued with my schooling and rotations and never felt that spark or passion for nursing, I was just doing them in order to get a good mark and pass. A lot of the students seemed to have this nurturing personality and genuinely loved the relationships they have created with their patients and they always share stories during post-conference at the end of our clinical shift, and I always had nothing to share because I didn’t really care, I just wanted to go home and study for other classes. \n\nI was doing my preceptorship on a cardiac surgery unit in the fall term 2020 (Sept to December) and my preceptor did not pass me, she even asked me during our zoom meeting if I liked nursing or not and that she sees my heart is not in it and its kind of sad. So I have to repeat this preceptorship in the spring/summer semester (May to august) after I do this leadership and management rotation from January to April, which makes it 5.5 years in university in total I'm going to be in by the end. I’ve realized I don’t really love nursing and should of switched out during my very first clinical rotation I’ve ever had to save time and money. But I have two semesters left to do and the smart thing is just to finish it so at least I have a bachelor’s degree and then pursue something else. I was thinking of doing computer science, engineering, or pharmacy but I’m already 22 years old and don’t have much time left. \n\nI know I’m going to get a lot of people who are mad at the reason why I choose nursing, but believe me when I say I really wanted to love nursing, but I just didn’t. I’m literally crying as I write this because I’m so miserable, I can’t see myself doing this for 45 years. I’ve googled non-bedside nursing jobs and they all seem to need years (like 5-7 years) of experience as a bedside RN and I don’t want to put myself through that suffering just to get a job in public health or informatics. So I just need some help here on options :(",

Recently, a hacker broke through the firewall of my hospital's computer system so my hospital has been in code white for a few weeks now, meaning EVERYTHING is scrictly paper charting. We aren't even allowed to access our email. I'm currently on my second day of my ICU Transition Program, preceptoring under an ICU nurse. I pulled a new stringe of fentanyl and a precedex to replace the empty one in my pts room before the end of my shift. The problem is that I might have forgot to chart on the paper Mar that I hung/pulled the 2 meds. I don't come back to work until 5 days later and I'm concerned the pt would have been d/c'd by then so I  won't be able to have access to their chart to fix/check my mistake. What are my options. I was thinking of emailing the manager about my concerns but I'm worried that I'll get my preceptor in trouble since he trusted me to document my stuff on the Mar. I'm also worried this is something I can get in trouble for if I let the manager know. Would I get in trouble for forgetting to chart a med. Would it even be noticed or matter once the pt is d/cd? I really dont want ro esculate to my supervisor or manager if it's unessecary. I don't know anyone else on the unit well enough to call them or even have them correct my error for me, plus I'm new and I don't want to draw unnessacary attention to myself. What are my options? Should I just wait it out and see if the pt will still be there when I get back so I can fix the charting will the mistake even be noticed since the paper charting system has been a complete mess?",

A user in the politics sub laid out in comments a very lucid account of how his seemingly integrated school is in fact very segregated and has very different outcomes for white and PoC students. I've seen aspects of this in schools I've worked in -- although not quite as stark or severe -- and I wondered how common this from the perspective of U.S. teachers here. And what can we as educators do to address this sort of structural inequality?\n\nThis sub doesn't allow x-post links, so I'm excerpting -- you can find the post on r/bestof.\n\n>At my high school the way it worked was the school itself was a very old  and historic downtown institution. Hundreds of years old.  Big beautiful  building literally on the tallest hill.  \n>  \n>Lots of famous people graduated from it in the early 20th century, and not surprisingly it was all-white for most of that time.  \n>  \n>\\[...\\] in the  2000s the freshman class was about 30% black and 20% Latino.  \n>  \n>It was a relatively good school; so it’s not a surprise that PoC students who lived in walking distance wanted to attend.  \n>  \n>And they *really* wanted to attend, because their other options were the two all-black high schools or the one Latino high school. \\[...\\]  \n>  \n>Side  note:  those two schools were literally toxic (built on a superfund  site), and literally crumbling (walls falling down). They were sh$t  holes.   The Latino high school was a little nicer, but still seriously  underfunded and >95% Spanish speaking IIRC.  \n>  \n>None of those three schools had college admission rates over 25% or graduation rates over 75%.  \n>  \n>Anyway,  the white kids however, were mostly rich kids who were 2nd, 3rd, 4th,  or even 10th generation students! \\[...\\]  \n>  \n>“4th  generation rich white kids” don’t live near downtown in the modern American Midwest city— so most of the white students were commuting up to an hour to get to class. \\[...\\]  \n>  \n>The school actually had a  very very big waitlist for these “out of district” spots, and was  operating significantly over capacity.  We even had portable “temporary”  classrooms set up on the practice football field.  \n>  \n>But the **alumni donations**  from these rich multigeneration families made up a large portion of the  operating budget of the school.

BUT, a new 50 would transfer *into* the school.  \n>  \n>So  the graduating white class would be about 500. Over 95% of the white  graduates went on to attend a four year colllege, many of them Ivy  Leagues.  \n>  \n>Of the 500 PoC students,  about 250 would drop out, or be forced by the academic office to change  schools by Junior year.  Another 100 would drop out or transfer before  the end of senior year.  \n>  \n>About 150  total would graduate.  About half of them would go to college, and less  than half of that group would graduate college.  \n>  \n>So final score for “preparing students for life” is:  \n>  \n>500 PoC freshmen = about 150 high school diplomas and about 40 college diplomas.  \n>  \n>500 white freshmen = about 500 high school diplomas, and about 400 college diplomas.  \n>  \n>Also,  it’s hard to even know the distinction between drop out and transfer,  as the system was designed to hide the drop out rates.

They just never listed those kids as attending.  \n>  \n>The  kids functionally just disappear from the system like they have moved  out of state.

    "text": "That does it. I'm out. I've had enough.\n\nFirst it was getting screwed out of a promotion when new management came in.  I busted my ass for this time and earned my stripes with the previous management,  for which I was offered a department lead position.  I wouldn't have cared if they said \"Look, you've only been working here for two-and-a-half years and Alice has been working here for 5.  We believe the most senior person should get promoted.\"  But they went out of their way to show that Alice (not her real name) is the new golden child (she's the only member of the old staff who got promoted - they brought their own people in for other leadership/management roles).\n\nNew admin is cliquey.  They show no sign of wanting to support the teachers who are already here, who have been building the school for the last 5 years.  They've made it clear that they have no faith in certain teachers (in particular former military and industry), since they prefer the \"traditional path\" teachers.\n\nNow this:\n\nOur school is divided between students who are above-average to pretty strong academically and students who really struggle to keep up.  30% are pretty strong academically, and 50% are just average, and 20% are lagging behind.  Recently new management has decided something has to be done about the disparity.  They claim that there is a disparity among achievement among ethnic groups.  Asian, Latino and White students tend to do better than Black students.  They want to correct this.  Most teachers agree that something should be done, but we just don't agree about HOW it has to be done.\n\nNew admin suggests what essentially amounts to cooking the books.  Since we're private, we don't have IEP's.  Kids who are struggling are placed in a special \"Learning Assistance Program\".  Students in this program cannot be given lower than a 60 on any assignment as long as that assignment is turned in.  They can't be failed for a class until we've met with the parents three times, and a reams of paperwork are signed.  Electives and sports count towards GPA, and we're to make accomodations in grading as well.  Kids in the Learning Assistance Program can't be suspended.  They get special projects that basically boost their GPA.  Teachers have to bump up grades sometimes by more than an entire letter grade at the request of admin for these projects, which for whatever reason, we're not allowed to see.  Honors classes will no longer be weighted.\n\nThe result is that even less than one month in, in the Learning Assistance Program are basically starting to game the system.  In some cases I was basically requested to dictate the correct answers to students during tests, or to upload homework answers to Moodle so that the students could \"print that out and submit it\".  Literally all they're doing is printing stuff out, putting their name on it, and I'm required to give them an A because they've answered everything correctly.\n\nNot to mention that we now have kids intentionally acting up in class (e.g. dancing in the aisles  or bouncing a basketball to get on teachers' nerves), or in some instances verbally threatening teachers.  Some students have been openly defiant and admin shrugs it off because \"different cultures have different attitudes towards authority\".  These kids are acting up are either white or black American.  The \"different culture\" kids are more or less respectful.\n\nNeedless to say, some people think it's unfair.  We have a lot of first-generation Asian and Latino immigrants who came to this country with the dream of \"making something of themselves\".  These kids are driven as heck to perform well academically.  But they are not given Learning Assistance.\n\nAdmin doesn't want to backpedal on the policy and demands that we check our privilege, ignoring that our student body and current academic team is pretty diverse already.\n\nI refuse to lie just so my admins can look good and appear as some great humanitarians when they are chasing their own ego.  As soon as I've secured a job for next year, I'm out.",

    "text": "Tennessee educators oppose attacks on teachers’ free speech rights [Statement of the Tennessee Educators Rank-and-File Safety Committee](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/07/20/tenn-j20.html) regarding the recent passage of a bill that bans the discussion of anything that “promot\\[es\\] division between, or resentment of, a race, sex, religion, creed, nonviolent political affiliation, social class, or class of people.” Essentially a ban on critical race theory, discussion of social class, or any other perspective on history that runs counter to the state government's desired world view. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Tennessee Educators Rank-and-File Safety Committee opposes the legislation (HB 0580/SB 0623) passed by Tennessee’s right-wing legislature aimed at intimidating teachers and attacking their free speech and academic freedom.\n\nThis legislation includes a prohibition against instruction that “promot\\[es\\] division between, or resentment of, a race, sex, religion, creed, nonviolent political affiliation, social class, or class of people.”\n\nLater, the bill nonsensically qualifies this prohibition with the claim that “this section does not prohibit” schools or instructors from making use of textbooks or instructional materials that discuss “the history of an ethnic group” or include “the impartial discussion of controversial aspects of history” or “the impartial instruction on the historical oppression of a particular group of people based on race, ethnicity, class, nationality, religion, or geographic region.”\n\nThis distinction between the “promotion” of divisions and the “impartial discussion” of them seems to be intentionally vague. We cannot escape the conclusion that the legislators hope to intimidate teachers into avoiding controversial topics to avoid getting into trouble.\n\nA [series of similar laws](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/06/22/crit-j22.html) has been passed throughout the country in states with Republican-dominated legislatures. As awful as they are, these laws are only the opening shot in a broader campaign to undermine any kind of socially critical instruction in schools. Two laws recently [passed in Florida](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/06/26/flor-j26.html) go even further than the legislation in Tennessee and serve as a warning to educators everywhere.\n\nThe Florida laws restructure civics education in high schools and require that students pass a civic literacy assessment either in high school or in college in order to prove their grasp of the supposed evils of communism as compared with the supposedly more democratic US political system. The legislation requires public universities to survey faculty and students on their political beliefs and face a possible loss of funding if not enough students and faculty profess their allegiance to a right-wing perspective. Nothing in the legislation guarantees the anonymity of the responses, which brings into question what will be done to those individuals who answer in a way that displeases the state’s right-wing legislature.\n\nFrom the anticommunist McCarthyite witch-hunts in the United States to the purging of Jewish and left-wing academics from German universities by the Nazi party, the practice of drawing up lists of dissidents has a dark history.\n\nThe Tennessee Educators Rank-and-File Safety Committee condemns this legislation and stands with Florida primary and secondary school and university teachers and students in opposing these laws.\n\nAlready, the Tennessee legislation has been used to target an individual teacher. Matthew Hawn, a tenured high school social studies teacher in Sullivan County, Tennessee, came under attack the day after the state legislature passed HB 0580/SB 0623 into law. Hawn assigned his class to read an essay titled, “The First White President,” by Ta-Nehisi Coates, that was published in the *Atlantic*. For this he was censured by the school board and suspended without pay pending possible termination.\n\nOur committee has fundamental disagreements with the theoretical foundations and historical claims expressed by Hawn himself and outlined in this essay. This outlook is inspired by the concepts of critical race theory, which posits the existence of irreconcilable racial divisions in our society, above all in the working class. Nevertheless, we oppose all efforts to censor Hawn and other teachers who have views similar to his. The open discussion of a variety of points of view is of the utmost importance to the education of young people in our society.\n\nSocial class is the fundamental division in our society, not “race, sex, religion, or creed.” Class divisions and the resentments they produce are real, not the mere inventions of teachers. Moreover, the current fascistic and anti-socialist attacks on teachers are taking place in the context of a dramatic intensification of real class divisions.\n\nNowhere are divisions of class more apparent than in the response of the political representatives of the ruling class to the emerging coronavirus variants, which threaten to reverse even the meager progress accomplished by the partial vaccination of the US and world population. The emergence of these variants is the direct result of the politicians’ criminally irresponsible policies of herding workers back into unsafe working conditions and teachers and students back into unsafe schools. Meanwhile, the wealthy continue to have access to safe working environments and the best care the medical profession has to offer.\n\nIgnoring the urgent warnings of the World Health Organization and epidemiologists around the world, the Biden administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reversed masking recommendations, continuing in all fundamental respects the very same policies pursued by the Trump administration. This has provided fertile ground for the virus to evolve, further threatening the lives of workers and their children.\n\nThe Delta variant now presents a triple threat in the schools. Under conditions where children under 12 years old, roughly half the school-aged population, are not yet eligible for vaccination, and most children 12 years old or older remain unvaccinated, the withdrawal of mask recommendations will fuel the spread of the disease, promoting the evolution of new and even more dangerous variants, and killing or permanently disabling an untold number of children, teachers, their family members and the broader population.\n\nNational divisions in vaccine production and distribution, which have created a situation where most of the world’s poorer countries have little or no access to any COVID-19 vaccine, are further fueling these same processes.\n\nIf human life rather than private profit were the priority, the pandemic could be brought under control within months. However, the capitalist classes in nearly every country have not taken the necessary measures to end the pandemic because doing so would run counter to their profit interests.\n\nThe wealth divide in American society continues to grow, intensifying the class struggle on a global scale. Aided and abetted by the corrupt, corporatist trade unions and their pseudo-left acolytes, the American capitalists are pursuing record profits at the expense of human lives. Worldwide, billionaires’ wealth surged 60 percent during the first year of the pandemic alone.\n\nAgain, teachers have not *created* these class divisions and antagonisms. The capitalist class itself is working with ruthless abandon to deepen the existing divisions in our society, which is the real cause of deepening resentments. How could we *not* resent the fact that the capitalist class is threatening the lives of working people and our children simply in order to enrich itself?\n\nThe capitalists are well aware that they cannot get away with their homicidal behavior indefinitely without producing a massive social explosion the likes of which the world has never seen. Under conditions in which the class struggle increasingly threatens to break out of the stranglehold of the corporatist trade unions, which for decades have functioned as little more than an auxiliary police force for workplace management, the capitalist class, above all its more fascistic elements, are concerned about the role that public education institutions could come to play in the discussion and dissemination of ideas critical of the capitalist system itself.\n\nSo, we understand *why* the Tennessee legislature is attacking our free speech and trying to intimidate us into silence. However, understanding and justification are not the same thing. HB 0580/SB 0623 is unjustifiable and unconstitutional. Teachers have the first amendment right to discuss and oppose the acts of class warfare of the capitalist class, including in the classroom.\n\nWe demand the immediate repeal of HB 0580/SB 0623, the immediate reinstatement with back pay of Michael Hawn, and an end to all further efforts to victimize individual teachers or their schools for the content of their instruction.",

    "text": "Coming Full Circle / Le Cordon Bleu & the Public School System I'm a dual certified teacher with 17 years as an elementary teacher and 14 years and counting in Culinary Arts. Despite having lived and worked in two different warzones as an expatriate teacher in the international American schools, nothing in my 31 years of experience could have prepared me for the past year. In reading the posts on this board, I have seen many complaints about lax district attendance requirements for virtual education and hybrid. I have also seen a growing number of posts about administrative pressure to inflate grades given how abysmally some students have become during the current crisis.\n\nWhile I have not had any first experience with grade inflation at my school, in an effort to \"improve\" our attendance rates, my district has unintentionally undermined our virtual instruction. Per district policy, we are required to mark students present if any one of the following conditions were met.\n\n1. The student attended your virtual class. (It doesn't matter if the student just logged in and then logged out without bothering to stay for instruction. The mere fact that he or she even bothered to log on counts towards attendance credit for that student's class.)\n2. The student didn't log into your virtual class but did log onto Canvas which is our instructional support platform where we keep all student lessons and assignments. If a student logged into Canvas on the day you had your virtual class, that student will be marked as present.\n3. If the student sends his or her teacher an email on the day you had a virtual class, that student will be marked present.\n\nThe students aren't stupid. A lot of them have milked the system and my attendance rate has dropped to the point where I only have 1-2 students out of a class of 16 who bother to attend any of my virtual classes.\n\nConcurrent with the bad attendance has been the growing failure of students to complete any of my assignments. At least 40% of my students are failing. Some haven't even logged onto Canvas in two months.\n\nI think there are a lot of parallels between what's been happening in many of our public school systems and what happened to the American division of the Le Cordon Bleu culinary schools.\n\nIn France, Le Cordon Bleu is a widely respected and venerated culinary school that was first opened in 1895. Throughout the last 126 years, a succession of great chefs have taught the next generation of culinarians whose ranks have included the likes of Julia Childs, Giada De Laurentiis, and Mario Batali\n\nIn 2000 Le Cordon Bleu entered into a partnership with Career Education Corp. (CEC), a company that bought up private vocational schools in the United States.  Instead of adopting the Le Cordon Bleu curriculum and standards, the CEC slapped the Le Cordon Bleu logo on their culinary uniforms and campus signage. When the American division first opened, these schools included the Southern California School of Culinary Arts of Pasadena, California; the Western Culinary Institute of Portland, Oregon; the International Culinary Academy of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; the Scottsdale Culinary institute of Scottsdale, Arizona; and the Midwest Culinary Academy of Mendota Heights, Minnesota. In time, the American maintained and operated 16 schools. Trading upon the Le Cordon Bleu name, at the height of their popularity these schools generated an annual net revenue of some $100 million dollars.\n\nAs a 2003 Le Cordon Bleu graduate, I had the dubious distinction of watching this school begin its slow decline almost from the moment it first opened its doors. After having burned out as an elementary teachers after 17 years in the profession, I cashed out my Texas Teacher Retirement account to pay for my tuition at the Texas Culinary Academy in Austin. I was 40 years old at the time. My father still insists that I was having a mid-life crisis.\n\nMy class had about forty students. While most of the students were recent high school graduates, our very oldest classmate was in his 50's, though a life of hard living had made him look a decade older. I was the 2nd oldest student in the class. There were also a handful of students in their 30's. The ranks of the older students included a registered nurse, a veteran who had mustered out after 20 years in the service, a pastor, a computer engineer, and a restaurant line cook.\n\nOur school uniforms consisted of white culinary jackets with the Le Cordon Bleu logo emblazoned over the left chest. We also wore herring bone black and white cook trousers, black socks, and close toed non-skid shoes, along with a white skull cap. In addition to our textbook, we were each issued a black tool kit that included a complete knife set.\n\nAlthough the CEC had published and distributed a set of student handbooks that outlined the school rules and expectations, these standards were rarely applied. In theory, students who were late to class should have been barred from attendance and made to attend a Saturday makeup session. In reality, none of the chef instructors seemed to care if students were as much as 30 minutes late.\n\nStudents were expected to come to class wearing clean uniforms. In reality, some students came to class wearing jackets that were stained with ingredients that had been used during the previous day. One student even showed up wearing sandals with black socks. The chef instructor let this student stay even though his clothing was a health code safety violation.\n\nA lot of the younger students didn't bother doing their reading assignments or their written homework. Many of these didn't even bother to take notes in class before we went to the kitchen for our hands-on production lessons.\n\nSince most culinary classes teach students in cooperative learning groups of 3-4, the older students banded together into two groups out of vested self interest. We did this because we had work ethics and standards. We read the assignments. We completed the written homework. We also took notes.\n\nDuring our lab time in the kitchen, many of the younger students would disappear for extended smoke breaks of 30 minutes or longer. They wouldn't help with production. They wouldn't help with cleaning the kitchen. Since we were working in cooperative groups, each group shared a common grade. Those of us who were responsible didn't think that these other students deserved to share our grade since they made no contributions to our group effort.\n\nAt the end of our course of study, as part of our graduation requirement we were expected to complete a three month externship under the supervision of a chef or a kitchen manager. Students who had been allowed to develop slovenly habits and to show up late for class had a rude awakening when they tried to act the same way in the commercial food service.\n\nEven though the Le Cordon Bleu schools were still relatively new, by the time I got to my externship, it was hard finding anyone who would take me. The Texas Culinary Academy had already developed a dismal reputation among most of the area restaurants. Students were late to work. Students were improperly attired. Students thought they could get away with 30 minute smoke breaks. Those students who hadn't paid attention in class and who had not assisted in the kitchen were quite out of their depth and lacked the basic skills that a culinary extern should have had.\n\nI was lucky. I eventually found a placement with a boutique hotel that had an attached French restaurant. I completed my externship without problems and graduated with honors. As with nearly anything else in life, what I got out of the program reflected what I had put into it. I went on to work in the food service for five years before returning to education as the chef instructor of a high school Culinary Arts program.\n\nI was successful. A lot of my former classmates were not. Since Le Cordon Bleu did not hold their students to high standards, their reputation suffered. In time, student externs could not find placements. Le Cordon Bleu graduates could not find jobs.  In 2015, CEC tried to sell their schools but the Le Cordon Bleu label was so badly tarnished in the United States that they wound up announcing their pending closure. No new enrollments were accepted after January of 2016. The last classes graduated in September of 2017.\n\nLe Cordon Bleu is an example of what can happen when you don't enforce high expectations regarding attendance, student participation, and grades.\n\nI started teaching in 1982 before President George Bush's No Child Left Behind Act ushered in accountability testing. For those of you who are old enough to recall what teaching was like BEFORE accountability testing you may remember that some schools and some districts had similar lax standards.\n\nBefore accountability testing, elementary students were often \"socially promoted.\" It didn't matter that these students were failing and had cruddy attendance. During my first elementary teaching job in a Title I district on the south Texas border, my principal told me that kids who were retained would suffer worse from the emotional trauma of being left behind than if they were promoted with \"a few\" academic deficiencies.\n\nAlthough I was a novice teacher at the time, I remember thinking that my 5th grade students were 2-3 grade levels deficient in both reading and math. If the principal thought that these were \"a few\" academic deficiencies, I couldn't help wondering what a glaring deficiency might have looked like.\n\nThe problem with having lax standards was that some schools were graduating students who were functional illiterates. Back in 1977, the U.S. Office of Education estimated that an estimated 23 MILLION American adults were functional illiterates who lacked the ability to read restaurant menus and train schedules.\n\nIn 1976, a student named [Peter W. sued the San Francisco Unified School District](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/217048241.pdf) because they had graduated him even though he was only on a 5th grade reading level and had failed several grades. The plaintiff alleged that in failing to properly educate him, he had been relegated to a life of manual labor since this was all that he was qualified to do. The trial court dismissed the complaint. This was subsequently upheld upon appeal because Peter W's failure of educational achievement was not accepted by the court as an \"injury: within the meaning of tort law.\n\nAnother lawsuit followed. In 1976 [Edward Donohue](https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/20/archives/a-graduate-who-says-he-cant-read-saying-he-is-functionally.html) was graduated even though he couldn't read at all. In 1977, he sued his former school for \"educational malpractice.\"\n\nHis lawsuit alleged that even though he had failed all of his classes during his junior year (except for woodshop), he was socially promoted and became a senior. He was even placed in a senior English class despite having failed English as a junior.\n\nDoes any of this sound familiar to our current education climate?\n\nThe teachers at Mr. Donohue's former high school said that there was an unofficial rule that said that they could not fail more than 15% of their students. Instead of actually educating their students, there was pressure from the building administration to graduate students as a way of getting rid of them.\n\nI  wish I could say that Edward Donohue had a fortuitous outcome to his lawsuit. I am sorry to say that he did not. In 1977 in [Donohue v Copiague Unified School District](https://www.leagle.com/decision/197948747ny2d4401440), the court found in favor of the district. The summary statement alluded to, \"the practical impossibility of proving that the alleged malpractice of the teacher proximately caused the learning deficiency of the plaintiff student. Factors such as the student's attitude, motivation, temperament, past experience and home environment may all play an essential and immeasurable role in learning. Indeed as the majority observes proximate cause might 'be difficult, if not impossible, to prove'.\"\n\nIt wasn't until 1981 ([Hoffman v. Board of Education](https://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1427&context=hlr)) that a plaintiff was (partially) successful in pursuing an educational malpractice lawsuit. Daniel Hoffman was a student in the New York City Schools. At the age of five the school district placed him in a class for the mentally retarded. He remained in this class for the next 12 years despite the fact that a school psychologist had insisted that he wasn't retarded but instead suffered from a low self image. Although the court awarded the plaintiff $500,000 in damages, this judgement was reversed upon appeal and the case was dismissed.\n\nThe reality for all of us is that this isn't 1976, 1977, or 1981. It's 2021 and the times have changed.\n\nIn 2016,  a high school graduate Jamarria Hall joined a class action lawsuit with six former students in suing the Detroit public schools because the district was graduating students who were illiterate. As a junior and later a senior Mr. Hall alleged that his English teachers taught him using 3rd and 4th grade level books.  His attorney alleged that his former school was literally falling apart and lacked certified teachers and up-to-date textbooks. It argued that conditions were so appalling that in one instance an 8th grade student took the initiative to teach math to his classmates for a month after his teacher quit and the school was unable to find a replacement.\n\nIn May of 2020, after four long years of legal battles, the Detroit Public Schools settled and agreed to pay the seven former students a total of $7 million to settle this education malpractice claim. In settling they have also created a legal precedent for future education malpractice claims.\n\nThe implications of this recent case should be clear. School districts may successfully be sued for educational malpractice. While school administrators seek short term relief by having teachers inflate grades so as to appease the school board and angry parents, if these practices were to continue, it could have serious legal implications in the years to come.\n\nNot to detract from the validity of anything that I have said, but this is also why teachers should belong to a union. Most unions offer legal representation and liability coverage as part of their benefits.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nEdited: I graduated from Le Cordon Bleu, Texas Culinary Academy in 2003, not 2001. That was a typo which has since been corrected. Since it was quite late at night (or early in the morning depending upon your perspective), I also corrected some grammatical mistakes.",

    "text": "Serious question: How do other educators tolerate the lack of accountability for extreme behaviors long term? I just took leave. I’m doing a lot of reflecting about what felt so unsustainable about this job, and whether I will be able to tolerate returning at some point. This is my second time in 3 years of teaching and six years in schools of reaching a breaking point. I’m wondering how others are able to tolerate, year after year, the lack of accountability for violent/anti-social behaviors that seems to be the norm. \n\nIt seems utterly unethical to tolerate this aspect. Entering teaching, I was onboard with the rhetoric about equity and non-exclusionary discipline being racist/biased.  I still believe historically there is a precedent for this claim and individual educator biases still make this an issue. I believe that many times excluding students harms/victimizes them. I believe in restorative justice and repairing harm when it’s been done. \n\nHowever. It seems we’ve swung way too far from “inequitable accountability” to “no accountability”. In the name of not inconveniencing our most difficult students and their difficult families, we have normalized tolerating constant abuse and violence. \n\nI care deeply about my most troubled kids. And I think that’s where our shift away from discipline comes from. But I cannot maintain the emotional stamina to support this kid if they are never held accountable by administration or parents. Because the truth is, I would never tolerate this from a colleague. It’s reasonable me and kids are reaching a point of no return in terms of forgiveness for these kids. I don’t think it’s unfair I have no patience left for this nonsense. \n\nWe can simultaneously allow room for mistakes and forgiveness while absolutely not tolerating certain behaviors. We can understand WHY kids don’t have appropriate skills and react violently. That can help us design interventions. But that doesn’t mean we let go of any standards. We can understand why kids are violent and angry without enabling further violence. \n\nIt seems like a losing cause, honestly. We need to start making violent/highly disruptive behavior highly inconvenient for parents or it will never stop. And to do this, we need administration to actually put the fire under the parents’ ass. Repeated incidents of violence? Demand a parent meeting before the kid can return. \n\nI have students who have repeatedly thrown chairs, hit, kicked, and CHOKED other students. I keep filling out office referrals and there is never any escalation.  A boy threw a chair at another student a second time last week and there wasn’t even a parent phone call made by the principal. I do not have the emotional stamina to argue with parents about why their kid chose violence. Every ounce of emotional energy for dealing with difficult people is spent during the school day on these kids. I need someone else to drive these disciplinary conversations. \n\nWhen are we going to stop making the inconvenience of a violent actor in a chaotic social environment a professional responsibility to tolerate rather than an issue to be turned around on the parents?\n\nAs I reflect on what broke me down so much, there are a lot of aspects. Workload, inability to leave things “behind at work”, my own challenges with organization and executive functioning. Ive been thinking about my ability to intentionally prioritize skills development in these areas while on leave. \n\nAnd that would certainly help, but it’s all moot if there’s no urgency about ending the constant violence and near-violence in my classroom. I really don’t think, even if I improve my skills in the areas that are under my control, that I can tolerate a lack of accountability for violence. This being such a prevalent aspect of my students experience creates all kinds of issues. I know my students aren’t safe and I can’t protect them ultimately. Therefore I’m always on edge for a violent escalation, which means teaching content is a far secondary priority. My kids are anxious and on edge because it’s not a safe learning environment. With all of us on edge, there is bound to be further escalations. \n\nConstantly telling parents of victims “it’s been handled” is eroding my own sense of personal integrity. Because I know it’s a lie, but I can’t tell them “sorry, nobody else will do anything. All I can do is intervene and put hands on kids when it inevitably happens,“ which as a white man in elementary feels increasingly risky. \n\nAnd lastly, from the standpoint of what’s best for both the abuser and the victims, it’s helping nobody. It’s teaching the victims that we should tolerate abuse and violence. It’s teaching the violent kids that they can be violent without repercussions, which I can easily see leading them into prison or death by adulthood. \n\nWhen does saying “hell no” trump reputation  management? When does the well being of the students and staff outweigh upsetting a parent? \n\nHow do you continue to show up every day without this aspect breaking your spirit?",

    "text": "Charter Schools are open-minded but sometimes throw the baby out with the bath water. This is my 5th year teaching, but first year at a charter school. I’m tired of it already. \n\nI know charter schools tend to think more outside the box but this charter school clearly went back the the drawing board. In the wrong way. \n\nOh! While we’re on “boards”, here is example #1:\n\n 1. It’s announced to teachers 2 weeks into back to school training that many white boards have not arrived and it’s not the schools fault at all. We were told they would arrive by the end of the 1st week of school. 2 weeks after that we were told that they wouldn’t arrive until October or November. 1 week later they were like “yeah who knows “. So I had been assuming that these whiteboards were the big interactive computer screens. But no, they were talking about dry erase boards. When I clarified this with the principal one day after school, she leaned and look at me all hard like “excuse me, who are you Chile?“. My room had dry erase boards already. Thought those and digital white boards were standard these days. Which brings me to why I was staying after school to have this conversation with the principal…\n\n2. We use projectors for display. And they are not stable. We travel to each classroom with our things. Makes sense in this era of humanity. However, don’t charge me with “wasting instructional time” when getting connected to each projector at the beginning of class. I had to stay after school to figure out a quicker way to connect. \n\n3. We just got a nurse like 7 school days ago and it wasn’t announced. This school announces everything! 3 days before that student almost had a panic attack. An email was sent concerning a back up plan since there was no nurse then-poof- one appeared. They had been claiming that it was soooo hard to find one. \n\n4. They just hired an office manager this week. They said it was very hard to find one of those too. Kept saying not to fill out purchase request forms because we didn't have an office manager (they bragged earlier on that at this school, all purchases are granted). The principals kept saying that they were also doing that job in addition to their own. Not really because a lot of things pertaining to that role were left undone. Such as purchases. More on that later. \n\n5. We don’t really have a principal right now. We have 2 co-principals. One has high management experience but no educational experience or certification. Her prior told was just managing the school. The second one is in her first year of principaling and she’s quite disorganized. We’ve had a different schedule every week. It keeps changing. At first, what was said of the principal who was in my interview in early Summer was that she was no longer “a good fit for the family” [ c u l t i s h - s o u n d i n g]. Then later we’re told by the principals that the job was forced on them when they came back from break. Point is, we could really use 1, preferably 2, experienced principals right now. \n\n6. Going back to purchases (this also ties back to the scheduling thing). So on the 2nd and 3rd day of school a ton of necessary things suddenly arrived— one being out classroom clocks. This is problematic because we were nice-scolded that we needed to transition on time (again, within 0 min as well). I rely on wall clicks and don’t use my phone a lot in class. You know, out of best practice. Principal said there was no reason for us to be late since we have the schedule in our phone and the time on our phone. But then those Amazon trucks arrived and they were unwrapping clocks which up then makes me think that ownership is not being taken. We were also threatened last week with low evaluation scores we didn't appear to our classrooms on time. \n\n\n7. Principals make us use a work app for communication during dismissal. Dismissal is almost always a hot mess. They refuse to use the (working) intercom system. \n\nAnd here’s my burning question: could the principals getting paid more for those positions they couldn’t find?",

    "text": "Should I break my contract? I'll make this quick, but I need unbiased advice. I'm a first year art teacher working a k-8 position. I love a lot of things about my job, for example, how easy lesson planning is at my current school, my co-worker(another at teacher), and my admin isn't to bad, but I don't really connect with my students culturally and I'm not as interested in the content I teach. I worked for 7 years as an illustrator and a fine artist and I find a lot of projects we do at this level boring. The school I'm teaching at is an upper class white school and the subtle homophobia and racism I experience on a daily basis feels draining. I'm white passing(mixed) and I look straight and my students don't know I'm gay and most assume I'm white. I can't comment on anything they say without fear of patents or repercussions from my administration, and I'm terrified of parents finding my marriage announcement on social media. A majority of the parents are involved in the PTA and are very involved in their children's education. My school's culture is conservative, Christian, and upper class, and my co-workers and admin reflect this demographic. I often find myself lying about my personal life to protect myself.\n\nI recently got a message from one of my mentors that her high school is looking to hire another art teacher and her principle wants me back as a teacher. The admin at this school is not as kind,  classroom management is harder, and the population is title 1 and needs more TLC, but I love the content I would be teaching at this school, and I connected better with the student population. I grew up in foster care and I saw myself in my students. Sometimes it felt like I was teaching to a mirror because the way my students acted and behaved reminded me so much of myself and my friends. I can say I genuinely loved my students at this school. The principle at this school wants to offer me 3,000 more to teach than what I'm making now. I currently make 45,600 and I would be making 48,800 with the opportunity to get promotions and move up the pay scale when I get my masters degree. \n\nShould I break my contract and jump? Or stay at my current school? \n\nAlso, I've never broken and a contract before and could use some guidance on that topic as well.\n\nSorry for spelling errors I'm on mobile.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the advice. I appreciate everyone helping me and I'll post an update in the summer. I feel a lot more prepared than I did before and I'm going to let the other principle know that I'd like to to teach at the high school.\n\n I also had a pm asking me for more information regarding some of the homophobia and racism in my school. Inside and outside of my classroom I've heard students and co-workers use slurs or make fun of trans people. I've also had kids in my classroom discuss what their parents would do if they had a trans teacher( get them fired/harass them). I've had to deal with a lot of racism and it would be a long post if I listed everything, but yesterday for example I had a co-worker sarcastically ask me why \"Indians\" drank so much because she hated teaching kids with fasds at her last school. She doesn't know I'm Indigenous and is my team lead. I made the mistake of speaking up earlier in the year and was excluded from team activities and emails, even professional emails for proctoring and 504/IEP meetings. I've also gotten mean texts. I haven't felt like I could talk to anyone about this in my real life, so it feels nice to get this off my chest. Thank you everyone.",

    "text": "Minority teachers Can you please tell me your experiences in predominantly white districts? As I was doing research for an interview I have coming up, I noticed that there were articles about the effort of this district to hire black teachers as well as some incidences of racism. \n\nThere is a whole movement on FB about it actually. I also saw statistics of there being 1 black administrator and 1 Asian one in the district of about 7 schools. Also there are supposedly 14 black teachers and 350 white teachers. \n\nNow, I do not know how to feel. I would be leaving a predominately black and Hispanic school for this one. The title 1 school I’m at just lacks resources as far as good curriculum guides, students are progressing to grades without the right skill set for whatever reason, old and broken down equipment and classrooms, and I’ve been pretty frustrated with the lack of teacher support as a first year teacher. However, I’ve managed to take it all on and do a pretty good job considering what I was dealt and the lack of support for a new teacher. I mean this may seem small but I constantly get emails referencing things that need to be completed and I have no idea about it and that is frustrating but I guess to be expected?\n\nAnyway, what are your experiences as minority and especially black teachers (I am a black female teacher) in these districts?",

    "text": "Does anyone else feel like their mental health has drastically undermined their potential/career growth? Seriously considering leaving my current corporate job that probably sounds perfect on paper. Okay, so a few things I (M26) would like to preface to help shed some light on the situation a little more clearly:\n\n1. I've struggled with clinical depression for the better part of the past 9 years which, looking back on it all, has definitely influenced some major life decisions and makes it hard for me at times to determine if I'm thinking logically, or if it's my brain negatively impacting the way I'm perceiving everything. (Been in therapy rather consistently the past few years & have tried multiple antidepressants, but haven't found any that don't have serious side effects that create their own set of problems).\n2. I just bought my first home in the middle of last year which is the only debt that I currently have (no student loans/car payment/ etc.) and while the mortgage isn't bad ($735 + utilities), it turns out that there are probably $30-40K worth of repairs needed which means I have less financial flexibility than if I had decided to keep renting.\n3. While I hate to admit it, I'm absolutely terrible at managing my finances to the point that I currently have $1.02 in my savings account. Theoretically, I should have right around $1,000-1,200 disposable income every month, but yet it's not uncommon to find myself in the negative prior to payday each month (government job so I get paid once a month). I grew up in a superrrr low SES household and while that shouldn't be an excuse, I've found that it's made it hard for me to move away from the \"spend it while you have it\" mindset. The fact that I don't have a savings makes me hesitate to consider leaving the stable job that I have.\n4. I currently have my bachelor's degree in exercise science, have 2.5 years of corporate/healthcare experience, and worked in the oilfields during the summers to help pay for school so I've seen the pros/cons of blue-collar vs. white-collar jobs.\n\nAll of that to say:I've been at my current job for about 2.5 years now (healthcare) and I'm trying to determine how much of my discontentment is circumstantial (the job/cultures/responsibilities), and how much of it is me self-sabotaging what I'm sure many people would consider a \"dream job.\" Most days, I find myself having to give myself a pep talk while opening the computer each morning -- making me terrified to think that this might be what the next 30 years of my life look like from M-F. There are a lot of pros/cons (both at my job and life circumstances outlined above) that have me trying to decide if I should just grind it out for a few more months and then take something less stressful, more physically engaging, more potential for upward mobility and/or compensation, or just keep my nose to the grindstone at my current job. I've considered learning a trade or just taking a drastic pay cut and doing something that allows me to leave work at work and be more \"engaged\" from 9-5. I keep going back and forth because some weeks are much better than others and I'm highly motivated to get things done and \"climb the ladder.\" Most weeks, however, aren't so grand. A few pros/cons:\n\nPros:\n\n* Current employer matches 100% up to 10% of 401K contributions\n* Permanently get to work remote (free to travel as long as I deliver on job duties)\n* A LOT of autonomy\n* *Very* supportive supervisors\n* Youngest on the team by far and approximately 60-75% of the team will be retired (or close to retirement) within the next 3-5 years. This is also a bit of a \"con\" though as it can be harder to relate to team members.\n* Approx. 35 paid vacation/holiday days per year\n* Decent pay for being the start of my career (compared to what some of my college classmates are making).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCons:\n\n* Really don't feel like I'm building anything for myself. Like, working towards whatever it was that I was put here on earth to do... if that makes sense? Most days I feel like a paper jockey and that the work I'm doing really isn't all that meaningful. I know it is in the big picture, but I know that I'm easily replaceable.\n* Lack of interaction with people my own age makes it feel somewhat isolated at times.\n* Lack of performance-based compensation/upward mobility. Some team members are doing 90% of a given task while others contribute 10% and get paid the same.\n* Compensation for job rules depends FAR more on the overall number of years experience, and far less on skills/certifications/annual performance. Because of that, I'm making $10,000-$20,000/year less than older team members who are performing similar job duties. Is this normal and I'm just ignorant as to how the world works?\n* I have severe imposter syndrome because while I'm very capable of doing the job, the lack of explicitly-stated responsibilities associated with my position means that most days I feel like I'm doing a terrible job and that I'll never feel proficient.\n* Things are pretty chaotic and projects are assigned in what feels like \"crisis mode.\" What we do is very \"reactive\" and less \"proactive,\" which, coming from someone who grew up in a super unstable home, keeps me on edge with my blood pressure staying elevated throughout the day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, maybe it's just Peter Pan syndrome and I'd feel this way anywhere I went, but I've talked with others at my job and they share similar sentiments. I guess I'm just wondering how much of it is me looking at it as a \"glass half empty\" POV, and how much of what I'm feeling is justified. And if I am justified to feel what I do, where do I go from here? Save X amount of money and then start applying to everything/anything? Any advice would be SO welcome as I feel pretty lost. (That being said, please don't hesitate to tell me if I need to suck it up and stop whining).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: spelling.",

    "text": "Is taking a career break stupid? TLDR: If I know I'll be leaving my job in the next year and unsure about where to take things next, would it be a good/bad idea to take a \"break\" and work part time while figuring things out and recovering? I have sizeable savings and an entirely liquid $20k emergency fund (this would get me through 6 months).\n\nContext: I'm a senior scientist in the biotech/pharma industry. I'm in my early 30's and my career has been moving along over the last 10 years but it's largely been joyless/passionless. It's all I know and it's what I'm competent/experienced with. It pays six-figs and has reasonable hours compared to some other jobs (50hr/week average).\n\nI recently left a stable job at a larger company for what I thought would be a much needed shake-up; the previous job paid well and was predictable, but the culture was growing increasingly corporate (losing work-life balance and sense of community) and my role was being pushed towards management rather than technical R&D. I took a pay cut and moved across the country for a tiny startup hoping to gain new skills and have more variety. It turns out the company wasn't forthcoming about it's situation (high turnover due to a toxic executive that can't be pushed out) and I don't think the company will last more than another year or two. What's probably more jarring/revealing though is that I'm still just an disinterested and apathetic towards my work. I think I may need to change careers.\n\nWith my eventual exit in the next year and continued lack of interest in my career, I've been contemplating trying something else before deciding if I need to continue on this career path or pursue another path. Is it a good idea to work a less mentally rigorous or part time job and take a \"break\"? I'm mentally exhausted (not to mention depressed/anxious from not knowing where my career is headed and moving away from my family and friends).\n\nI've always wanted to be in the food industry but was unsure if I would be OK with the long hours and the abrasive culture. I have a lot of food/cooking knowledge from years of hobby reading/watching/cooking/hosting but no pro kitchen experience. I'm completely prepared for a reality check and slithering back to more white collar jobs. I'm considering working in food/beverage part time after leaving my current job while I try to decide if I want to hit reset.",

    "text": "Navigating the modern DEI landscape as a vanilla white guy Last year, my company, along with many others, took the George Floyd murder and following protests as a reason to start getting much more serious about diversity and inclusion. Conceptually, I support this goal. \n\nPractically, though, this has lead to a few weird situations that make me wonder about my next steps. Managers are now evaluated on DEI goals. I applied for an internal position on another team, but was told by that team’s manager that I wasn’t being considered because I (white cis straight man) would not increase the teams diversity on any dimension. \n\nAdditionally, I’ve had several extremely qualified referrals ignored for the same reason. These referrals have proceeded to procure roles at various FAANG companies, so their skills are not in question. \n\nI will say that all of this has lead to a much more diverse team overall (albeit a very junior-heavy one). However, given that all this is being achieved with a very heavy thumb on the scale, I do wonder if this is the place for me longer term. I don’t think I would even be considered for an interview for my current role, and the DEI goals for the more senior roles make me wonder if I have “space” to be promoted. \n\nHas anyone encountered a similar environment before? What’s the best way forward as a completely non-“diverse” individual who has ambitions of achieving high-level technical leadership roles? It’s not as if vanilla white guys like me have had a hard time of things in general, but it’s hard not to see the immediate situation as a bit of a roadblock.",

    "text": "Question for hiring managers - UK Graduate - Using job offer from one company as leverage to get a job from another - do I need to prove this to new employer with signed contract? So I have had an 'almost' job offer from the company that I did my final year project with, they have already gotten a picture of me to do client stuff with, and have said for me to talk to them on Monday to finalise things, told me I wont need an interview, and the position isn't being offered to anyone else, and already told me the day they want me to start. So although I don't have an official offer from them yet Its pretty darn close.\n\nNow I don't want the job, and in order to not let them down I want to find a new one asap before my start date in 7 weeks. I have [read online](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/should-i-share-offer-details-with-other-opportunity-quora-vicki-salemi) that telling hiring managers about my current offer in the other jobs ill be interviewing for will help my case, as it shows employability.\n\nWhat I'm trying to figure out is if I can stop progress with the company that has offered me a job (verbally but non contractually), save myself and them a lot of time and effort, and then just tell a white lie to the new interviewers and say I already have a job offer, and get that same leverage (as I near as dammit do have the offer, just not in paper) Or will a situation come up where the new potential employer says 'Oh okay if you have been offered a job then prove it by showing us the contract'?\n\nIf the latter then I need to continue the pantomime with the old company until they give me the offer letter, It will be a let down for them, more work for me, but at the end of the day I 100% want to be able to use this job offer as leverage, so if that means I need an offer letter then thats what I have to do. If the former and I can get away with a harmless white lie (because I basically do have the offer), then it saves a load of effort with no harm done. But I want to hear the opinion of hiring managers before I do anything stupid or anything that could be considered mal practice.",

    "text": "Is this a valid reason to fire an employee? It took me a couple days to gather my thoughts and be able to look for some answers. And now, after getting tired of walking every nook and crannies of my house thinking of what I did wrong I decided to post here hoping that some veterans from the industry would leave a comment.\n\nI'm an electrical engineer and I had been working in embedded systems field (for about 6 years), doing embedded software for 80% of my time. I got a new job in September, as an embedded software engineer, joined a team of 3 seniors and 2 juniors.The first two weeks I had some self-training, where I had to read some documents, manuals and ask questions whenever I did not understand something. The next 5-6 weeks we had a team training for all the new members (me and the 2 new employees) and it was like university classes, it was online due to the pandemic and we would look at some presentations about how the industry works and some other things the company and our team would need to do.During those presentations-meetings we were asked questions (the new guys) like \"we would like each one of you to tell us what he thinks that one means, or how would we solve that problem\" etc. At the end of those weeks we gave \"exams\". We had a test-task like a \"real task simulation\" so the rest of the team (3 seniors) would see how we work and think. That took about 4-5 days and at the end we looked into it all together. That wasn't actually code it was a UML generated code and we would draw UML shapes and charts. It was the first time  we used the company's uml generator software which was still in the development phase too. I made some minor mistakes in the use of software some things should have be done differently and also some mistakes other more important mistakes like missing some things in the uml. my team who judged the results told me to be more careful about my work (1st warning). I apologized, admitted my mistakes and tried to get better.Later, meetings ended, I didn't know what the other new guys were doing at the moment and I was given some tasks. I had one big task that took about 1.5 months, broken down in smaller tasks of course. I ported about 15 projects from makefile to cmake. None of us knew cmake. We looked at it together at the beginning and I was just doing some experiments to help the team decide which way we should follow. I had my second warning when I pushed commits for reviews that had some copy-paste errors in cmake. like you take the cmakelist from one project and you start building the next one and I forgot to remove or rename a few variables etc. or I didn't see that some makefiles had some extra functions that I forgot to add etc...My third and last warning was when they asked me to setup an open-source program in my computer and install an add-on on it (from a public github repo on the internet). They asked me to set it up, create a test (draft) project and send it to them to see if it works ok, so they can be sure that the program works fine in my computer and they can send me tasks in the future. The add-on didn't work and my manager got angry because I didn't take the task seriously as I didn't put effort to make it work. I asked for help and they told me they were busy and we would look at it together some other time. I spent a few hours on the weekend trying to figure out what went wrong. I found out that the latest commit of this \"add-on\" had a bug. Checked out the previous commit and everything worked fine (I was doing the checks between my computers at home). I spoke to my manager about all this and let them know. the reply was \"ok it works now\" but I think it was already late and they had decided to fire me. So a month later they fired me. They called me in the office and that very moment they asked me to leave. They told me I'm not a good fit for the team and I should better look for something else. The rest conversation didn't matter and 30 minutes later, just before lunch, I was driving home.\n\nI think that's a good picture of the whole situation, please feel free to judge, I don't like white lies. I wanna get better  as a person and at my job because I love it.\n\nI have a few questions more about the incident.\n\nShould I mention all that in my future interviews?\n\nIs it going to affect my future career?\n\nShould I put those 4 months I was working there in my resume?\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the award guys!!! That's awesome!! And thank you all for your time to answer !!!",

    "text": "Advice for negotiating salary? Potential employer offered dream job but it's two jobs in one, and they want to pay me less for it (Sorry if this doesn't belong here, it has to do with a CS job, but it's mostly about negotiating salary)\n\nI quit my job doing security in April, and am currently doing food delivery gigs to save for college and pay bills while studying CS and programming. It pays enough for me to live on, but not enough to save for emergencies, so I applied for a refrigeration tech job offering $18/hr (I used to do HVAC) and it definitely seemed to go well over the two phone interviews. \n\nThe second interview, the hiring manager asked me about the coding experience I listed on my resume. I told him the truth, I'm just a student. He said that's fine; apparently they've been doing all the parts ordering and tracking on paper and need someone to come in and automate the process. He asked me if I was interested and I said yes, so he said he'd talk it over with his boss and if my next interview goes well, they'll create a position for me, where I would be in an office, programming most of the time, and acting as a refrigeration tech helper the rest of the time. (Presumably, I would finish the program and then move on to being a full time refrigeration tech)\n\nThis would be ideal for me. I love working with my hands, I love problem solving, I love working with computers, and I feel this would be a great stepping stone towards a career in programming.\n\nMy one hang up is this- the guy said they probably wouldn't be paying me $18/hour, \"since this is a whole new position.\" He doesn't know how much less, for the same reason. Honestly, anything $15 or above is great, and since I'm only a programming *student*+only worked HVAC for 6 months, I kind of get it. But it's still two jobs for less pay. Even if they pay me $18/hr for both, that's still less than they'd be paying for one refrigeration tech helper and one programmer. The way he talked about the backlog, it sounds like they really need someone to come in and sort it out, too.\n\nI feel like I could definitely negotiate a higher wage. The only problem is, I have no idea how without coming across as greedy or rude or arrogant. I've never negotiated salary before. I've worked as a carny, a hostess, a retail employee, a HVAC tech, and a security guard. I've never worked in an office or white collar environment before 😅 so any advice y'all have would be great, even if that advice is telling me I'm actually asking too much based on my experience level.\n\nTD;LR: Applied for a job working as a refrigeration tech, they saw my coding experience on my resume and offered me a dual job as a programmer and a refrigeration tech helper, but for less pay than the $18/hr working *just* as a refrigeration tech. It sounds like they very much need a programmer to help them automate a process or two, and even at 18/hr they'd be paying me less than one programmer and one tech helper, so between that and the working-two-jobs thing, I feel like I could get more pay, even though I'm inexperienced as both a programmer and a refrigeration tech.",

    "text": "How do you handle rejection from a potentially life-changing job opportunity? So I recently made the decision to look for a new job. I'm a Software Engineering Manager in Canada and my LinkedIn profile is pretty solid. A recruiter from a Silicon Valley startup in hyper-growth mode reached out to see if I'd be interested in exploring an Engineering Manager opportunity with them. I agreed and found out that the work was right up my alley (dev tool development and building a React component library, similar to Material UI - both things I have past experience with). The hiring manager (Senior EM) specifically picked me on LinkedIn because my past experience aligned really well with what they needed, and after meeting him it sounded like a great fit. He told me they would basically give me the \"white glove treatment\" and it all sounded great.\n\nNext up was the meeting with the recruiter about salary expectations, but instead of asking me what my expectations were, she told me what they were offering. When I found out how much they were offering, my jaw hit the floor. It was a life-changing amount of money - like triple my current yearly income - while also being fully remote. It almost sounded too good to be true, but of course I agreed to proceed with the interviews. However, I was also interviewing with other companies during this time as well, and the next day I had an offer from another company that was basically on par with my current income, but had much better career growth potential and more interesting work. I let the first company know that I had another offer on the table and asked if it would be possible to expedite the interview process since I didn't want to reject my current offer as it was still a good opportunity (and would get me out of my current job, where I'm bored and miserable).\n\nThe next day, the recruiter did exactly that and got the full interview panel lined up over the following 2 days. She called me up and literally told me exactly how the interviews would play out and what questions I would be asked so that I could prepare. Unfortunately the hiring manager I met earlier was on PTO that week, so he wouldn't be part of the interview panel. I took the interview super seriously, got in touch with my mentor to run through the questions to understand how best to answer them, and I spent hours prepping. I had 5 interviews lined up - People Management, Execution, Product Management, Systems Design, and Hiring Manager. Every interview went down exactly as the recruiter said they would and I had great conversations with everyone. It all seemed to go very well... except for the Systems Design one. I prepared for something very different than the challenge that was actually provided to me, which threw me off guard. I thought I did okay, all things considered, but I was being interviewed by a Staff Engineer who had me design a full back end architecture for something I had never done before (and my experience and passion is more on the Front End side of things).\n\nThe next morning, the interview panel met to debrief, and then the recruiter called me to let me know that the panelists all really liked me, but ultimately they would not be extending me an offer. Sounded like a few of my answers didn't quite hit the mark (in retrospect, I realized at least one of my answers could have been presented much better), and the Systems Design portion didn't hit home. I thanked her and expressed genuine gratitude for the opportunity, but also let her know that the Systems Design portion threw me off guard and that it was very different than what she said it would be. She apologized and said that wasn't supposed to happen and she would take that feedback back to the panelist. I emailed the original Hiring Manager and thanked him as well for the opportunity and that it was a shame we won't get to work together. I've now signed the contract with the other offer and will move forward with that one.\n\nSo here's the thing. I almost wish they didn't tell me how much the job was offering, because thinking about that kind of life-changing income (I could be debt free in 3 months instead of 3 years, I could actually buy a house in this ridiculous housing market, etc) added a lot of pressure and makes the sting of losing this opportunity that much more painful. I've never heard of any company offering that much income outside of maybe Facebook, while also being a job that aligns so well with my skillset, while working with really smart and capable people.\n\nAre those kinds of opportunities as rare as I think they are or were they simply out of reach before the pandemic (since now so many companies are going remote first)? Is this just a bump in the road and jobs like this could come again in the future, or have I missed out on something amazing that may not come again? How do I find opportunities like this again and how do I make sure not to let them slip through my fingers again?",

    "text": "Losing My Job - Not Sure What To Do Next Hey All,\n\nTLDR; I'm a mid-30s developer with no degree and a few (collective) years of \"decent\" experience. I'm losing my current Front End Development role.  Not sure what to do next.  Imposter Syndrome and bad interviews are killing me! Should I hang up my hat and learn how to make a flat white?\n\nSorry in advance for the loooong post of thought diarrhea below.. And also thank you in advance if you happen to read it!\n\nI am currently going through a career change crisis filled with Imposter Syndrome, anxiety attacks, past decision regrets and full-blown man tears. I'm my mid 30s and still don't know what I wanna be when I grow up.\n\nAny advice anyone is willing to provide, is beyond appreciated. This is just my desperate attempt to gain some perspective and insight.\n\n**My Current Situation**\n\nI'm currently working as a Front End Engineer. A few months ago I was told that my position, along with my U.S. team mates' positions, will be ending on Sept 31st and moved to Europe for cost saving purposes. When I found out, I immediately started trying to fill in knowledge gaps that I know I have including: Data Structures/Algorithms, Leetcoding, deep diving into JavaScript, React, Etc. I've continued to spend at least a couple hours a day bouncing between subjects to make some progress in each. I also went through a few interviews right away (that went horribly).\n\nThe good part about this situation is that I was given a good amount of notice and they will also be giving me about 5 months of severance pay if I stay until the end\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Background**\n\n**Company B: (2015-Current) \\~ 6 years**\n\nFor the past 2+ years, I’ve been doing full-time Front End Development on a small/new team. I transferred to this role internally from a more client-facing role - helping integrate them into our system as a technical point of contact. This role required a bit of development, but mostly small functions in JS/Python. I should mention that in my current role, I think I'm being paid more than I should be. This is because I was being paid a decent salary when I was in the client facing role (which I believe I was very good at), and when I moved to the FE Dev role, the company kept me at the same bracket - which is more of a senior level pay (at least for this company).\n\n**Company A: (2009-2015) \\~ 6 years**\n\nMy first I guess “career” job was as a help desk specialist. Soon into doing help desk, I started working on server/networking projects that I enjoyed more. Through this, I started to pick up some frontend dev projects (with Sharepoint at first) and found I had a real passion for it. It was basically me, my manager and one other Helpdesk person, so I started to create my own frontend/general dev projects so I could really focus on that more. This is around the time I was also taking some classes.\n\n**Education:**\n\nI was going for a CS degree in my early 20s. I dropped out after \\~ 30 credits due to personal reasons (crippling anxiety and financial reasons). I felt, at the time, that what I was learning at my job was more valuable. I've been on my own since I was 17, so making a full time salary was more important to me then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are a couple of issues that I currently see with myself:\n\n**Quality/Lack of Experience**\n\nIn most of my experience as a developer, I haven’t been surrounded by “Senior” level devs that I can normally bounce ideas off of and learn from. Though I think you can still become a good developer without this dynamic, I think this has greatly slowed down my progress. I've mostly missed out on teams that have rigorous, or even generally thorough code review processes and/or pair programming, etc.\n\n**Lack of Education**\n\nThis, of course, isn’t always a requirement from companies - and in fact, seems to be less and less required. But, I think it definitely  1. kept me from progressing at a faster pace (even though I was learning the “fun” stuff in the beginning) and 2. gives candidates, that I may be up against, an edge on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know Imposter Syndrome is a wide-spread issue in the developer community. But the 2 points above often leave me feeling inadequate and misplaced.\n\nI've had several interviews over the last few months.  Most of them weren't good.  I tend to freeze up and can't think of an algorithm during coding interviews. A mixture of needing more practice and anxiety completely taking over my thinking abilities. \n\nI try to super transparent and up front with recruiters to tell them my level, that I consider myself a junior to mid level developer.  But it seems that every time I've been put forward, they're looking for a senior instead. The one series of interviews (5 hours worth) I managed to do pretty decent on came back as rejection saying they were looking for a senior person - when me not being senior was my first discussion with the recruiter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe way I see it is I have a few options in front of me:\n\n**Option 1:**\n\nStay at my current company and transfer back to a client-facing role. \n\nPros: lack of stress about finding a job right away, continued salary that I'm happy with\n\nCons: isn't what I want to be doing, would lose my severance pay - and with that the opportunity to use that money to take time to find new opportunities, staying with a company that I feel burned\n\n**Option 2:** \n\nLeave my current company, take the severance and hope to find a good Front End/Full Stack position before my money runs out.  Spend all day going through courses, Leetcode problems, and interviewing. \n\nPros: I'll better my chances of finding something by having the time to fully focus on interviewing/etc. \n\nCons: It will be a completely anxiety-filled time.  The \"survivor\" in me that has managed to pay his own bills since barely 17 is pretty terrified at the idea of no income. And obviously no guarantee of landing a good gig. Interviewing is soul crushing. \n\n**Option 3:**\n\nTry freelancing. \n\nPros: No more interviews from dudes 10 yrs younger than me making me feel like a fraud! Be my own boss with flexible work schedule\n\nCons: There would be a big learning curve as this would be new to me, fluctuating income\n\n**Option 4:** \n\nInvest time and $$ into education.  Either a CS degree or coding bootcamp.\n\nPros: Potential knowledge gap reduction, networking, job placement, possibly more attractive to employers\n\nCons: A bunch of the knowledge may be too elementary and a silly use of time/money, time - if it's a degree I MIGHT still be under 40 by the time I finish, money - Neither option is cheap and I would have to figure out how to pay my New York City rent at the same time\n\n**Option 5:**\n\nChange careers. Maybe a Barista?  I could make a mean latte I'm sure. Maybe it would be easier than solving a Sudoku puzzle with backtracking recursion?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe truth is, I've loved developing.  I have a passion for frontend and learning new technologies.  I'm a creative person, so it's a perfect intersection for technical and creative skills. I feel like I have some decent skills already and could really flourish and shine if given the right opportunity. I'm just a bit lost now and would love some feedback/opinions from others who might know wtf they're doing and talking about or have maybe been in a similar boat. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for reading!",

    "text": "Why do I feel like every senior engineer that I’ve worked with have common and specific flaws? I was hired as a entry leveled software engineer at my current company about a year ago. My project has iterated through a few senior-leveled software engineers who I try to absorb as much as I’m able to. They all seem really experienced and bright but I’ve noticed a similar theme with the habits or mistakes my team members continue to make. The first similarity I’ve noticed is they all like to rush through their stories. This is made obvious by the amount of missed requirements or bugs that they continue to produce. There’s no thoroughness at all. They focus on architecting a clean solution, not a right solution. More bugs have been produced by my senior-leveled colleagues than features. Secondly they each like to try to either incorporate or enforce processes that they  were accustomed to at their old place. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but their ideas tend to not take into consideration the small team size, deadlines and tight budget our product is in. I completely think management in my company has created an environment where efficiency is valued more than quality, so the development team was made to cut corners. My Senior-leveled colleagues all seem to hate it and push for change, but they only seem to be bumping heads with management. I’m still new in this field so I’ve personally haven’t experienced the affects of doing things one way or another, so I’ve yet to whiteness the disasters that they’ve seen. Lastly, they all like to play hero. They like to take on more work than they can handle, and their stuff tends to carry over. It’s ok to trust someone with less experience than you. I’ve managed without you, I can get stuff done. My observations are a bit shallow and generalized. I also have nothing but respect for my coworkers, however I always wonder if there is a trade off with more experienced coworker",

    "text": "Choke during live code I am among the lucky few who managed to land a job at a major tech giant without ever having to demonstrate that I knew how to code. Well, that’s not exactly right, I did a white boarding session during my interview gauntlet, but code on whiteboards carry with them several grains of salt. Besides, I was interviewing as a Systems Engineer, so the code bar was pretty low to begin with. \n\nFast forward 4 years and now I am a full-blown highly regarded Software Development Engineer, one who is consistently ranked among the top 10% of engineers. I never took a single CS class. Never did well in maths. Couldn’t tell you a binary tree from a depth first algorithm, but I write code that’s clear, effective, and efficient. I stumble upon working methods I guess.\n\nToday I had a phone screen with an equally large tech giant, and as is the standard now, it involved a live coding session. The challenge was pretty simple, easier than the ones I usually present in the 200+ interviews I’ve conducted in the past. The interviewer asked me to explain, before diving in, what my algorithm would be. I explained my approach and he asked me if it was [insert CS term here] approach. I said “uh… yeah, I guess it is.” Then I realized I can’t code when someone is watching. I got as far as writing the word `class` and then blanked. I hung up. I closed my browser, and I didn’t answer when they called me back.\n\nHow am I ever going to find employment elsewhere? I doubt I could show anyone that I know what I am doing at this point.",

    "text": "[Rant - Bad words used] Are new hires/interns supposed to be this stupid? Initiating Rant in 3...2...1...\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHoly fucking shit, last senior left alive at the firm and in charge of making sure all these new hires/interns know what the fuck they are doing while reviewing some their work. I handle the majority of their questions while the manager reviews the reconciliations and financial statements. I am always available whenever they have questions and try to help them as best as I can. I usually spend about half of my day instructing them and reviewing their work while providing constructive feedback on any issues. I have never yelled or cussed in front of them since I feel as though that's a dumb fucking way to teach someone (had a manager who would constantly yell at me for dumb shit and I always though he was the stupid fucking prick to ever have existed).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI have been training the majority of these fuckwads since September and they are still making the same mistakes they made during their first week here and I'm not talking about newbie mistakes. I literally just had one who apparently has accounting experience call me and ask how do they reconcile an account they were supposed to be reconciling since October (manager waited until today to review this account). When I asked them to provide me their notes they have been taking since October they sent me over 50 pages of chicken shit that's barley legible. The sad part is this isn't even the worst of the worst, see below for more issues. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#1. It took me 3 months to get the concept of a debit and credit to the mentioned employee above and they still ask me to verify if they are \"debiting\" the right accounts from time to time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#2. A different new hire called me on my personal phone at 2 in the morning to discuss a hypothetical situation they had and wanted to get my input as to whether or not their line of reasoning on resolving it was correct. After listening to them explain it for about 20 minutes I turned off my phone and went back to bed. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#3. New hire picked up the phone for one of our major clients (that only I handle) and started telling them that they are going to be the new point of contact since they were going to handle all of the work for them. I only asked them to enter in some checks... It took me 30 minutes to calm the client down and to take away the new hire's phone.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#4. An intern was supposed to organize receipts for items purchased with cash via an excel spreadsheet and for some reason they duplicated a lot of the receipts. Instead of totaling around $1.5k the end result was $4k. After going over the issue with them and making sure they understood the process (enter one in, verify the number, put to the side, enter new one in, verify the number, put to the side, do this until the pile is gone) they still managed to mess it up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#5. While I was in a meeting with some of the partners and my manager to discuss bullshit budgeting shit an intern walked in to tell me their computer was broken and wasn't turning on and that they were going to need a new one and that they had already spent around 30 minutes looking on their phone for a better one and that this one they found was perfect and for the cost it was a total steal and that and that and that and thoagofhgaokojafdshojadfohkjadofhjao. After going to their desk and spending about 15 seconds looking at their shit it turns out they accidentally kicked the power cord and it detached from the back of the desktop.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#6. New hire needed to print something out and didn't know their computer was connected to the \"community printer\" (backup printer we have in case our personal printer is down). Proceeded to print out around 200+ pages of bullshit to test and see why it wasn't printing from his work station. One of the partners was the one to discover this and ended up throwing a fit because all of the wasted paper and ink.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#7. An older client brought us some paper documents we needed to scan into our database and for some unknown fucking reason when my manager asked an intern to scan and bring it back so the client can keep the originals the intern scanned it, placed it in the wrong online folder, and then shredded the documents. I still cringe about how my manager had to have the client wait while he located the documents, then came back to the client with black and white photocopies of the documents they just fucking gave us and having to explain what happened.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI loathe to think of how badly this fucking busy season is going to be. The only thing keeping me sane is the fact that whether or not they extend the tax deadline past April I will be quitting regardless.",

    "text": "Weird/Funny Accountant Stories Not sure what prompted this post but as we all know our industry (probably a bit more than most) attracts the occasional weird, awkward, odd, etc... people. With that being said, what are some weird or awkward stories that you have come across in the working world? It could be one incident or a string of them done by one or more people. I have a slow day at work and would love to hear what people have experienced. I'll start off with a few of mine in my 8+ years as an Accountant that for whatever reason, I still think of to this day.\n\n**Epic Misclick**\n\nThere was one individual that I worked with that had an extreme form of anxiety. He was a great guy but because of how nervous and \"shaky\" he was, it was always a bit awkward talking to him. Anyways, one time he asked me for help on a particular Excel issue. I told him that it would be easier if we went to his desk so we can diagnose it better. Before this, his nerves never really showed as much when he was at his desk working on something aside from the occasional random clicking. But for whatever reason, this time his anxiety was a lot higher and in the middle of me explaining how to resolve the issue, he exited out of his spreadsheet, hit the windows button, and restarted his computer. It was a series of nervous and very unfortunate misclicks. I don't quite remember what I said when he did it. I think I just laughed nervously and said something like \"That happens to me sometimes as well\" or whatever. But regardless, the next 5 minutes was just awkward silence as we waited for his computer to boot up so I can finish explaining the Excel problem.\n\n**The Ghost Twin**\n\nFor one of my first accounting jobs, I was hired as part of a major acquisition along with a group of 9-10 other new hires. Since the company was still in the process of re-locating, there wasn't enough space for all of us so they put every new hire inside one room with rows of tables where our computers were (Think of my office as a classroom type setting). Because of this, everyone got to know each other very well, except for one particular individual. This guy was extremely shy and would barely talk to anyone. He spent most of his leisure time at work doing chess puzzles. \n\nAnyways, during one of our initial ice-breakers as a group, I mentioned to everyone that I had an identical twin brother. Naturally, this always causes a lot of random stereotypical questions (Which one is the evil twin, etc..) but after we got through it, me having a twin became a random talking point every now and then. Over half a year went by and a lot of the people in the room knew my twin brother very well because I always talked about him and since it's rather unique, people asked a lot of questions too. Eight months into the job, our manager went around the room and asked each of us what we were doing for the Christmas holidays. When it got to chess guy, he answered that he would be hanging out with his brother. After someone asked him if it was an older or younger brother, he came out and said that it was his identical twin.\n\nIt's hard to explain the awkward silence from everyone after unless you were there but imagine 6+ months of conversations that featured a twin while someone that also had a twin was just listening in (in the same room) without ever bringing that fact up.\n\n**Bonus: Banana Dude**\n\nOne of my former cubical neighbors would always bring 5 bananas to work every morning, peel all the bananas right from the start, stack them in a pyramid formation, and then eat from the pyramid pile throughout the day. I never got to ask him why he did it or why he ate so many bananas a day but I hope he's doing well now.  \n\n**Additional Bonus (Myself)**\n\nTo not let myself off the hook, I will share one of mine. Early on in my career I had a weird habit of lying when in an awkward conversation setting (Think Jonah Hill from Wolf of Walstreet). Usually they were small white lies and no one really noticed but there was one situation that still haunts me to this day and the conversation went something like this:\n\nSupervisor: \"Where did you get those chips. I wanted to grab something quick since today is a half day?\"\n\nMe: \"I ran down to the cafeteria this morning.\" (A complete lie but for whatever reason, I was more comfortable saying that vs. saying that I brought them from home)\n\n\\*Now this is an example of a white lie that I would have easily gotten away with except for the fact that it was Good Friday and the cafeteria was closed that day. I didn't realize it as it didn't occur to me in the moment that it was a holiday and the cafeteria is still open on some holidays. The supervisor didn't realize it either and actually went downstairs, saw that it was closed, came back up and let me know that it's closed. I think I blocked the rest of the conversation from my memory but I believe that I nervously laughed and said something like \"Oh really?\" Either way, it was a sleepless night that night.",

    "text": "Falsely accused of stealing while at work Hello guys (TLDR at the bottom) . I'm in need of advice! I'm in a very tough situation. On Saturday I was falsely accused of stealing while working. I work at a retail store that sells clothes, makeup accessories etc. I've been working at this specific location for 4 months but worked for this company for 3 years as a whole. While I was working I was called over by one of my managers. She told me Alice  (another manager) and her wanted to have a word with me. I also want to note that Alice seemed very mad at me and I had noticed her watching me during that shift that day. (Both managers are asian) \n\nThey told me to follow them and took me to a private room. I had no idea what they pulled me over for. They both stood there in front of me and Sharon the one that called me over told me to empty out my pockets. I was a bit shocked. I followed as was said and emptied out my pockets. I showed them that my front and back pockets pockets were empty apart from the NYX lipstick I had in my pocket (one I was wearing that day) . They both seemed a bit surprised. They seemed to of expected for me to of stolen a lipstick from their company. (Which btw is literally sold for £1 so why would I bother stealing their low quality makeup? I don't own a single makeup product from the company I work at) . \n\nSharon then said \"Oh! Well Alice said she saw you put something from the makeup department into your pocket while doing the returns (putting clothes/ items back onto the shop floor) . Alice seemed extremely embarrassed I see her turning red. She was very quiet the whole time. I feel like if you have the guts to make such a big accusation you should have the guts to be the one saying it!\n\nSharon then had the audacity to ask me \"Do you know where to put the items when doing returns?\" \"Yes, I put them back onto the shop floor...\" such a dumb question asking as if the n*gga chip inside of me would suddenly activate and cause for me to steal. I've been returning clothes onto the shop floor for months with no issues for months!\n\nWhat really grinded my gears was that Sharon ended things saying \"Well, next time just make sure to not put that in your pocket incase it causes another misunderstanding\" . Basically making it seem like I caused this \"misunderstanding\" and projecting the blame onto me instead admitting THEY were in the wrong. When they falsely accused me! I just ended things saying that I've gotta go to my break.\n\nThis situation has left me feeling so upset and angry. Everytime I as a black person walk into a store I worry about people thinking I'm going to steal. I worry about the most innocent actions I make may be perceived as being suspicious. I worry about potentionally being falsely accused of stealing and that's EXACTLY what happened today. I never thought that I'd have to worry about this at a place I worked at. \n\nI talked to 5 other people and they quickly said racism and felt like race played a part in this accusation. I talked to 4 other black people and 1 Asian guy. I just don't know what to do. I feel saddened especially since I wasn't even given the benefit of the doubt. There is literally nothing about me, my character, my work ethic, the way I dress that would've ever indicated that I was the type of person to steal. Nothing apart from the fact that I'm black. I can't help but wonder what if it was a white coworker doing the same thing? Would anyone's mind quickly jump to stealing? Or would it of just been brushed aside and given the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI know some people will say this has nothing to do with race but black people are constantly being falsely accused of stealing! We're more likely to be falsely accused of stealing something that turned out to be our own belongings. What do you guys think? Do you think race potentionally played a part in influencing this assumption? I know that people have unconscious racial biases/stereotypes ingrained in them that influences how they see black people that they may not be consciously aware of.\n\nI saw Alice on the shop floor afterwards and she has not said a word to me since. Sharon tried to awkwardly sweep things under the rug by doing her job and giving me orders to do as normal. Neither have apologised.\n\nWhat would you do if you were in my position? Would you quit or keep going to work and move on? I already hated this job before this situation happened. They overwork us, always understaffed and the pay is only minimum wage. The only thing that I like about the job are the people I work with. I enjoy talking to them while I'm there. However this situation has left me in tears for days and feeling very uncomfortable.\n\nTLDR; Got accused of stealing at work by 2 Asian female managers at work. Called me me to empty out my pockets only to find out they were wrong and have since not apologised and have attempted to sweep things under the rug by acting normal and projecting the blame onto me.",

    "text": "PSA: Document everything and ask for things in writing. As black women in the workforce it’s not news to anyone here that management will almost always try to try us. Long story short, new white lady department manager started at my old job and decided she didn’t like me from day 1. She tried to gaslight me into thinking I had “automatically resigned” from my position by completing an internal interview for a different department. I asked for a termination letter which deaded that real quick. After that debacle I took the hint, looked for and found a better job that pays significantly more, and tendered my resignation. This woman decided she couldn’t leave well enough alone, so she pulled me into the office halfway through my notice period and told me it’s best for us to “part ways here” and that she would pay me for my remaining scheduled hours. Say less, BYE! 👋🏾\n\nOf course I didn’t trust her so I sent her a recap email immediately after the discussion, pointedly thanking her for promising me severance. No response. Fast forward to payday and—predictably—nothing hits my account. I keep it cool (could be an honest oversight), reach out to HR to try and get it sorted out. I’m not there anymore nor privy to what was said but I’m assuming she tried to tell them she didn’t know what I was talking about because they kept trying to avoid my emails and phone calls for over a week. That was until I called the Head of Accounting, explained the situation to him and softly threatened legal action. Immediately after the phone call I forwarded the recap email I had sent my former manager to both him and HR. Three hours after that, they said that they would pay me for the hours AND my unused accrued PTO that previously they had told me I wasn’t entitled to per their PTO payout policy (hadn’t worked there long enough to qualify for payout).\n\nTL;DR Management are not your friends, *especially* not if you’re a black woman. Verbal threats and promises mean nothing. If they are doing anything “official” with regards to you and not documenting it, it’s because it is in their best interest not to do so.

Today was the first time I’ve ever asked for a raise at a job! \nI’m the only Black person at my job (really small staff) and and after getting to know our newest hire (white woman) and asking how much she made, I found out she made more than me -lmao huh? \n\nI work a part time job at my local museum, and have been picking up more work since my immediate supervisor left a couple of weeks ago. Felt it was time to negotiate because I know for a fact if I left tomorrow they would be screwed - not the most professional take but crucial information nonetheless. \n\nMy boss made it seem like pulling teeth (kept interrupting me, was a little dismissive at first) but I pushed through and managed to make my points and stand my ground! \n\nThe raise wasn’t much, but it will definitely make a difference! \n\nI feel so proud!",

    "text": "Only black person with 3 white roommates; I knew this wasn’t going to end well… **TL;DR: I got placed with 3 white girls who have formed some kind of clique and often exclude me. I found out at least one is an anti vaxx super conservative republican and it’s freaking me out/ making me concerned for my safety**\n\n\nFor context we’re in college and live in an off campus apartment. They typically do roommate matching since this is a college town; we all have the same/similar majors which is why I assume they were matched with me however it is extremely common for those in my major to be very cliquey.\n\n\nSo they moved in last week, I’ve lived in this particular apartment for 2 years. Girl A seemed generally nice when she came in and I was confused bc I’d apparently been sent the wrong roommate list. She showed me her phone and said “you’re Proper right? Unit 13?” I told her it was me that explains why the other girls I had matched with weren’t responding to any of my messages and how I generally thought it’s a huge red flag & rude when people won’t speak to their matches because it always becomes a huge issue later. She had initially made it seem like a last minute match switch but then she admitted they (her & the other 2 girls) had been talking for a while but they were friends of friends. I said it’s not a big deal and carried on with my business.\n\n\nLater that day and the next morning B and C moved in and they were noticeably cold. B was setting up her room with her family and I decided to walk over to introduce myself. “Hi, I’m Proper! It’s nice to meet you, I’ll be one of your roommates. So what’s your name?” They looked up and silently stared before I asked again, got an answer and I awkwardly went back to my room. The exact same thing happened when C moved in except her family seemed slightly more open to small talk.\n\n\nAbout a week has gone by and I’m annoyed at their nasty dirty habits but otherwise fine. I did catch C going through my things in the bathroom to see “what’s mine and yours” there’s a divider down the middle of the cabinet, there’s no need to won\n\n\nSo earlier today me and A were home alone. Somehow the issue of pet policy came up and I mentioned wanted to get my dog signed off on as an ESA however my old apartment turned me down. She tried to argue that ESAs have no rights and I informed her that according to the ADA fair housing act they cannot be denied housing but they do not have public access rights the last time I had done the research. It’s just a google search away however sometimes the laws get muddy in our little college town because the university has so much influence over it. \n\n\nFor some reason she exclaimed how she hated stupid liberals and they ruin everything for everyone. I just said “wow” because it literally came out of nowhere. She then said “wait are you a liberal?” I told her I don’t necessarily identify as liberal but under no circumstances am I a conservative. She told me she was 100% conservative republican and that she was upset the university was requiring she get tested once per week because she isn’t vaxxed. I told her that I was vaxxed and I understand being skeptical however for me personally I’ve already gotten permanent damage from previously getting infected so there’s nothing about a vaccine that’s going to scare me. She then went on a long rant about how people are being kicked out of housing over vaccines (literally what??) jobs were firing nurses and private institutions were kicking out students (then go somewhere public tf). She wouldn’t let me get a single word in and kept bringing up points I hadn’t even made.\n\n\n> “Oh so you wore a mask and still got sick? Shocking, studies show particles still get through a mask” \n\n\n> yes of course things can travel through a mask however the point of a mask is to protect others around me, not to protect myself so what was your point? I managed not to infect any of my contacts with a mask on but why does it matter anyway if wearing one makes me comfortable\n\n\n>well I never wore a mask anywhere unless they forced me to! (Oh so you’re a Karen) You know vaxxed people are still getting infected\n\n\n>yes Ik how vaccines work and you should too going into medicine. Literally no vax is 100% but last I heard the hospital reported that 95% of their covid patients were unvaxxed. It reduces risk, it’s not foolproof\n\n\nI kept trying to back out of the convo\n> “look, you have your opinions and I have mine. I think you should be vaccinated but there’s nothing I could do to force you. Most of my family made the same decision. Y’all are within your rights but it simply isn’t something I agree with and if there are consequences to our choices so be it. I made the best choice for me” \n\n\nand she kept going…I said this exact thing like 5 times and she kept going before getting mad and simply ignoring me on her phone like a child. I was so ready to pop her in the mouth y’all; pray for me because idk what to do. Especially because she’s been walking around all week coughing and I was worried because I’ve been having a lot of the same issues I had the first time I got sick, I guess I got my answer.",

    "text": "Making Black Female Friends Has anyone else had trouble/issues making Black female friends as a Black woman? \n\nI really didn't have as much of a hard time with it until late high school, despite growing up in yt areas. I've been used to being the only Black person or one of the few Black people in my majority yt school. When I would try to befriend the other Black kids in my AP classes, who I'm thinking are probably going through the same things I am, they *hated* me and bullied me for allegedly thinking I was \"better\" than them, being \"uppity\" or that I was \"trying to be white\" because of how I spoke. One girl actually tried to pull my hair once. Another girl I almost got into a fight with because I was tired of how she treated me. I ended up having more yt friends and best friends as they seemed to be more welcoming of me, but of course, there's still that level of distance and danger that's there because they don't fully understand your experiences and many of them came from ultra conservative households-- so I was hyper aware that I was the \"Black exception\" friend instead of \"Sally's friend.\"\n\nI have found even in the workplace it's not that much better-- the only Black (female) supervisors I've had made my life hell because I wasn't from the same side of town as them and made low key hateful comments about my interests or the clothes I wore (a mix of things from Target, LOFT or some J. Crew, but just general professional attire) or a bag I wore. They would play games with me and mess with my time off pay to force me to either work during the time I requested off or make me go unpaid because I \"could afford it\" when they didn't know my budget or finances. They'd block me from mentorships and opportunities within the company but also hated that the (largely mediocre and unimpressive) yt coworkers were friendly with me. It's not like these women weren't educated or accomplished; they were in middle management positions and they went to school. So I chalked it up to nasty crabs in a bucket mentality and left. \n\nA lot of these behaviors seems to translate in social situations too-- there's the lowkey comments about me being \"rich\" or being a \"valley girl\" or about the way I dress or what I wear and how I speak. (Pre pandemic) I would go to women's meetups and hangouts and would open myself up to talking to the Black ladies there-- like literally flock to them because hey! we out here! And they'd.... kind of dismiss me for various arbitrary reasons. Same with trying to join a grad chapter for a sorority. I don't know what it is there to prove that I'm unambiguously Black and interested in them but I feel like the onus is largely on me to prove that to be accepted when I'm just being myself.\n\nOn the other hand, I do find it quite curious though, that my older sister and I grew up in the same environment for the most part, speak the same, and she dresses in designer threads. But she's always had predominately Black friends or POC friends as well as boyfriends, whereas mine have been more yt leaning. I feel like she's more grounded in her Blackness and I'm working on it because it's like...yes, I love indie rock music and concerts, ballet dancing, hiking, insert whatever stereotypical yt hobby etc. and have relaxed hair (just like my sister) but I was still raised in an all Black family with Black parents  with Black culture and history that I love and embrace. Even without all of that, I'm still a Black woman living a Black experience.\n\nTL;DR On one hand, I feel like I am \"not Black enough\" for the Black women I've encountered/tried to befriend, and they become very vicious with me because they find my hobbies, the way I speak, how I look etc. to be \"yt pandering\" or \"uppity\" yet it's not always comforting or mutual to have yt friends either because, at least in my experience, they don't even try to understand my cultural experiences. I also am straight up done with being/feeling like a token. While we may share the same hobbies and interests, my yt friends have been openly dismissive of how I and other Black people are treated in society. I have learned over so many times how dangerous it is to have close yt friends and have accepted that but at the same time, I don't want to give up on my community either. Not sure what is the deal?",

    "text": "It is so validating to confirm my experience of living in one of the most racist gaslighting states (Minnesota) It is so validating to confirm my experience of living in one of the most racist gaslighting states (Minnesota)\n\nI just saw this picture showing Minnesota is one of the most racist states in the country---so validating (see link below). I knew MN racism was really bad at my core but you get gaslighted so much here that you start questioning your reality. People act like there is no racism here because \"people are so nice.\" White fragility is real here... like narcissists, white people act racist, deny it, make themselves the victims, then put the blame on you. They are so passive aggressive that the racism is so subtle, ex: moving away from you out of fear like you are this big threat. I am a woman and I've learned to keep a lot of physical distance from white women and to not make eye contact---which by the way, is super offensive as a feminine woman. If you aren't going out of your way to be super friendly and make them comfortable, you are a threat. I have had my own white relatives act suspicious of me for visiting and trying to get to know  them. I have always felt so isolated being a higher educated middle class black mixed woman. I've been treated as a criminal by my own employers. One time I walked into my first therapy job and the co-workers spoke to my white supervisor instead of me---they were so shocked and uncomfortable when they found out I was the therapist. The social class and job discrimination is so strong here, they are shocked to see professional black people. Being around all this white supremacy makes you question yourself and internalize their messages... You question your sanity, if you are bad, the problem.. when really they are the problem. They have the history of stealing and killing all groups of people for centuries but somehow they see themselves as the victims. White narcissistic delusion.\n\nThere also isn't much of a community of black professionals. From my experience, there are a lot of black (especially mixed) people who are in denial and will gaslight you about racism, too. I have had a lot of bad experiences with mixed black people who are in denial of their blackness, talk about how they pass for other races, and allign with whiteness. They distance themselves from their blackness and some seem delusional because they do not see that they do look part black.\n\nIt seems like the black/mixed people who make it to the top are the ones who have assimilated, have internalized racism, are not unified with other black people, and have had to swallow the racism they have had to experienced. I could not do that for long without it eating me up. I spoke up for myself and others. As humans, we are not supposed to be abused and just take it.. but somehow as black people, white people see us as less than human and think we are immuned and should just take it.\n\nI am burnt out. I barely leave the house. White people are everywhere here and I don't trust most. When I am around them, I dissociate to avoid feeling the pain of all of their violent \"microaggressions.\" Thankfully for now, I work at a black business. Moving out of this state is mandatory for my sanity. I wish all black people could leave as well. It is hard to succeed and progress here without losing a part of yourself. At least I know I managed to survive (and suceeded educationally and built resiliency) one of the most racist states, it can only get better from here as I move on to a more equitable state.\n\n[Racial Disparity MN pic](https://www.zippia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/racial_disparity_map_worst_states.jpg)",

    "text": "Harassment at Work My Cousin (early 30s) was recently at her job by this older white guy (mid 50s). Mostly white workplace yet a few black coworkers she befriended and they come to her since she’s intelligent and people come to her type of way.\n\nMost of the times he would be the one to approach her to talk and gossip and at first it seemed like just talking with your coworkers. Then it became off as with how he tried to bring up discuss racial discussions. He said to not consider Black Americans her people (from Virgin Islands). Which was not his place to even say. He told her everyone has gone through things as he was Catholic and they were discriminated in the past.  He said in his own country he’s discriminated (although not even a recent immigrant...)\n\nThe breaking point was trying to address her as “my girl” and saying “my wife at work”. He would also turn conversations sexual...\n\nShe began ignoring him and distancing herself from him and then he approached her asking why she’s not talking to him.. She yelled at him to go.\n\nShe reported it to her manager and she designed her schedule so he wouldn’t have to come into contact with him. Though the manager was saying “Really?” as if he wouldn’t approach her sexually when she said what he said to her. The manager even said  Italians can be that way(???) and it may be a cultural thing. Like his parents may be immigrants why is that even a reflection off of him? And it’s Italian culture to overstep boundaries?\n\nI’m so mad I literally want to confront that man myself. Her assistant \n  manager never even said I’m sorry that happened to you or even addressed it like she doesnt\n gaf about her workers. The guy would even mess with this black guy at the job and deal with him differently. I feel like black women can be sexually harassed and no one would believe us because apparently no one want us. As if we’re not women.\n\n\nI changed details about age of cousin and this guy to not be explicit about their identities.",

    "text": "Feeling ugly and undesirable as a black woman. Hey everyone this is my first time posting on here and I'd like to ask for some advice. I'm a 25 year old black female going to school at a predominantly white college. I come from the Caribbean(Jamaica to be exact) where it's mostly black people and I'm having a really hard time making friends with other black people. It seems to me that the few black people who live in this neighborhood don't actually mess with other black folks especially the black men I come across. They tend to ignore you completely or if you speak to them they are very passive aggressive. I also noticed that when they speak they speak with a Caucasian American accent and for the most part every black guy I see only has white friends or they only date white women. I think this is kinda bizzare I'm not saying that people can't date who they want but it's so odd to see other unambiguous black people completely disassociate themselves from people who look like them. Idk how to explain how isolated I feel. \n     I do chemical engineering so my class is pretty much all white men I'm the only black woman in my class. There were 2 black guys in the class so I sat next to one of them hoping I could make friends. The teacher told everyone to partner up with the person next to you and he literally went out of his way to try to avoid me even though I was the one sitting closest to him. By the time I came to class the next time he had switched seats just to avoid me. I cant fully explained how worthless he made me feel. I was reading something on reddit where people were talking about an interview with Gabriel union. She said when she was young she would go out of her way to avoid other black people and only hang out with white girls. She said she didn't want to be looked down upon like the white girls looked down on black women so she would avoid them at all cost so she wouldn't be isolated by her white friends. This is the first time in my life I've ever come across black people who didn't like other black people. Don't get me wrong I don't expect you to be my new bff but at least don't treat me like I'm less than you. I feel like some of these black kids grew up in a predominantly white school so they don't have the same experience like other black people so they think they are above you or think racism is just all in your head. \n    My question is have any of you gone through this and do you have any advice for how to deal with microaggression from white people and having no solidarity with other black people. This morning I was driving to work and I saw a black girl in the car in front of me. When I looked on her bumper it was a ton of pro trump stickers......I feel like I'm in the Twilight zone cause nothing here makes sense. Btw I moved to Alabama without doing much research I was so happy to get accepted at a college that I didn't even think of the people there. Oh one last thing I was in the supermarket shopping for groceries a couple weeks ago there was a black guy with his white girlfriend standing in front of the milk I was waiting for them to move so I could grab a gallon for myself. And this dudes gf gave me the nastiest look when she saw me it was one of those looks like \"yah bitch Ik you're jealous of me\"....... But in actuality I not even mad he's with her neither do I have any desire for the guy she was with I was just trying to get some milk and they took forever to move... The black guys are passive aggressive and so are their gf's. I'm sorry this post is so long but I'm just so genuinely confused by it all. These days I feel so ugly and undesirable people having me feeling in some kinda monster people should avoid. This is my first time truly experience discrimination for my skin color so it's all so traumatizing idk how to manage it. 🥺 Please I need some help.",

    "text": "#WeArePeopleToo: A Proposal for a New Movement Hi everyone, this is my first post ever on Reddit despite being an avid Redditor. I apologize if I lack any specific Reddit-based decorum when it comes to making a post. I will definitely get better with time!\n\nMy name is Dae and I'm an NYC public school educator in my late 20s. I am a mixed race male and would like to share my story as well as establish my thoughts on a movement to better represent us as mixed-raced humans of the world.\n\n**My Story**\n\nI was born to a Trinidadian mother and a Korean father. As a result of their marriage, my father's side of the family became estranged and cut ties with us. As a result, I have only managed to forge a relationship with the Trinidadian side of my family. I grew up in a fairly Republican/Conservative area of NYC (Staten Island) in which white people were the majority.\n\nMy parents loved me but they had no idea how to deal with raising a multiracial son. They were stern and strict and did not believe in a coddling love. They did, however, believe in the merits of education and made sure that I knew to bring the best grades home. In school, other students stayed away from me. They were polite as young children but they often ostracized me and left me out of activities. At the time I didn't know it was because of how I looked but with time I began to see the relationship. I learned the power of being a fool, of being self-depreciating. As people laughed at me, I saw it as their acceptance. What I had actually done was prime them to note my difference, my mixed-race status, as being something comical, something to decry, deride, and deplore.\n\nI became the class clown and stood to make problems for the sake of other's entertainment. Teachers began to hate me and associate me as a problem child. They suggested mental and learning disabilities despite my high grades due to my parents and their iron fist approach to education. With every letter home, phone call, parent-teacher conference, I would receive a beating from my parents. Slaps in the face, beatings with belts, name calling, screaming in a child's face, bruises on my body. All done for the sake of being accepted by my peers. All for the sake of being loved by someone. I learned that people who love you are allowed to do whatever they want to your body so I let others do what they wanted to me. Friends treated me like a punching bag. At the age of 8 my 13 year-old babysitter blackmailed me into allowing her to rape me. I said nothing, scared more at the idea that I would be in trouble if people knew I had sex because I knew enough to know sex was wrong.\n\nBy the time I was 12 in middle school, I had tried to hurt myself for the first time. I was taken to the guidance counselor because I had told a friend who, doing the right thing, told an adult. In the process, I was treated like I was crazy. I was threatened to be committed because I was a danger to myself. All of this made me feel *different* and I already knew *different* was bad. I knew because of how I felt when people told me I was different. \"What are you?\" \"Who is black?\" \"How did that happen?\" \"Are you \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?\" The looks of confusion. Even worse was the looks of incredulity, like the fact that I existed couldn't be real. People, regardless of their own race, made me feel so ugly. Ugly because I was different, unique, and beautiful because of my uniqueness.\n\nI knew my parents' union was odd because people told me that. But I didn't know the history of miscegenation in America. I did not know that it was once a crime to be us or to engage in a union that results in the creation of one of us. What I did experience, however, was fetishization as I grew up and became sexually active again. I had a hard time finding someone who thought we had enough of a connection to date one another. When I did, I immediately agreed to date them, I was thirsty for love and affection. But this love was ugly too because it was different. This was even present in friendships. I had friends who told me they would only date black girls because they were black and wanted to have black babies. I had friends who told me I was smart because I was Asian and knew some rap and had rhythm because my mom was Black.\n\nMy girlfriends never, ever brought me home. I was a secret, forever to be hidden. I grew attached to a concept that white girls were the most beautiful. This was partially because of where I grew up but also out of jealousy. White people had such an ownership of their heritage. They knew what they were and forged relationships based on those identities. I wanted so badly to be white. I told my mother that I liked white girls and that in my next life I'd like to be white because they rule the world. My hatred of my blackness stemmed from the fact that society deemed black inferior which led me to believe that my blackness was probably why my interactions with society were so awful. If only I were fully Asian or White and had no blackness to me. I didn't realize it was just because I was mixed. The one girlfriend who took me home only told her family I was Asian. During the death of Eric Garner on Staten Island as racial tensions spilled out onto the streets, I visited her family and had to grimace as they joked about, \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\". She said nothing. She did nothing. I didn't expect her to.\n\nMy life spiraled out of control as I got older and race became more important as a qualifier in making connections with people. I fell in deep love with a girl from a family who practiced the Islamic faith. She had difficulties accepting her role in the religion and found solace in me, a person with no ties to any culture because my culture was so shattered by my being multiracial. She would often tell me how \"cool\" it was that I was Black and Asian. How \"attractive\" it was. I didn't know what she was doing was fetishizing me, I was desperate to believe she loved me. After a few years, the relationship fell apart and, again, it was because I was different. This time, however, I knew it was because of my race. I never hated myself so much in my life. I cursed myself and my family, I wished I could be one thing.\n\nI drank a lot after the breakup. I wanted to die. I woke up face down in the gutter one night after binge-drinking. I tried to slice my wrists in my backyard, then I tried to fall on the knife. I tried to jump off the overpass by my house into traffic. I wanted my death to be certain. I gained so much weight my heartbeat became erratic. I was smoking a pack a day and developed a wheeze. I hated myself, I needed to punish myself. I fought my father, I ran away from home and became homeless. I hurt and hurt and hurt because love seemed impossible because acceptance was impossible.\n\nI became a teacher. First in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn where my students, forever ready to curse me out and let me know when I wasn't being \"fair\", accepted me. Almost instantly. They asked what I was, were relieved when they heard \"Black\" because they knew we shared something common, and then made me one of their own. They joked with me, told me gossip, shared their fears, shared their dreams and their emotions. They asked me to share my stories and for the first time, **ever**, someone wanted to truly know me. Now I teach in the South Bronx where my students have yet to ask me what I am. Because it does not matter to them.\n\nI began a journey to heal. I lost weight though exercise, something I was so hesitant to do because I hated myself and wanted to die. I took a road trip from NY to Georgia, across to New Orleans, Louisiana then to Texas, then Cali. I got to see the Pacific Ocean and looked across to imagine my father's country. We drove back and I was refreshed with a new look on life. I educated myself on race relations in America as BLM became a massive presence following the death of George Floyd and learned to love my blackness. I attended my first protest on Staten Island with BLM and learned the importance of being outspoken. I learned to love myself and I learned how to share that love with others. I challenged my perceptions of education and decided to dedicate my life towards bringing a sense of ownership when it comes to science for BIPOC students. By providing students with a more hands-on experience, they learn that science is a gift for all humanity in the form of a community, one that it is honorable to be a part of. I have since been selected to work on a committee that brings more diversity toward l\n\n**The Movement**\n\nThrough my research, I have become extremely disillusioned with the lack of support provided to people of mixed race. I grew up with no one to turn to, no one to help me unpack the burden of being an oddity to society. I left social media, angry, vowing to never use it again because I didn't want to interact with a society that could not accept me. I likened it to being desperate, to chasing the desire to belong to something that has no desire to accept me.\n\nI fell upon Beverly Daniel Tatum's national bestseller, \"Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together In The Cafeteria?\" and noted that it was revised and updated. I had never had interest in reading this book before, despite it being mentioned in conversations with friends, teachers, etc. I did not belong to the black culture and so social issues of segregation were particularly damning to me. How could I sympathize with a culture that told me I wasn't black or black enough? At least they had one another in their culture to lean on. I had no one, I felt. In the revised edition, Dr. Tatum places attention to the role that Multiracial families bring to a discussion of race relations in America. Yet, in one fell swoop, she manages to disenfranchise me and other mixed-raced people, \"Given the unique historical and contemporary context, it is the biracial identity development of children of Black and White parents that I will focus on here.\" (Tatum, 304) I was not even enough to garner attention by a champion of Civil Rights and Equality in a book that was groundbreaking in its ability to unpack race relations in my country. I began to wonder how many other mixed-race people felt this way.\n\nI realized that we are under-represented and our lack of support allows us to be targets for confusion. It is this confusion to what we are, to how people treat us, that results in self-hatred, self-depreciation, self-loathing, and self-harm. And we cannot wait for others to be our voice because we are in need. As more attention is being placed towards identifying racism throughout the world, we need to be vocal, we need to stand to let people know: WE ARE THE DISENFRANCHISED TOO. WE ARE PEOPLE TOO.\n\nAnd that has been the movement I've been slowly pushing over social media. I want it to take off. I want us to unify and represent a community that has lacked a true community for so long. #wearepeopletoo\n\nAs people, we deserve to be treated like others. This means we deserve the freedom to be equals in society. We deserve to walk down the street or to make a new friendship without being asked for our race or ethnicity because #wearepeopletoo. We deserve to love and be loved not fetishized because #wearepeopletoo. We deserve to feel like we belong in our families, in our schools, in our government, in our country because #wearepeopletoo.\n\nRight now, the movement is just a hashtag. But even the largest movements begin somewhere. I will not pretend to know what I am doing. I will not pretend to be a leader or to stand as someone to look up to. I believe that this movement needs to be decentralized. No single leader, just a group of people, human beings, who see the need for a change. Right now I am using IG to push the hashtag but I want to begin moving to other platforms, putting out writing, establishing a website. I hoped we could establish [r/mixedrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/mixedrace) as a basis for a headquarters or begin to discuss a place to brainstorm. I stand with all people of the world and I want them to begin to see us as people too. #wearepeopletoo I know I need help, I need teammates and a community to support and be supported by. Even now as I tell people my idea for this movement they tell me I am being divisive, that I am causing more division in the world. But this was division that was forced on me, not one that I created. My goal is to end this division. I share that belief, that one they call utopic, that the world will be better when we see ourselves as one race: the human race.\n\nThank you for hearing me out,\n\nDae",

    "text": "PSA: CA STRIPCLUB \"LIBRARY,\" EXCLUSIVELY SCAMMING HISPANICS A lot of people don't want to talk about these businesses bc they think most people don't go there or are embarrassed to talk about it.\n\nThe reality is that most people don't specificaly go looking for these businesses but they get lured in by the big blue highway billboard.\n\nThis business has been targeting the community and I feel the need to warn people\n\n\n\nJust want to warn about a Prominent OC business that has scams fit for a movie. Forgive me for my bitterness,and your boy will now explain:\n\nYes, it is a strip club--you say, what's new?? Let me explain. Dated a girl from there and it blew up. Found out shit. Got permanent diseases. ...Found out exactly how stripper plot.....from hearing hours of dressing room convos...accidentally. Consider me schooled.\n\nLadies--even if your man is a holy man,please check his ATM, credit cards, debit, bank statements for a \"Bob Martin Inc\" I'm talking about Library Strip club chain. Ex said it's the culture of high level scams there. they can get away with it since it's next to the highway. Their billboard attracts many clueless guys. It's a tourist trap.\n\nI posted a review on Yelp and it got removed. Yelp thought it was some fake account bc it was a new account. What was I supposed to do?? Post on my regular account for all to see???\n\nGather around children ,and let me forewarn y all about what ACTUALLY goes on in that liar of HELL\n\n--they alledgedly drug guys there depending on circumstances. Bartenders do,not strippers. I was drugged there but though it was good posioning. ex confided that bartenders and waitresses will drug your drink secretly while they make it, u can't even see it Cuz they r slick, to ready you for their stripper friend to hustle you.\n\nWhatever drugs they use clears in a few hours so ur shit out of luck for evidence. Instead of waking up with 20k gone like in the hustlers movie, you only feel barely dizzy and lose 500-1500. After all, they dont want to get caught.\n\nPartially causing all covid cases in Santa ana, anaheim in the Hispanic Community......\n\nMy ex got covid not once,but twice there. (I lost my business during covid and she needed to work...I didn't qualify for PPP coronavirus relief government loans but library Club managed to get them, against federal policy saying strip clubs r barred!!!!)\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/projects/ppp-business-loans/businesses/bob-martin-inc\n\nLibrary club =bob martin inc.\n\nUnfortunately, Covid has really fucked with the hispanic community in Santa ana and anaheim and part of me thinks it's from Manuel going to the library Club and then eating weekend dinner with Abuela. We all know hispanic families have multiple generations under 1 roof. Just because Daniel the 24 year old isn't sick doesn't mean he can't pass viruses to abuelo!!! Yes, they were open all during covid even when indoor dining was banned. you can get a block of dances from a girl that has rubbed herself over 15 other men in the past few hours. No distancing, it happens in the blocked off room.\n\nEx infmored me girls pass around cough syrup and anti nausea meds in the dressing room to hide covid symptoms.\n\nDont fuck a girl from there. You gonna get sick. I have 2lifelong diseasesfrom my ex. She got it from the managers there. I now have monthly outbreaks and have to take pills that cause diarrhea. Condoms dont protect always.\n\nMind blown over listening to girls dressing room conversations. These ain't your ditzy college student/single mom. These girls actually get off of conning men. These girls were laughing like Mr. Burns from the Simpsons....\n\nSnooped on ex's phone back when I thought she was cheating and found fistfuls of audio recordings. Thought they were recording of her side boy and Sent them to myself. Turns out she was being threatened constantly by other girls in the dressing room for fights a d she wanted to record audio with her phone while she did her hair.\n\nInstead, during that time Her phone captured hours of dressing room conversations between strippers, from a girl specializing in romance-scamming undocumented but monied Hispanics, 4 at a time (and if he found out and got mad she threatened to report him). Her whole family would have dinners with him to fake it. To a stripper meeting a guy at a hotel and having her boyfriend steal your catalytic converter while you think your dick will get wet. Girls rigging cameras to videotape your escorting session and which camera was best...to send to your wife later on if you didn't agree to pay blackmail...having her shady cop boyfriend run your car plates through the police database illegally to figure out where you live and blackmail you....to where is my HIV pill I think I dropped it....that condom broke and the guy didn't even notice it (giggle giggle, from HIV girl to another girl in spanish) Etc etc. Two girls plotting to entertain 1 guy, so each could memorize half of his credit card info....barbacks secretly copying credit card info to use on games months later. Now I speak Spanish and portugese and English, so I'm sure some of these convos were never meant to be heard and understood. Crazy enough, these girls didn't even sound \"ghetto \" you would never think these girls were two faced snakes first meeting them, apparently.\n\nMy relationship blew up when I learned my girl wasn't acting weird and depressed because she was cheating. Got her positive HPV /HSV? results in the mail from her pap, confronted her, she claims she was forced into sexual shit by the managers. Apparently that's the majority of girls there so they won't even know who my ex actually is (hundreds of girls on roster!!)\n\nThere are 3 managers , Kyle Frutiger(somewhat midget, buff),\n\nJeremy Feindel (skinny tall, underbite, fucked up caves in smile, white trailer trash look)\n\nMike Dansse -- never met Mike but hear he is Irish..\n\nNow if you got the dough and the circumstances are too risky, they'll treat you like family. When times are ripe,they are ready to scam you. All the dumb people think it's all fun n games.\n\nJeremy the main manager, is a CONVICTED FELON (see link below for charges). Apparently he fucked over some JERSEY SHORE SNOOKI LOOAKLAIKE girl real bad just for fun, so she launched a class action lawsuit for some dumb non related reason and now my ex is owed some money.\n\nWhy does this matter? The owners will have to come up with an enormous sum of money---meaning the managers will be encouraging the girls to scam MORE GUYS LIKE YOU.\n\nhttps://www.localcrimenews.com/welcome/detail/24735075/jeremy-feindel-arrest.html\n\nThe midget manager, kyle, is a racist, homophobe:\n\nhttps://ibb.co/ZcvnVYY https://ibb.co/wSFgfs0https://ibb.co/sHGTp98 https://ibb.co/3rk9TTphttps://ibb.co/fXzN2Mg https://ibb.co/wMKCfk4https://ibb.co/3rsts6V https://ibb.co/9G0yHB0\n\nSettlement: Www.thelibraryclubsettlement.com\n\nStay safe my homies",

    "text": "All female management and HR forced me out of the company after reporting harassment This happened three years ago at a small company and it still has been weighing on me. It was one of those \"we're one big family\" tech companies who prided itself on having beer in the fridge and a \"great culture\". \n\nThe management structure above me was my lead (female), mid level manager (female), direct manager (female), and department head (male). The HR department was 3 people (all female). For what it's worth, I am also an ethnic minority and all the women in management were white women. \n\nMyself, a female colleague, and another male colleague were all up for a promotion. The only one that walked away with a promotion was my female colleague, despite myself and my male colleague being there far longer (I actually interviewed and made the call to hire the person who was promoted). The company had a formal list of criteria needed for a promotion, so I created a list with evidence for every bullet point and sent it to my manager. She refused to even glance at it and told me my accomplishments were not relevant. Weeks later I pleaded with her to go over this document and discuss my career goals. She flipped out on me, called me all kinds of names, and then stormed off. \n\nI went to the head of the department and explained what had happened. He was shocked at the behavior and had no idea what was going on in the department. He scheduled a meeting with the three of us and she tried to lay into me again, but instead her boss chewed her out for unprofessional behavior. He then saw my list of accomplishments and decided I was definitely in line for a promotion and I was promoted not long after, along with my male colleague. I thought it was over. Boy was I wrong.\n\nA few months later the department head left the company and was replaced by a female department head (so the entire management structure was female). My boss held a grudge and it was open season on me now. But this time she stepped over the line and harassed me over email with direct language about a disability I have. This is blatantly illegal so I went to HR. \n\nThey immediately defended her and tried to gaslight me. Everything I said they tried to counter, until I presented them with the harassment in writing. I stood firm and knew my rights and they backed down. What transpired after that was 6 months of retaliation (I spoke to a lawyer and he said there's not much you can do until they fire you). \n\nConstant belittling, talking bad about me to other coworkers, turning people against me. Every 1 on 1 meeting we had was recorded (something she never did to anyone else). Every time I pushed this up the all female chain of command it fell on deaf ears. Eventually I left the company, just like they wanted. My position was filled by my boss's female friend. I am told by someone that still works there she had been badmouthing me behind my back for over 2 years.\n\nKeep in mind this is a company where other female employees openly said they discriminated against men. They host and sponsor feminist events. They openly say their pride themselves on hiring women. \n\nWhen I reported my manager for harassment, it was me against a clique that openly made it clear where they stand, and that stance was firmly against men. This just showed me that harassment against men is real, and when the deck is stacked against you there is little that can be done.",

    "text": "Some common gender myths and their rebuttals It seems like the same discussions come up around Reddit a lot, so I figured I'd gather up some common topics, and their rebuttals.\n\nMany of these arguments can be expanded with more points and sources but I'm trying to keep this as compact and to the point as possible.\n\n####Myth 1: \"Sexism against men is never institutional or systematic\"\n\nMany forms of sexism and discrimination against men are *explicitly* institutionalized or systemic in society.\n\nExamples include police violence, court biases, incarceration, child custody discrimination, military service, educational biases, health research and spending, insurance, housing discrimination, reproductive rights, bodily autonomy rights, and many others.\n\nThe widespread ignorance and denialism around these issues can itself be interpreted as a form of systemic discrimination against men as well.\n\nNote that some of these are institutional because they boil down to statutory legal rights which exist in the realm of government policy and administration.  And the government is obviously an institution.\n\n#### Myth 2: \"Most politicians and CEOs are men, and this has led to a society that privileges men and disenfranchises women\"\n\nThe fact that many positions of formal power are occupied by men does not translate into measurable privileges for the average man.\n\nThe assumption this is based on is the idea that men have an in-group bias and prefer other men over women.\n\nWhich is an idea that has been debunked over and over again in the academic literature.  The gender bias among men is almost zero, and sometimes manifests as an out-group bias sightly in favor of women, not other men.\n\nIn-group bisses do exist among women though.  In fact some research has found evidence for very strong gender biases among women.  Including when it comes to educators, bosses, and hiring managers.  Women in formal positions of power do actually seem to prefer other women over men, in much the same way that men are accused of behaving. So maybe this is just projection: people who themselves have gender biases assume that everyone else does as well.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15491274\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103101915112\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_9\n\n####Myth 3: \"Women were uniquely oppressed in history compared to men\"\n\nMuch like today, sexism in history was often two sides of the same coin.  If it was unfair that women had to stay home and take care of their children then it was also unfair that men had to work long hours outside the comfort of their homes.  Many people try to equate sexism to the history of racism, as if men were unilaterally oppressing women for their own benefit. And that's simply not an accurate view of history (nor is it a very healthy belief to have).  \n\nGender norms were often unfair to women. But for most of history, women could own property, get divorced (where they usually took most of their husband's money), run businesses, and even be heads of state.  Many large empires were ran by women, for example.\n\nThe reality of the situation though is that pregnancy (and breastfeeding) often dictated the need for women to have men supporting them. Birth control and baby formula didn't exist. So your options were basically abstinence, or marriage. Which was the same choice that men also had.\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books/about/The_Privileged_Sex.html?id=4szznAEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description\n\nhttps://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download_file?file_format=application/pdf&safe_filename=Item.pdf&type_of_work=Journal%20article\n\nhttps://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199582174.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199582174-e-036\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/legalsubjection00baxgoog/\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/beard/woman-force/index.htm\n\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1855/f217b082603d0ab37ea80c4741fceb8a4a23.pdf\n\n**\"What about voting rights?\"**\n\nVoting rights were historically tied to military service and the draft. It was never something that men got \"for free\" just for being men.\n\nIn England, most men couldn't vote until 1918, and that was only because they instituted a draft for all men during WWI.\n\nWomen aged 30 and older were also given the right to vote in 1918, and this came without the same obligation to serve in the military that men had.  Women over 21 were given voting rights just 10 years later in 1928, which was the same age that men could vote.  And that temporary age difference had a practical purposes: so many men died in WW1 that there was a need to even out the gender ratio.\n\nSo men have been allowed to vote for a whopping 10 years longer than women, *at most*.  And that was only because of the mass, involuntary slaughter that they experienced around the world during WW1.\n\nOther obligations that men had were paying taxes, attending caucuses, and signing up for bucket bridges to fight fires.\n\nIt took a few decades in some parts of the world for people to decide that it was fair for women to be able to vote without giving anything back to the state, but I think it's important to understand the context here. It wasn't misogyny or oppression but political theory.  Specifically the question of whether or not it was fair to give women voting rights without equivalent responsibilities that were required from men (something known as a [moral hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard), and that can be contextualized as *\"female privilege also sometimes harming women\"*).\n\nhttps://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/womenvote/parliamentary-collections/collections-the-vote-and-after/representation-of-the-people-act-1918/\n\nhttp://www.familyofmen.com/when-did-men-and-women-have-the-right-to-vote-in-canada/\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/iu2ebj/women_could_and_did_own_property_and_have_rights/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/l1byes/suffrage_was_primarily_a_class_issue_not_a_gender/\n\n####Myth 4: \"Domestic violence and sexual assault are primarily women's issues\"\n\nDomestic violence and sexual assault affects everyone, and at nearly identical rates between men and women.\n\nIn the US, roughly 37.3% of women have been victims of domestic violence, stalking, sexual harassment, and sexual abuse.  Including 1.4 million women who experience sexual assault annually.\n\nFor men that same figure is 30.9%. Including 1.7 million men who experience sexually assault annually (defined as \"made to penetrate\").  The vast majority of these men are also victimized by women, not by \"other men\" (which is another myth).\n\nThis pattern is similar across the world, including in poor and underdeveloped nations (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/koinom/some_sources_on_the_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys/) for a collection of studies), and is consistent with a wide range of research demonstrating \"gender parity\" between men and women for this topic.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf\n\nhttp://webshare.law.ucla.edu/Faculty/bibs/stemple/Stemple-SexualVictimizationPerpetratedFinal.pdf\n\nhttps://1in6.org\n\nIt's also not true that there's a significant difference in severity between male and female victims.  Around 66% of intimate partner homicides do have women as victims (which is hardly a staggering majority), but when you include intimate partner related suicide deaths (including assisted suicides), a greater number of men are killed because of domestic violence than women.  These statistic also ignore the fact that lesbian relationships are more violent than heterosexual and gay male relationships.  Which inflates these numbers and doesn't necessarily back up the idea that women are being uniquely victimized by men.\n\nWe should obviously work to fight against abuse in any form, but our current, gendered approach to this doesn't seem to be helping very much.  It is also commonly used as an excuse for misandry.  Many people who discuss abuse against women do not actually care about female victims.  All they care about is advancing a culture of hatred and sexism against men.\n\nhttps://web.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm\n\nhttps://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.5042/jacpr.2010.0141/full/html\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01506/full\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/f4rvop/some_sources_on_the_severity_of_domestic_violence/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/koinom/some_sources_on_the_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/f5tes5/gender_parity_for_sexual_assault_academic_studies/\n\n**\"But women are afraid to walk down dark alleyways at night!\"**\n\nAs they should.  And as do men.  Most violent crime targets men. And fear is subjective. This is hardly evidence of some kind of unique oppression against women (at least one that doesn't also affect men), and it ignores the fact that men are usually afraid of finding themselves in those same situations as well.\n\nMen are stronger and more capable of defending themselves so I wouldn't blame someone for having gendered views or assumptions here.  But let's try not to minimize male victimization or blame it on things like \"male oppression\".\n\n####Myth 5: \"False allegations are extremely rare\"\n\nMultiple studies have found alarmingly high rates of false allegations in society.\n\nAs many as 1 in 7 men have been falsely accused at some point in their life, and they often have to live with those allegations even after proving their innocence.\n\nIn addition, around 1 in 20 women have also been falsely accused at some point during their life.\n\nFalse allegations are particularly common when it comes to child custody and divorce, where well over half of all allegations have been estimated to be false.  There is also a common racial element that targets minority men.  Especially in history during the era of lynchings in the US.\n\nhttp://www.saveservices.org/dv/falsely-accused/survey/\n\n http://www.prosecutorintegrity.org/pr/survey-over-20-million-have-been-falsely-accused-of-abuse/\n\nhttps://quillette.com/2019/04/16/divorce-and-the-silver-bullet/\n\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/14977/14977-h/14977-h.htm\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/e6w4yc/i_call_bullshit_on_the_false_rape_accusation/\n\n####Myth 6: \"Men commit suicide more often than women, but women still *attempt* suicide more often than men\"\n\nThis idea has its origins with faulty hospital reporting which lumps suicide attempts in with self-harm (which is something that's more common among women).  Women are also more likely to report their suicide attempts than men. And even if this statistic were accurate, it ignores the obvious fact that a suicide survivor can attempt again, thus artificially inflating this statistic.\n\nThe fact is, most suicid deaths are men, and most evidence points to there being more unique attempts by men. Any evidence that men are \"better\" at it than women has been interpreted as evidence for greater motivation of success, due to the very same factors that lead them to attempt suicide to begin with. Not as evidence that women are somehow attempting suicide at rates similar to men in the background.\n\nhttps://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1398-8\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/cvpyve/comment/ey5xeda\n\n####Myth 7: \"Men make more money because of their gender, and this is evidence of male privilege\"\n\nExisting gender norms encourage men to earn money in order to meet the financial demands that are placed on them by women.\n\nThis causes them to work harder and sacrifice more for their careers than women. Which they do in part because their income is tied to how successful they are with women, and whether or not they qualify as \"marriage material\".\n\nThe wage gap is therefore an example of a gender norm that harms men just as much as it does women.\n\n92% of workplace deaths are men. Men work on average an extra 4 to 10 hours a week (depending on your source) than women. They start working at a younger age (often skirting child labor laws). They retire later (which is also during their peak earning years). And they die sooner than women. Men have worse health outcomes than women and that's largely because of the pressures that society puts on them to be successful and earn money to spend on women.\n\nThis is the other side of the wage gap that is equally as important, and that is equally as harmfully to men as it is to women. And it's really just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIn many ways the wage gap is just a reflection of the financial exploitation of men in society.  Which is facilitated by things like hypergamy and unfair marriage and divorce practices.\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/kzvfcg/about_the_wage_gap/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/dxaimc/the_wage_gap_is_created_by_women_and_reflects/\n\n####Myth 8: \"Men don't go to the doctor because of toxic masculinity\"\n\nThe main reason that men sometimes don't seek help is a lack of time to see a doctor.\n\nMen work longer hours than women at jobs that are less flexible, and more stressful, than jobs that women usually work at. [Men overall engage in an extra hour of paid and unpaid labor per day compared to women](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/ft_18-05-01_fathersday_time/), and an extra 45 minutes commuting to jobs that are further away. Meaning men on average have quite a bit less free time to go see a doctor than women do.\n\nThis is also something that changes during retirement: retired men are just as likely to go to the doctor as retired women.\n\nhttps://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e003320\n\nA general lack of help and support, especially financial support, for men who need medical help also contributes to this.  There is a myth that men are better taken care of than women which has resulted in gendered policies that help women, but exclude men.  Even though it's men who often need that help more.\n\n####Myth 9: \"Men don't speak up about sexism as much as women, so it's obviously not as big of an issue\"\n\nThis is because people are less likely to care or listen to them. In part because many men who do speak up are silenced and accused of being misogynistic. A situation known as testimonial injustice or [epistemic oppression](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-epistemic-oppression/).\n\nMen are told to keep quiet and many end up internalizing the idea that only women can be discriminated against, since this is what society tells us to believe.  Instead, men often adopt different terminology when they discuss gender issues.  Like referring to differences in treatment between men and women as \"double standards\" instead of sexism or discrimination.\n\n####Myth 10: \"Most men's issues are caused by men themselves\"\n\nMost men's issues are caused by gender norms and those gender norms are enforced by women just as much as they are by men.\n\nMen's issues are often just one side of the coin, and usually reflect disadvantages that women face as well.\n\nOne of the biggest gender norms in society is hypergamy, or the tendency for women to try to marry up, and for men to marry down.  And this gender norm is mostly enforced by women, not by men.\n\nTwo other gender norm that are enforced by women is the providership gender norm, and the childcare gender norm. Which also causes women to perform more unpaid work and earn less money than men in the labor market.\n\nA fourth gender norm that is enforced by women more than men is the \"boys don't cry bias\". Which is mainly instilled in young boys by their mothers and by female school teachers.  In fact, fathers and male school teachers actually fight against this gender norm.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053535711000321\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/messages-of-shame-are-organized-around-gender/275322/\n\nhttps://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/09/24/chapter-1-public-views-on-marria\n\nhttps://scholar.harvard.edu/files/akillewald/files/money_work_and_marital_stability.pdf\n\nhttps://www.fatherhood.org/fatherhood/maternal-gatekeeping-why-it-matters-for-children\n\nhttps://news.uoguelph.ca/2019/11/mothers-push-gender-stereotypes-more-than-fathers-study-reveals/\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/gjtj10/most_people_regardless_of_gender_prefer_to_stay/\n\n####Myth 11: \"Toxic masculinity is harming men and their mental health\"\n\nThe concept of toxic masculinity has never been empirically tested, and some research questions the validity of it in the context of psychology and mental health.\n\nEven if you do think it is valid though, it is still commonly used in a way that is sexist and hateful torwards men.\n\nIn recent years it has become associated with female supremacy, feminist hostility towards men, and misandry in general.  And as a result, the vast majority of men find the term to be sexist and offensive.\n\nMen who identify with traditional masculine values have greater self-esteem, better mental health, better relationships with women, and are usually better educated than men who are opposed to masculinity or who accept feminist views about the patriarchy and toxic masculinity.\n\nThe key to better mental health for men might therefore be an embracement of masculinity, not a shunning of it.  Instead of trying to redefine masculinity, we should work to understand it better, and offer men better services based on an honest acknowledgement that men's and women's mental health might require different approaches.\n\nMen are not \"defective women\", and treating men's mental health in that context does not seem to be working very well.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/apa-guidelines-men-boys.html\n\nhttps://zenodo.org/record/3871217#.X-p1ji2l2J_\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_5\n\n####Myth 12: \"Most men's activists just hate women or are opposed to feminism.  They don't really care about men.\"\n\nThis rhetoric is normally used to silence the voices of men (and women) who support men's rights and prevent them from expressing themselves.  Which makes it another example of testimonial injustice or epistemic oppression.\n\nThe fact is that many people do care about men's issues, and that's why they become MRAs.  Feminism does get discussed in the men's movement, but there are a couple reasons for that:\n\n1. Many feminists, \"radical\" or otherwise, have advocated against men and have even pushed for public policy in ways that are harmful to men or discriminates against men. Feminists themselves tend to not fight against this, meaning it's often up to MRAs to address it.\n\n2. Many MRAs are themselves current or ex-feminists who were ostracized for daring to take the feminist rhetoric about *\"also caring about men\"* a little too seriously.\n\nWarren Farrell is a great example of this. He used to be on the board of directors for NOW, the world's largest feminist organization.\n\nAnd then he said that we need to work on child custody equality and reproductive rights for men. Topics that he assumed should fall under the umbrella of feminism since they are issues pertaining to gender equality.  Instead of agreeing with him though, he ended up being excommunicated from the feminist movement. And now he's often regarded as the \"father of the modern men's movement\" for carrying on his advocacy outside of feminism.\n\nThe problem that many MRAs have with feminism is that it usually stops half way when advocating for gender equality.\n\nSo sometimes what MRAs are doing is just taking it the rest of the way towards actual gender equality. Our frustration with feminists comes from the fact that they refuse to see this as valid (or do it themselves to begin with).\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ihmb2p/by_denying_that_the_feminist_establishment_is/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/9v6tqj/a_list_about_feminism_misandry_for_anyone_who/\n\n####Myth 13: \"Men don't receive custody of their children because they're bad fathers and don't bother requesting custody\"\n\nAcademic research simply does not back this up.  [The only study that ever found something like this was discovered to be purposefully fraudulent](http://www.breakingthescience.org/SJC_GBC_analysis_intro.php), although that hasn't stopped people from trying to repeat this. The fact is that men are widely discriminated against on numerous different fronts when it comes to child custody and other areas involving family court law.  \n\nNote also how hateful this rhetoric is.  This is the kind of stuff that you find repeated by feminists, and it simply doesn't treat this topic in a fair and honest manner.  Fathers love their children and many fight tooth and nail just to get a few hours a week to spend with them. The system is broken and it represents a grave social injustice that is deeply unfair to fathers and their children.\n\nhttps://www.sharedparenting.org/2019-shared-parenting-report\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ilzceq/cmv_equal_child_custody_for_mothers_and_fathers/\n\n####Myth 14: \"Most child abusers are men\"\n\nA majority of child abuse is actually committed by women, and especially by mothers.  This is even more true when you include emotional abuse and neglect instead of just physical abuse.\n\nBy some metrics, the biological father is the safest person for a child to be with. This is because when men do abuse children, it often happens while under the custody of the mother.  Who is sometimes complicit in the abuse or even encourages it.\n\nClose to half of child abductors and traffickers are also women, not men.  And many of their victims are boys.  Boys face sexual abuse and are also used for forced labor and organ harvesting. They are less likely to survive or escape, are less likely to be reported on or identified, and they suffer from higher rates of abuse than girls who are trafficked.\n\nAnd yet very little attention is given to this.  Missing boys, and especially missing minority boys, are often ignored by society and the media. To the point that people often assume that most of the victims are girls.  Something which is known as the [missing white woman syndrome](https://archive.is/mRIJL) (although in Canada there is a lot of attention given to missing indigenous women, even though 71% of missing indigenous people are men and boys).\n\nNote that I'm not saying these things to attack women, imply that they shouldn't receive custody, or to downplay the plight of girls.  Which is a lot more than you can say about people who try to paint men as the villains in this picture.  We should however be fair about what the facts are, and give male victimization, including victimization by women, the attention that it deserves.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16165212\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/childmaltreatment-facts-at-a-glance.pdf\n\nhttp://www.breakingthescience.org/SimplifiedDataFromDHHS.php\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0145213416302599\n\nhttps://www.savethechildren.org/us/charity-stories/child-trafficking-myths-vs-facts\n\n*Fair is fair and equal is equal.  Gender equality will never be fixed if we refuse to look at both sides of the coin.  We need to be honest about what the problems are, and stop ignoring them when they involve men, fathers, and boys.*",

    "text": "The Activision/Blizzard lawsuit alleging widespread harassment of women ignored Men who were also harassed. from [thegamer](https://www.thegamer.com/blizzard-devs-male-harassment-report/)\n\n>A report from Kotaku alleges that male employees were also subjected to sexual harassment within the walls of Activision Blizzard. One employee on Twitter (whose name was withheld for his protection) shared that he experienced unwanted shoulder-rubbing, sex proposals, and conversations about sex acts in front of colleagues who remained silent. He didn't take any issues to HR as he feared this would lead to gossip around the office. He also alleges that other employees he confided in brushed off the incidents.  \n>  \n>Another story comes from Cher Scarlett, a former engineer at Blizzard. She not only corroborates the frat-boy culture that the lawsuit claims is still happening, but mentions that senior managers would regularly engage in games where they would grope male colleagues' genitals. One such was called \"gay chicken\" and tasked managers with being \"the first man to grab the others' junk.\" Scarlett says she knows of at least three men who reported Activision Blizzard to the DFEH, which resulted in the current lawsuit.\n\nHere's the thing, the language of [the lawsuit](https://regmedia.co.uk/2021/07/22/activision_blizzard_complaint.pdf) explicitly places the blame of harassment on male employees and frames the problem as coming from maleness. Quoting for example:\n\n>Defendants workforce is only about 20 percent women. Its top leadership is also exclusively male and white.  \n>  \n>Male employees proudly come into work hung over, play video games for long periods of time during work while delegating their responsibilities to female employees, engage in banter about their sexual encounters, talk openly about female bodies, and joke about rape.\n\nEvery time Men are mentioned in this document it's stories of what they did wrong or characterized as if all males were the owners and privileged few of Activision/Blizzard, extrapolated from a handful of stories yet mentioned in duplicate throughout the document. I could not find any mention of the male victims or any effort to find male criticism of the workplace culture (even though you can find it online). The way in which the lawsuit is phrased makes it sound as every male employee is guilty of these acts and that clearly is not the case as they signed the open letter and participated in the walkout.\n\nAs it says above, the DFEH was able to file this lawsuit on part because of male employees reporting their harassment to the DFEH after having been rebuked by HR. Yet the DFEH assigns them no importance, and even demonizes them in the report.\n\n>Plaintiff DFEH, an agency of the State of California, brings this enforcement action against Defendants in its prosecutorial role, seeking relief in the public interest for the state **and for Defendants' female employees(\"the Group\").**\n\nThis is a betrayal. This is no different than what Blizzard's HR department did to it's employees. These Men reported to the DFEH and it thanked them by seeking justice exclusively for female employees. Unless these clients actually are supported but aren't included in the filing by their appropriate sex, then this lawsuit will be stealing from male victims. The DFEH is charged with protecting 'all persons from unlawful discrimination' and this ain't it.",

India is obviously a vast country with many races. These areas do not at all represented the major cities and other developed educated areas. This being said the media will tend to publish as though it is widespread in India aswell exaggerating the actual incidents prior to any convictions causing stereotyping of Indian men.\n\nThey have been experiencing that white women (not Asians) in Australia tend to discriminate against them in their work places with one describing a situation where even their strata manager had not attended to a complaint they made within the building that they rent appropriately.\n\nTo the Indian men out there, is this something you have personally experienced?",

    "text": "A Non-Apocalyptic Future of the Sexual Marketplace/State of Gender Relations **NOTE: I was asked by the mods to post this here. I admit its pretty rampant speculation and I can't rule out confounding factors (and IRL there are always confounding factors). But I was asked, and I'm happy to contribute. So please discuss away.**\n\nI'm very averse to the kind of apocalypticism that some people are predicting here. Although maybe I have an optimistic bias. Alternatively, predictions about the future tend to have a bad record.\n\nI think the marriage and birth rates will continue to fall, since as a simple matter of cost-benefit analysis there's little incentive for western men to marry or even procreate. This is an example of what contract theorists and economists call the \"hold-up problem\" - people won't make relationship-specific investments if the gain on all these investments can be expropriated by their contractual partner.\n\nThe risk of female company in situations where she can get away with a false rape accusation will cause increasing separation between the sexes. We will see male groups organizing outside of the \"feminine panopticon\", using crypto, and existing informally. This sex segregation and mutual distrust will NOT be good for women in the workplace.\n\nI think we'll see a growth in the number of men identifying as queer (heteroflexible, bisexual or gay). That will cause a lot of issues in the \"LGBTQ\"/PC/SJW camp, possibly causing a split between queer men and all the \"other\" sexual/gender minorities. We're already seeing splits along the \"queer vs. trans\" issue and we're also seeing examples of queer men being 'demoted' down the Progressive Stack so this seems to be already in progress.\n\nEconomically, I think there will be some sort of breakdown or backlash over the issue of college education. We're already in a place of substantial credential inflation and the whole \"revolt against the elites\" that came along with the recent populist surge (Brexit, Trump etc) has made it clear that college education is becoming not just the fulcrum of \"social class\" but also that its becoming worth less and less and is full of demented indoctrination rather than valuable knowledge. This isn't necessarily a gender issue, but I can see a huge and overdue market correction coming where white collar/professions (particularly middle managers etc) experience a big drop in returns, and the skilled trades making more money. We've already seen examples of this on a smaller scale - I think its going to get bigger.\n\nAnd this, ultimately, is where the issue becomes gendered - less men are going to college so we can expect more women in the professions/clerical/administrative and more men in the skilled trades, men making more and women making less, women saddled with more student debt, etc. (of course this partially depends on education policy but I think eventually we'll see some funding redirected from academic to vocational soon enough).\n\nWill this all end in an apocalypse? Maybe not. But I can see a growing rift between the sexes, a female dominated clerical-professional class experiencing extreme disillusionment, the development of thicker but less official male spaces under the radar, men retreating to the skilled trades and being unexpectedly successful, and a queer-inclusive \"man's man\" lifestyle becoming more of a thing.\n\nWill the result be a huge attack from a lot of disillusioned women? Maybe. But I get skeptical about long chains of extrapolation. In theory I can imagine some sort of resurgence in the kind of radical feminism that hated queer men, the women's movement demanding bachelor taxes, possibly some attempt to make sperm donors pay child support for any fetus conceived with that sperm, although more likely we'll see extra attempts to 'preserve' the value of college degrees for women (like more affirmative action etc).",

I want to tell you a story about blatant and unchallenged bigotry and discrimination at a place of public accommodations.\n\nA human entered a public business and was promptly told by the manger that they needed to leave as they did want them around the kids in the building. In fact, one of the assistants ushered them to safety in fear that this person was there to harm them.\n\nThe human talked with the manager saying that it was discriminatory and  improper for them to do so, but the manager insisted that they leave.\n\nThe human left and then went to the civil rights commission and filed a case. Before the commission came to a conclusion, they offered a conciliation that was between them and the business. The human didn't agree with this as they were not included in the conciliation.\n\nThe commission eventually came back and said yes, there was a probable cause of sex discrimination (not that hard to conclude really as they openly admitted to it.)

That they (the commission) came to an agreement between themselves and the business which excluded the human and closed the case.\n\nEven though the rampant bigotry against this human has been going on for the past 17 years, the mainstream media has remained mostly silent.
