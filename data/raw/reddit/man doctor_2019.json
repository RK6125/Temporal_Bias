    "text": "Job searching with mental health issues, name changes, and generally offputting work history? Hi guys. I need help regarding questions about my work history, because it's been very unstable due to some life changes and mental health issues, and I'm not sure how to go about anything anymore. I've been out of work for a few months now and it's time I start looking about getting back into the working life. My work history is a bit questionable, so I'll just start from the beginning of my professional career and go from there. \n\nI have a 2 year associates degree in electrical engineering (with a specialty in biomedical technology) and was hired at a hospital as a biomedical technician, basically someone that repairs and maintains medical equipment. I started as an entry level technician directly out of schooling, and was promoted to an intermediate level technician a couple years later. I worked for this employer for 3 years.\n\nI was fired from that job because I was caught sleeping on the job on more than one occasion. I was going through a major chronic depressive episode (I'm diagnosed major depressive disorder and bipolar 2) and was no longer able to preform the functions of the work. I was unemployed for one year following that, and found work at a small company that did field service work for the same thing (maintaining medical equipment for small doctor's offices and surgery centers around the state [Pennsylvania]). It was a small company owned by a man and his wife, and the only employees were me, one other gentleman, and the owners two daughters.\n\nI was fired from that job a year later, allegedly because I drove the company car to a Dr's appointment on my way home from work (and it was agreed that the car would never be used for personal reasons, so it is entirely my fault and I accept that).\n\nI was out of work for another year and figured I would give up on the professional side of my life for then and just find normal work. After all, being fired twice from the same position at two different companies puts a bad taste in a lot of engineer's mouths, so...\n\nI was hired a year after that job at a Sheetz here in Pennsylvania (a gas station / convenience store / restaurant, some are more familiar with Wawa which is kind of the same thing). I was with Sheetz for three years. I started as a janitor, then worked as a front house cashier/kitchen position, then promoted to Shift Manager and ran the night shift. I loved that job... almost more than my engineering positions. \n\nAnyway... During my time at Sheetz, I decided to medically transition (I'm MtF transgender, have been all my life, just never had a chance to finally transition). I went full time, changed my name and gender markers on all of my documentation, have been on hormones for nearly three years now and have been living full time as a passable woman for three years. Sheetz was incredible during my transition and I had zero issues with them as a company, nor from my coworkers and bosses.\n\nHere's where most of my problems come in. My wife and I split up and are divorcing after an 11 year marriage, and I have four children. This past June, my children moved out to live with their mother full time in Nebraska (again I'm in Pennsylvania), and this caused me to become incredibly, majorly depressed and suicidal. I began cutting and have massive scars on my left arm, and spent most of this past summer in various mental inpatient units due to being severely suicidal. \n\nI took FMLA leave and was on short term disability for a few months while all this was happening. When I got released from the hospital and finally returned to work at Sheetz, I only lasted a few days before I realized if I kept working, I was going to either wind up back in the hospital, or be dead. My mental health has been very.... shaky, and it was incredibly difficult for me to return to work, run a team, deal with customers, and just generally be around the knives that I used to try to kill myself months before. So I wound up quitting that job, after three years.\n\nI'm at the point now where I think I'm ok, I'm a bit more stable than I was, but I still have many mental health issues that are making re-entering society a difficult matter. But sitting around stewing about it all isn't going to make things better, and I need to just get back out there and force myself to get better, because sitting around doing nothing all day isn't helping.\n\nI want to get back into a semi-professional field, and there are plenty of electro-mechanical  jobs around here, like maintaining and repairing things like food manufacturing equipment and what not. My problems are these:\n\nHow do I explain to potential employers about why I was fired from my only two professional jobs? And the year long depressive gap between them both?\n\nHow do I explain that I worked those jobs as a man? I really don't want to just flat out tell the employers that I'm trans and give them my old information, but I feel it's almost impossible not to. I'll just have to accept this one and bite the pain back I think.\n\nHow do I explain that I left my last job due to mental health reasons? That I could not emotionally and mentally handle the work or the environment? How is that in ANY way not going to send up a million red flags for the employer?\n\nI also have no professional references, only a couple managerial ones from my time at Sheetz. When a prospective job contacts my previous employers, am I just going to have to grit my teeth and hope they're not told horrible information? I'm not a bad employee, I just had some troubling times. \n\nI feel like anywhere I apply is just going to look at me like a total basket case and not even want to bother giving me a chance. \n\nSorry this post is so long, I really don't know what to do, or where to go.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice you give me. \n-L",

    "text": "Looking for jobs that I can do despite chronic health issues I'm a married man in my mid twenties. I have chronic physical, and to a lesser extent mental, health problems that have been a battle for years now. It can be extremely difficult, although not impossible, for me to leave the house by specific times due to these health issues. Some days it's hard to leave at all. I also often sleep poorly and have low energy. This has prevented me from being able to pursue a more standard career with a regularly scheduled job. \n\nMy mom owns a small home watch business for vacation rentals and seasonal homes. We do weekly inspections on homes to make sure everything is as it should be. We live in an area that has a lot of these. I have worked with this business since I was out of high-school and over years have slowly taken on more responsibility. It works for me because it's very flexible so if I'm having a bad day I can do less or no work if I need to and do extra another day. At this point my wife and I do the majority of the work in this business and soon my mom wants us to take ownership of it completely. I am willing to run the business, I have already been a successful small business owner some years ago, but that business was not something I could maintain after a few years passed with health issues. \n\nNeither of us particularly likes the home watch business though. It's simply been a way to pay the bills and I don't look forward to handling more responsibility in a job that I already dislike some. If I can't find an alternative I'll do it, but I wanted to find out if anyone had suggestions for some kind of job that I might have overlooked that fits my needs.\n\nI have taken some college courses and had started towards a degree in computer networking, but I never finished due to health problems and other reasons. I would be willing to pursue work that required some education, but nothing that would need years invested.\n\nWhat I need is a job with a flexible schedule, not labor intensive, preferably working on my own with a small number of people, and earns a minimum of $25,000-$30,000 a year.\n\nBonus points if it's a job that involves repairing things, or some kind of creativity, project focused\n\nI realize I'm pretty limited to what I can do, but after years of doctor visits it looks like I'm going to be dealing with these health issues for a long time still. They are improving, but it's slow and often 2 steps forward and 1 back. I'm just looking for more options to consider.",

    "text": "Feeling guilty the longer I stay? I took a new job as an office admin/ marketing coordinator with a small business 2 months ago. I was really excited about the role and  it as a good learning opportunity for someone still entry level. Now I’m frustrated with the disorganization of the company, my boss, and I worried about my job stability.\n\nI was hired to replace a woman who has been in the role for 11 years. She is currently 70 years old. She was already retired when she took this job. The reason she is retiring again is health issues. She has been out sick a lot and has a lot of doctors appointments. Because of this the company’s books are in a mess and we are behind in payment on several accounts. She is supposed to be stepping down to part time but so far hasn’t done it . She has taught me some stuff but there is a still a lot I don’t know. When I ask her about something I expect her to show me how to do it or give me written instructions, instead she just does it herself. The workers at the company still send her invoices and reports and etc which she eventually passes along to me. Even when a phone call comes in she will pass it along to me even if I don’t know the answer, so I end up having to take a message, and ask the her about it.\n\nMy boss, the company’s owner, a 60 year old man. He is overly involved and micromanages every aspect of the company. He is a poor manager and will assign multiple people to one job with no clear direction or instruction. Or he will schedule for things to be done but forget to tell the office and then gets angry when we don’t have things ready for him. He doesn’t hold people accountable. He we several people my boss openly talks down about saying they have not future at his company, he has no confidence in them, etc, but yet he doesn’t nothing about them. He does not discipline and he does not fire people even when he rightly should. As a result we do have a lot of people that just come to work perform subpar and just take whatever paycheck they can get. Then my boss has a weekly meeting where he complains about how no one is doing anything right and how labor is his biggest cost.\n\nI feel like he expects me to solve all their i issues overnight. Becuase of the old lady’s health issues and that fact she’s let some invoices slip through or not pay them, we often get calls from company’s trying to collect payment. My boss will demand an answer from me and ask what invoices are past due and it is all stuff from before I even started. \n\nMy boss is always stressed about finances and is trying to cut as many costs as possible. He closed out office last Thursday and Friday for thanksgiving but didn’t pay us for Friday to save money. He’s laid off our front secretary to save money. \n\nI took this job to first get closer to home and two for a learning experiences becuase I do like some of my work. Becuase of this I was willing to take a slight pay cut. My boss promised to review my performance after a month and consider a raise, from his words he made it sound like I would get my old salary back. When I did get a review he gave me $.50 cents. I was unhappy with this raise and made to feel guilty for expecting more becuase the woman I’m replacing was being paid less. Also I do not have any benefits at this job and get no paid time off until I’ve been here a year. \n\nI’ve started applying to jobs again because  I don’t feel secure here. I just feel guilty for leaving so soon becuase they’ve already introduced me all over as so and sos replacement. The woman I’m replacing also seems to be looking forward to part time work and if I leave it will throw a wrench in that but I know I have to do what’s best for me. I’d rather get out sooner than later.",

    "text": "Need some opinions on micromanagement regarding hours worked Hey everyone, I have a question for you guys about micromanagement.\n\nI first started as a contractor at my current company 4 months ago with the intention to convert to full time after 6 months as that's how long it would take for my company to be able to get me out from my vendor without having to pay them fees. However, I realized that being a contractor was much more profitable due to certain tax regulations and decided to stay on as a contractor long term which works out for everyone as the company doesn't need to pay benefits or vacation just salary while I get to pay less taxes. My vending company and my previous manager basically just said if you worked the day you bill 8 hours as a full day worked. Sometimes we'd do a bit more than 8 other times a bit less but we typically received glowing feedback and no one really penny pinched the hours. \n\nHowever, recently a new manager came in and it could be due to inexperience as this is his first time in an official management role but he said he's having talks with everyone about being more \"honest\" with hours billed. I can only infer this as he doesn't believe people are working a full 8 hours to the dot and wants to clamp down on what he perceives as dishonesty. I brought up my concerns to him about how in this industry isn't always so black and white with regards to man hours and results and it's often hard to quantify what's billable and what is not. I tried to explain that from my perspective it'd a lot easier for everyone that we just bill 8 work hours for a day under normal circumstances and there's no need to pay overtime for little things unless it's extreme circumstance like the day we spent 12 hours from 4pm to 4am on sunday to support a production launch.\n\nHis response was that if you're working at \"50%\" capacity then that time would count as billable and he wants everyone to keep track on a daily basis accurate to nearest half hour or something (didn't specify how accurate but wants more \"accuracy\"). He admits this straight micromanagement but it's something he wants to do. I asked him what about that one day where I spent 4 hours on call after work monitoring a release but only really spent 30min max on actual work while the rest of it was watching basketball or playing PC games which he said that would count even though it goes against what he just said.\n\nIn the end I asked him what exactly is so bad about what is being done currently which is to just treat everyone like a full time employee and pay 40 hours per week as the default pay. He sounded fairly upset when his response was: \"Well you're a contractor, you should be a salaried employee then if you want that\".\n\nAll in all I'm not happy about this at all. I never considered about hours worked and would happily assist off hours or respond to inquiries at night. Since he mentioned the 50% thing should I just type with 1 hand because that's 50%? Should I be calculating every minute I'm assisting with inquires to bill those hours? Where do I draw the proverbial line? Furthermore, what happens if I go to dentist or a doctor's appointment one day. Does he expect people to keep track of the exact time they left and when they come back? What motivation do I have to work on something faster if I can stretch out half a days work into a full days work? I also have a coworker who has a favourite coffee place about 20 min away and he often takes up to an hour to go there back. Wonder if that'll get clamped down too.\n\nAnyway, I just want to get some other people's opinion. Maybe I'm being unreasonable but I don't see how this can be a good thing for anyone and it just creates stress needlessly for all parties.",

    "text": "Did I make the wrong move? Did I let my temper get the best of me? Okay so here’s my story. I posted it earlier in the week, but this is what happened since then. Thursday (the 14th) I accepted a job at a linen factory with a Monday through Thursday work week. I told him I could start the following Tuesday (the 19th). I got sick and went to the ER Sunday night and was diagnosed with the flu and strep throat. The doctor told me that I shouldn’t work or physically exert myself for a week. I called him on Monday (the day before I was scheduled to start) and told him this. I asked him if I could start the next Monday. He acted upset and just said, “call me back Wednesday,”and hung up. I called him right back and asked “do I still have a job?” He said again, “call me Wednesday and we will go from there.” Anyway I call him this morning (Wednesday) after having not slept all night and up all night with my throat on fire.  He said “so what’s your situation did you go back to the doctor or what?” I said, “no I didn’t I’m still really sick and can start Monday.” He said, “I’ll just be honest this looks really bad on you and I’m going to have to think about this, call me back Monday and I’ll let you know. People go into Walmart everyday and they’re all contagious and if you listen to the doctors you won’t ever work.”He hung up and I called him back and said,” sir, no offense, but I really need to know something by Monday.” He said, I SAID TO CALL ME BACK MONDAY!” And hung up. I lost my temper and called him back and said, “ don’t worry about the job man, if you can’t understand someone getting the flu I don’t want to work for you anyway and hung up.” Does this look bad on me? I may have burned a bridge but I didn’t want to keep calling and calling and calling not knowing if I had a job or not.",

    "text": "The worst, most backward day of my life I’m 20 years old and a sophomore in college. I didn’t get my period yet this month so over the weekend I decided to take a pregnancy test and it turns out I’m pregnant. I knew I was going to terminate the pregnancy immediately since I’m in no position to care for a child at this point in my life. I called my boyfriend, my parents, and my best friend, and they were all supportive of my decision. After crying and getting over the shittiness of the situation, I made an appointment for a non surgical (medical) abortion. The appointment was for today, so this morning I called an Uber (I don’t have a car on campus) and headed to the clinic which was an hour away. \n\nMy Uber driver seemed immediately uncomfortable and asked if we were going to a planned parenthood. I said no (which was the truth), we were just going to a doctors appointment. Still, he seemed uncomfortable. “Is it an abortion clinic?” The color drained from my face; how could he know? I just put the address of the doctor in, and there was nothing in the name that would imply it was an abortion clinic.  He stared at me, waiting for an answer, but I was too shocked to reply. I couldn’t believe this was happening, and now I was trapped in the car with this guy for the next hour. “You know,” he said, “you’re going to regret this decision for the rest of your life.” He started telling me about the procedure, what it was like, telling me how horrible it was. “There’s so much they don’t tell you. You’re making a mistake”. He brought up his wife, who was 5 months pregnant, but trailed off. I just sat there in silence. We were driving through rural land, miles from any kind of house or storefront. I prayed he wouldn’t hurt me.\n\nWe got about halfway there when he suddenly pulled over on the side of the road. “I’m sorry, I can’t take you any farther than this. You won’t find another Uber out here. I can take you back if you want.” I politely declined and got out of the car. I immediately started calling local taxi companies and asked if they could pick me up. My phone gave me a rough location which I gave them as my pickup address. My Uber driver waited around for about 15 minutes, assuming I’d change my mind. I insisted I was fine and that he should go back and he eventually left. After waiting about 25 minutes, the cab showed up and I got to my appointment (an hour late).\n\nEven thinking about this experience brings tears to my eyes. I can’t believe someone would be this cruel. An abortion is already traumatic enough, and not at all a decision I take lightly. That an older man would corner me and confront me about decisions that are none of his business are astounding. I contacted Uber and I can only pray they take appropriate action. \n\nUPDATE: Thank you everyone for your kind words! The thousands of internet hugs have made a huge difference. I reported him to Uber, and Uber got back to me and refunded the ride and said they were “reviewing his account”. I hope to God he’s fired. \n\nFor all the people who say I deserved this kind of treatment, I have nothing to say to you. I come from a politically conservative family, so I understand being pro life and disagreeing with my decision to terminate my pregnancy. However, the driver was aware of my decision to get an abortion within 10-15 minutes of picking me up from all his probing questions. If he wasn’t comfortable driving me to the clinic, why continue to drive me there until we were stranded? Was it an impulsive decision to leave me by the side of the road, or was it premeditated after he understood our destination? He easily could have left me in my small city and I would have been able to get a different Uber driver and avoided the whole fiasco that ensued. Or, as others have pointed out, he could have simply declined the ride if the destination (and my decision to exercise my rights) were that offensive to him. \n\nI have no issue with him (or anyone else) having a different opinion or with him disagreeing with my choices. But your beliefs do not give you the right to make me feel uncomfortable when I’m completely vulnerable and am relying on you to perform a service I desperately need. \n\nI’m debating posting something in r/legaladvice because I fear the possibility that this could happen again with another young woman (or man) who happened to be doing something or was about to engage in a behavior he personally deemed objectionable. Who else has he stranded, and who else will be stranded yet? \n\nIf there are further developments I will update all of you! Again, thank you so much for your kind words and encouragement. I had no idea my post would blow up like this and it makes me feel good knowing people of the internet have my back. You guys are awesome and this subreddit is amazing. ❤️❤️❤️❤️ \n\nAlso: thank you kind Redditors for the gold, silver and platinum!! I will make sure this never happens to someone else again.\n\nUpdate 2: As I commented below, the reason my parents or boyfriend couldn’t drive me is because they both live in North Carolina while I go to school in New York. My boyfriend couldn’t afford to buy a last minute flight to see me, and because I live in a dorm room with a roommate, there would have been no place for him to stay. My parents did manage to get a last minute flight, but they didn’t get one in time to take me to my appointment.",

The optometrist was in his mid 70s and was super nice through the first half of the exam.

It didn't seem weird, it was just small talk I thought. Then after I went through the 1 no 2 no 1 portion he pushed the optical thing away from my face and leaned in close to me and placed his hand on my knee. I was already getting uncomfortable but then he started lecturing me, saying that I better make my boyfriend marry me or else he would lose interest and leave me and that I was getting old to not be married yet. I cut him off saying, \"I don't want to discuss this\" but I was trapped with him sitting in front of me blocking me form standing up plus he had my glasses so I couldn't see. He was arguing with me saying he was telling me this for my own good and that he was being \"fatherly\" but I didn't back down just kept repeating \"I don't want to discuss this.\" I had to say it 4 times before he stopped, and he had the nerve to respond with, \"well I don't want to discuss it anymore either.\" And I grabbed my glasses and my prescription and left in tears.

    "text": "Finally found the right doctor My daughter (17) has had ongoing health issues for the last 6 years. They started shortly after she started menstruating, but I didn't make that connection until recently. Her period has never been regular, but she sometimes skips 3-6 months in a row. She is always tired, lacks energy, has weird mood swings. She has also had a pretty bad pain in her sides that comes and goes, but is excruciating for her. I have taken her to multiple doctors over the years who all told me that 1) her period being irregular was \"normal\" for a girl in her teens and 2) since she never seemed to be in pain at the time she was seen, they couldn't do anything about it.\n\nOur insurance changed, so we got new doctors. I took her in for her physical, and she casually mentioned the pains she was having to the doctor. He was instantly concerned, and was upset that it had gone so long without any of her past doctors looking into it. We told him about the other issues, and he was concerned about that as well, but said we should take care of her pain first and then look into the other. He ordered ultrasounds to check all of her internal organs and blood tests to check her hormone levels.\n\nAfter 6 years of being brushed off, she found out the pain she gets is caused by greasy food. We changed her diet (as well as ours, and we all needed to eat better, and this was just the catalyst for the change) and the pain is gone. We bought an air fryer, and she can now still occasionally have the fried food she loves without it causing her pain.\n\nIn addition, the blood tests found that she has low estrogen levels.  This wonderful man, the first doctor to actually care about my child, put her on birth control pills to level out her hormones. She is like a new person, and I can't remember the last time she was this consistently happy with life.\n\nI just wanted to share, because I hear stories all the time about doctors underestimating a woman's pain. It happens to me, and I generally just shrug it off because I have a high pain tolerance and I suck at confrontation. It just pisses me off a thousand times more when they do this to a child. She has spent her teen years suffering, and the solution was so simple. It just took one doctor to give a shit.",

    "text": "He makes me cry. I tend to bleed after sex.  I have had myself checked out multiple times (with multiple doctors) and the results are always the same.  There's nothing wrong.  No cancer. No polyps. \nJust use more lube and make sure you are aroused.  \nWell, most of the time,  I still bleed. Sometimes it's a little bit and sometimes it's a lot. \n\nBut that's just backstory. \nThe real reason I made this post is to say that my boyfriend of three years is fucking amazing! He has NEVER commented negatively on that little issue I have.  He has never made me feel like less of a woman. \nSometimes I cry when the bleeding happens. I hate that it happens and that I can't control it. I always think to myself, \"this is it.  This is the time he is going to get sick of it and leave.\" But he doesn't. He just holds me and tells me he loves me no matter what and that he still wants to make love to me.  \n\nI was crying tonight after sex because of the bleeding. I have anxiety and sometimes it triggers it.  He just held me, loved me, and gave me kisses. Then I was crying for a different reason.  I was crying because he loves me no matter what and I feel like the luckiest girl in the whole world.  \n\nI have had my share of shitty relationships.  I have been mentally and physically abused.  I never thought I would meet a good guy that treated me well and respected me.  I finally stopped settling for any asshole that would give me attention and waited for somebody amazing.  And he found me.  Im never letting him go. He's patient, kind, loving, and respectful. \n\nDon't give up. Don't settle. Every woman and man deserves someone that will make them cry happy tears.  \n\n\nUpdate! \nI just wanted to thank everybody who read this post and offered their insights as to why this may be happening to me.  Thank you for all of the support.  \nIt definitely gave me some ideas and im going to be bringing this up with my gyno next visit.  \n\nThis seems like a fairly common problem with woman but it's not talked about often.  \nDon't be afraid to talk to your gyno about ANY problems and if they don't listen get another doctor! :) \n\n\nUpdate! \nWow! Thank you for the gold, kind stranger.  Im glad this post has caught attention.  Maybe it will help others with the same issue.  \n\nAlso thank you for the silver and platinum! \n\nIm so happy that this post had such a wonderful response from both women and men.  Some of you have posted that you have had the same issues and have offered guidance and some of you were encouraged to go to the doctor once you read the post and other's comments.  You realized you were not alone. \nIm glad we all made a difference today. \n\nAnd I showed my boyfriend the post and he was overwhelmed with all the love and support as well.",

    "text": "I just left this review for my gynecologist that I will never go back to - my boyfriend pointed out TV depicts women eternally struggling to find the right ob/gyn -- why is that? I have been seeing Dr. Gynogood since I was 16 years old, she was the only ob/gyn I have ever seen. I first decided I loved her because, despite making me wait naked in stirrups for over 2 hours one time years ago, she frantically ran into the exam room apologizing about an emergency (which happens), with more birth control samples than I have ever seen crammed into one hand, and hilariously helped herself into my purse to put the samples in-- as I was in no position to do so. She is quite the character. But unfortunately, it took 15 years of PMDD, rupturing cysts, and now possibly endometriosis (and may cost my fertility) to realize: she is a horrible, careless gynecologist.\r\n\r\nDr. Gynogood is the kind of doctor to brush everything off, not believe you, send you elsewhere, spend as little time with you as possible, and not respond to questions. I've been told (after a self-initiated ultrasound) that I needed to see a GI because my \"pain might be IBS\" after confirming a ruptured ovarian cyst. I've been sent to a therapist after complaining of extreme cramping pain and heavy flow with crippling depression and anxiety -- that's where her treatment ends, a referral. This is just not somebody treating my gynecological symptoms, and I hate that it took more than half of my reproductive years to determine that.\r\n\r\nAlso, and I hate to be this person, but her staff is incredibly rude and just makes you feel ucomfortable. You better be able to give that pee sample in a timely fashion, and work within their schedule when scheduling or face some major attitude- you know the type?  I always really wanted - and tried- to like this office... their motto \"women treating women\" used to mean something to me for some reason.... at this point give me a big burley bearish man as long as he is qualified, compassionate, and shows some sort of interest in my best interest.\n\nEdit:  Wow, thank you guys so much for your support, I am overwhelmed. I will definitely be getting in with a different doctor :)",

    "text": "Do you ever check in on your grandparents or parents records? I decided to check on mine after a long demise My grandfather passed away approximately a year ago.\n\nToday I decided to go through some of his items. I decided to thumb through some of his previous medical records in a file I found.  \n\nHe is always been pretty private about his medical conditions. Didn't ask for much in terms of advise and....well I didn't want to ask too much since he didn't want to talk about it. He would always want to drink a Lone Star when I would come visit him and bullshit with me. So, we drank beer, ate some cheese, and talked about life / women / guns / cattle / religion (The Texas pentad as we can call it) .  He was 87 when he passed away, had COPD on 4 L of home O2, A. fib, CAD with previous stents.\n\n\nWhen I entered medical school and throughout my training his COPD really started advancing.  He spent the last 3 to 4 years of his life more or less bedbound and could only walk between the couch and the bed without significant shortness of breath.\n\n\nThumbing through the records were a bit eye-opening.  It looks like his primary care doctor was more or less giving him monthly to semi-monthly methylprednisolone injections, he had a sleep study done, he had 5 echoes outpatient, an MRI brain for tremors in his last year, he had for stress test EVERY YEAR in the last 4 years of his life, and had a few CT scans of the chest when he had bronchitis.  Keep in mind, he could not walk more than 50 yards.\n\nSo with this I couldn't help but think of how everything could have went so wrong.\n\nI remember having end of life discussions briefly while talking about religion with him and he would always tell me, he is ready when it is his time to go. But looking at the advanced directives portion of the primary cares note.....this part is left blank. \n\nEven at the end of life this man was ready to go but had only talked about end of life care with my mother and my grandmother. My mother happened to have MPOA. \n\nHe fell, broke his hip and you all know the rest of the story. He was then intubated, was hard to get off the vent, sent to a LTAC and for weeks my family argued over how things would go while the brothers and sisters of my mother filed lawsuits against my mother since she was MPOA and my grandmother did not want to make a decision since they claim they never heard those wishes and that he was on benzos when he filled out any legal paperwork. Some of them kept leaning on data like his stress test looked good a year ago or his MRi brain was perfect a year ago.\n\nIn the end, my grandfather died of pneumonia, never woke up, and it ripped a family apart. Not to mention about 2 months worth of ICU stay.\n\nI tried to speak up during this but only got pushed away and eventually legal contacts from their lawyers to basically stay out of this or else risk being sued and even a phone call where he threatened to report me to the board for offering medical advise without being the attending physician. \n\nLooking through the bills from the hospital stay that medicare paid for, it totaled well over 200k for the last month of his life. That doesn't include the stress tests that were done and all the other Rxs he had prior to his death.\n\nThis whole situation has really hit home for me for my elderly patients. Now I don't wait to their annual physical to ask about advanced directives. I have seen first hand how it ripped an extended family apart and caused the slow painful death of a man who for years would tell me and my mother that he didn't want that.\n\nI don't blame any particular individual in this case. Everyone including myself could have done better and in a way contributed to the eventual outcome. I just wanted to share my story for you fellow docs can put a bit of realness to what happens when shit isn't documented and hopefully it might make us all take a second look rather than clicking that button (discussed advanced directives with patient to hit those medicare metrics).",

    "text": "Dear Outpatient Physicians: Can You Please Stop Frightening Your Patients with Asymptomatic Hypertension? I need to speak out to the community in order to get something off my chest.\n\nI've seen too many patients sent to the ED for treatment of their asymptomatic hypertension.  I don't mind seeing your patients on an urgent basis, assuming that you are truly concerned that may have an emergency condition or if you believe they need inpatient treatment.  However, I don't like it when you force patients to come to the ED with scare tactics.\n\nRecently, I've been presented with many patients sent to the ED simply for an elevated blood pressure reading in the absence of any worrisome symptoms or signs.  To make matters worse, these patients have been told a variety of alarmist proclamations, such as: \"you're going to have a stroke,\" \"that's heart attack level blood pressure,\" or \"you're going to have an aneurysm.\"  One such patient was actually told that she was having a stroke, based on her blood pressure reading alone in the absence of any focal neurological deficit.  One such patient was actually \"stroke alerted\" by my triage nurse (despite not having any true neurological complaints), which caused a tremendous waste of time and resources, not to mention the potential for harm to the patient.\n\nNaturally, these patients are terrified.  They trust their outpatient physician and are skeptical when I tell them that hypertension is just a number.  It takes a lot of time and effort to talk these patients down and help them recognize the actual importance of long term control of their blood pressure.  Many are slow to understand the idea that a rapid drop in their blood pressure is more likely to cause an actual stroke and that a high blood pressure alone is not going to cause a stroke in the short term.\n\nIf you are actually concerned that your patient is suffering from a \"hypertensive emergency\", please send them directly to the ED.  (There is no such entity as \"hypertensive urgency.\")  That's why we exist.  However, please don't use the ED as an \"easy button\" to avoid actual assessment of your patient or to avoid a conversation with your patient.  It's easy enough to find out if the patient is suffering from any symptoms that might be attributable to a hypertensive emergency; if they are not, and there are no focal neurological deficits, then it is safe for you to refer that patient to their primary care physician for sane and rational treatment of their essential hypertension.  If you are a primary care physician yourself, it's pretty simple to ascertain whether or not it is safe to manage that patient's hypertension in clinic with a few minutes of interview on the phone.  Hypertensive emergencies are not subtle; their manifestations are dramatic.\n\nIf you are in doubt, feel free to send these patients to the ED for evaluation.  However, please do not dramatize the risks.  No one is going to have a stroke because they delayed treatment of their hypertension by a few days, weeks, or months.  No one will have a heart attack if they delay starting HCTZ by a fortnight.  Your patient is not going to have a brain aneurysm in the next hour, even if their systolic is 200.  (Coincidentally, most of the asymptomatic hypertension patients I see are sent to the ED because their systolic is greater than 200 or their diastolic is greater than 100; funny how 190 seems so much less threatening than 202.)  When you terrify your patient, you make my job much harder because I have to talk them back down from the cliff while also trying to encourage them into taking their chronic asymptomatic hypertension seriously.\n\nIn case you're thinking it--no, a headache is not a sign of \"end-organ damage.\"  A headache with focal neurological deficits or decreased level of consciousness may be, but a simple tension or migraine headache is not.  Please dig a little deeper in the history before you tell a patient that they are going to die from their headache and that they need immediate emergency department care.  \n\nPatients ought to be sent to the ED based on their symptoms, not isolated numbers.  Someone with a BP of 88/40 who is afebrile, alert, oriented, and well appearing is probably not in shock but rather has a small upper arm.  An otherwise asymptomatic and healthy adult with cold fingers and an SpO2 of 88% is probably not dying.  An athlete with a resting pulse of 40 BPM is not in symptomatic bradycardia.  The otherwise healthy young man with a partial RBBB observed on his ECG is not in heart failure.  The patient who was incidentally found to have a 13K WBC on routine labs is not in sepsis.  The guy with an oral temperature of 94.4F that was obtained after drinking cold water does not have hypothermia.  In each case, we keep the clinical scenario in mind when interpreting the data.  Blood pressure is no different.\n\nI understand when a patient themselves freaks out at a high blood pressure reading or when a \"nurse line\" instructs a patient to come to the ED for their asymptomatic hypertension.  In those cases, no one who knows better is present to weigh the evidence and offer medical advice.  However, when I see a patient referred by an actual physician for asymptomatic hypertension, it disheartens me.  As doctors, regardless of our specialty, we should know better and we should take the time to actually assess our patients.  This is something that everyone who went to medical school ought to know, regardless of your specialty.  You don't need to keep up to date on the latest in blood pressure management or other primary care topics, but you ought to understand the difference between a true \"hypertensive emergency\" and asymptomatic hypertension.  \n\nIn conclusion, please take the time to actually assess your patients and be honest with them.  A few minutes of additional history, even over the phone, can save countless hours of a patient's otherwise wasted time, the efforts of emergency department staff, thousands of wasted dollars in resources, and, most importantly, your patient's mental anguish.  If you just want me to start your patient on HCTZ for their essential hypertension because your clinic is booked out three months in advance, go ahead and send them to me, but please don't terrify your patient with the idea that they are going to stroke out unless they are treated immediately.  (I want to add that the worst offenders are not primary care doctors, but rather specialists and proceduralists who don't know what to do with hypertensive patients.) \n Don't do this for me or my nurses--do it for the sake of your patients and their trust in you (you're going to look silly after they learn from me that their brain isn't going to explode due to their asymptomatic hypertension, regardless of the number).  \n\nThank you for humoring my long winded rant.\n\n(As an aside, I hate the term \"hypertensive emergency\" just as much as \"hypertensive urgency.\"  It makes it seem like the blood pressure is the primary problem, when it is not.  \"Hypertensive emergency\" just means a medical condition in which blood pressure management is an important consideration.  You cannot have an \"hypertensive emergency\" without the underlying emergency condition, such as an aortic dissection, aneurysmal SAH, acute heart failure, renal failure, eclampsia, brain herniation, or stroke.  The disease that gets closest to an actual \"hypertensive emergency\" is malignant hypertension, which is a rare presentation seemingly driven by the elevation in blood pressure.  In all others, the hypertension is driven by the underlying pathology.)",

    "text": "A question from a pharmacist to PCPs regarding controls Hello everyone, I’m new to this subreddit so please excuse me if this isn’t the right place to post this discussion. I’ve been practicing as a pharmacist for about a year and a half at this point and wanted to hear from prescribers their perspective on continual monthly prescribing of narcotics/benzos. I see these as two different but linked issues, but will address them differently.\n\nBenzos: When I see a patient on straight Xanax 1-2 mg TID, with no other supportive psych meds, a huge red flag shoots up. My understanding is for the vast majority of situations, benzos should not be the backbone of therapy for anxiety. SSRI/SNRI and/or buspirone should be the backbone (I know there are other pharmacological classes like bupropion that can be tried as well). However time after time I see benzos dished out like candy. I spent about 30 mins talking to a patient yesterday about her therapy and she said her appointments consist of her coming in, her doc asking if she takes her meds and if things are ok, and then writing a script for more Xanax. Why isn’t there an active attempt to deescalate to a safer agent? Is there a fear the patient won’t come back? Is there just too much hassle?\n\nOpioids: Dear god the amount of issues revolved around opioids are enough to make a sane man crazy. I have multiple patients that will call starting about a week out for their next fill of hydrocodone and ask daily “When can I get it? When did I get it last? Can I get it early (I fill 2 days early already), did the doctor send it in?” This will repeat monthly. I’m just curious if they call y’all the same amount. Anyways, I have some patient with obvious pain issues or cancer patients, this is not about them. This about the able bodied 40 year old dudes that have been unemployed for a decade and have nothing better than to try to score narcs. Why continue writing for them 1 q 4h prn QD? Why is there no plan to deescalate? I’ve seen some theorize that this type of prescribing is an easy guaranteed pay check every month because these patients will come back for their “appointments”. I’m hoping this isn’t true.\n\nTo summarize my questions:\n\nWhy are benzos used so commonly as monotherapy for anxiety?\n\nWhy do I never see any attempt (besides 1 patient who underwent successful surgery), to deescalate opioids?\n\nThe patients with obvious drug seeking behavior. What do you do to put a stop to it?\n\nI hope none of this came out accusatory. I honestly want to hear your side. I have a corresponding responsibility as a pharmacist, and believe me I have refused to fill and dismissed patients who refuse to follow pain management/psych plans. But ultimately they can just walk down the street and fill elsewhere.\n\nEdit: Thank you for my first gold :)!",

    "text": "I patient died and I need to talk about it. Today my patient died. \n\nI came onto the floor and night shift was frantic. Phones ringing, call lights alarming, papers all over the place. Not a good sign. I get report for three patients from one nurse, then find another nurse for the other 2 reports. Let’s call her Jen.\n\nJen gave me report on one patient- he’s fine, stable, peacefully asleep. But the second patient... this poor man. Jen gives me report on Jerry (fake names of course), informing me that he has come in on hospice and is suffering from a severe cancer diagnosis. My eyes flicker over to Jerry in the bed, he is tachypneic and pale, his eyes rolling in the back of his head as he moaned in pain. Jen tells me that he’s only been here for about an hour and a half. No family is here yet. No admit can be done as he is unable to communicate. He is alone and suffering. \n\nJen proceeds to inform me that although the doctor has seen him and it is clear that Jerry is on comfort care, no orders are in the computer. No pain meds, no palliative consult, and no code status. With an undetermined code status, the patient will be treated as a full code and will be resuscitated if he arrests. Jen shrugs, tells me good luck, and leaves for the day. \n\nThe first thing I do is call the doctor. He answers after a few rings and manages to groan out, “This is doctor Smith.” Clearly I have interrupted his sleep. “Hi Dr. Smith,” I say politely. “It’s aaaaasowenyaaa from med-surg. I have your patient in room nine that was admitted from the ER this morning, and we don’t have a code status on him. Can you please put in that order along with the comfort care procedures as well?”  The doctor sighs loudly and says, “Why can’t you just put it in yourself? He is a DNR.” I take a deep breath. This is a doctor that won’t do anything for himself if he doesn’t have to. I close my eyes and say, “Look, only doctors are qualified to put in a code status so I really need you to do that. I can do the comfort care if you really need -“ but Dr. Smith interrupts me and says, “I’m busy right now I’ll do it later.” Now I’m upset. This is not the first time I’ve had to confront him like this. “Dr. Smith, if this patient dies and you wait to put in that order then I am required to do CPR. I have to do CPR on a frail old man who is about the take his last breath, whose body is riddled by cancer. Please. Put in the order.” He finally agrees. \n\nSo I sit and click refresh on my computer a hundred times waiting for that DNR to pop up, but it doesn’t. At this point my patient is getting worse, he is breathing less and just looks like he’s in agony. I tell my supervisor and she immediately calls Dr. Smith. Another 10 minutes passes. Finally! The order pops up.\n\nI draw up 4mg of morphine (that’s all I can give so far) and practically run into the room. Now I feel it’s safe to give this narcotic without fear of my patient dying. But he is still. Alive, but still. A woman sits at his bedside now, her eyes red and puffy. “What the hell is happening to my husband?” she manages to choke out. I get a lump in my throat but swallow it down. “You must be Sara. I am so sorry to meet you under these circumstances.” She scoffs as a flood of tears roll down her face. “Let me explain what’s going on,” I begin, but she interrupts me. “He shouldn’t be in this much pain! How could you let this happen? I want to speak to the director of the hospital. I’ve worked in hospice for years and I know he should never be in this much pain. He was fine yesterday! What’s going on?” I take another deep breath. At this point it’s only 8:30, I’ve been on shift for a hour and already I feel the yearn to run home, to leave this place. But I stay. I explain that without the DNR order, if I pushed IV morphine and Jerry’s respiration’s stopped, that I would have to resuscitate him. She relaxes a bit, shakes her head but agrees that Jerry would not have wanted that. I tell her I am so sorry, that I will do everything I can now to make him comfortable, that I am so incredibly sorry for the delay in pain meds. \n\nI step out of the room after settling Jerry and stare at the wall. My heart aches for Sara. This is not the first spouse she has lost and I did not make it any easier for her. Why can’t doctors just put in their fucking orders?\n\nI take some time to round on two of my patients before the call light goes off in room nine. I knock quietly and enter, and immediately I know. Jerry is gone. Sara glances at him then back at me, her eyes desperate for hope, for a little more time. I step out and grab another nurse to assess with me. We both listen for one minute, but there is nothing. No vital signs, no heartbeat. He is gone. I force my eyes to meet Sara’s. Shake my head and say, “I’m sorry. He’s dead.” \n\nThe lump rises back into my throat as his wife gently kisses his head. “You are my best friend,” she whispers. She cradles his head softly and begins to sob, begging him to come back. I stay for a minute with my hand on her shoulder, but its clear she just wants to be alone with her husband. I politely show myself out and tell her that I will call the chaplain and that if she needs anything to just ask. I walk into the bathroom and lose it.\n\nThat patient died a prolonged and painful death. He suffered when he shouldn’t have. His care was delayed because a doctor was too lazy to do his fucking job and put in a simple yet critical order. His last moments with his wife were in agony and that could have been prevented. I work in med-surg, I don’t see comfort care  often, but I know enough to say that Jerry died an unjust death. \n\nThe lump in my throat still won’t go away.\n\nEdit: wow, thank you all so so much for the support and encouragement. i’m trying to keep up with replying but there’s so many of you! i was not expecting all the love. thank you reddit.\n\nEdit 2: the title was supposed to be “my patient died”, guess i was still frazzled when writing it",

    "text": "If you’ve ever wondered what exactly it takes to lose a nursing license- I got you. Here’s what I learned from researching BON discipline reports, from states where it’s public info. Good reminder of what not to do **Edit/tl;dr** just read the bullet points if you only want the crazy stories :)\n\nI have seen this question and similar ones pop up on allnurses and on reddit before: \"How do you actually lose a nursing license\"? Some of them have been from new grads who are nervous and want to know how punitive the BON will be if they slip up as a new nurse. I have seen some commentors in those threads recommend looking up public disciplinary action reports, and I have waayyyyy too much free time right now so tonight that's what I did. Some things surprised me a lot, some didn't. I learned a lot of helpful lessons and thought I'd share what I found for anyone curious. This post breaks down each type of disciplinary action a nurse can get and some interesting examples I found of real cases. This is gonna be long, y’all...I’m sick and I ain’t got shit to do.\n\n**DISCLAIMER**: some states’ BON publicly posts disciplinary actions for professional licenses. Each state provides a different level of info, but usually it states the professional’s name and a brief summary of what they did wrong and what action was taken. *Not all states do this*. However, if you have the nurse’s name, looking them up on nursys.com shows very detailed reports of any disciplinary action. Some private info is redacted, but it’s quite detailed and totally public info. *Even though it’s available to the public*, I’m not trying to dox anyone or encourage a witch hunt, so I’m not including names here. I’m breaking this post up into categories based on the type of disciplinary action, in descending order from most serious to least. Definitions are based on my state and may vary slightly in other states. “Most common offenses” aren’t official statistics- they are just the patterns I saw from reviewing eight months of data. It’s not all-inclusive by any means and actions are decided on a case by case basis, so similar offenses may result in different discipline.\n\n# REVOCATIONS\n\nI have heard/read that typically, true revocation of a nursing license is pretty rare, and you have to *really* fuck up to permanently lose your license. I can assure any of you nervous new grads out there that this is true! Revocations are typically related to recurrent drug issues and/or criminal acts. So, no, your accidental medication error isn’t going to strip you of your license you worked your ass off for.\n\n**What it means**: your nursing license is taken away from you completely and you are prohibited from practicing as a nurse. After three years, you can (usually) file a petition for restoration. I can’t imagine these are often successful, because the BON really reserves revokes for the worst cases. It’s worth noting that I have seen some incidents (the extreme ones) where the nurse had to sign a document agreeing they would never try to be a nurse in this state again, effectively making the revocation permanent.\n\n**Most common offenses leading to revoke:** drug diversion (repeated), criminal charges, abuse/death of a patient, placement on the sex offender registry, sexual abuse (of patients or non-patients)\n\n**Stories/Unique exceptions:**\n\n* Male nurse had his license revoked for an incident where he got belligerently drunk on an airplane before takeoff and got into a physical altercation with another passenger over a sports rivalry. He swore “they started it”, but every other passenger on the plane unanimously testified it was him that was out of control. Takeoff was delayed, and the police had to come get him. He resisted arrest and as a bonus, when they finally did cuff him, they found narcotics in his pockets he didn't have a script for. At the time of this incident, he already had a couple of wrist slaps for drug related offenses under his belt, and it didn't help his case that he underplayed this incident and vehemently denied what every other witness was saying happened. Boom. License gone.\n* LTC ADON revoked/faced criminal charges for multiple incidents of abuse of her patients. It actually states in her documents that the investigators found her to be incapable of realizing the gravity of her actions, which was pretty obvious when they listed every version of events she had told investigators. She lied through her teeth during every interview. She gave 3-5 totally conflicting testimonies regarding 2 separate incidents of abuse, of which there were many. The patients she abused were seriously injured. She is no longer a nurse and not welcome to re-apply to be a nurse in that state (realistically in any state).\n* This one was the craziest by far. An RN got her license revoked for trying to hire a hitman to kill the wife of a man (coworker no less!) that she was having an affair with. She got caught because a news team was investigating the dark web for a special or something and somehow came across the hitman website she was using. She paid 12,000 dollars and the website ended up being a total hoax- thank god. The wife is unharmed and this RN paid for it with her nursing license and 12 years in jail.\n\n***trigger warning for the next two stores: abuse***\n\n* This one was just heartbreaking. A LTC LPN lost her license for causing the death of an elderly patient. She put a towel in his mouth and a blanket over his head and left him; he died later that day. He also had a C.Diff infection that she didn’t inform the doc about. That’s all the details I could find- couldn’t find what her criminal charges were but I’m certain she had some.\n* This one the most gut-wrenching of all. A homecare RN got her license revoked for *multiple* cases of assault and battery of minors. It appears she worked with special needs children. Specifics of most of these cases are omitted, but one goes into detail. The patient was a small disabled child with a mental age of 2. The RN was caught on the nanny cam punching the child in the stomach, throwing him around, shaking him, slapping him, yelling verbal abuse at him, and sexually assaulting him. She also went entire shifts giving him no food or water at all. Just makes me sick to my stomach. She faced criminal charges as well, obviously.\n\n# Suspensions\n\n**What it means:** you can’t work as a nurse until the suspension is up. It can be set for a time frame (ex: 5 years, or 30 days) or it can be indefinite, meaning that you have to file a petition to have it restored and prove that your suspension should end. Once it ends, you might not be out of the woods yet, because you might get put on probation. The state can issue an immediately effective suspension if they believe you are an imminent danger to others. With this kind of suspension, you cannot work as a nurse again until you have had a formal hearing.\n\n**Most common offenses leading to suspension:** failure to pay taxes, failure to pay child support for more than 30 days, not adhering to probation, not completing continuing education, marijuana. Suspensions are also immediately issued if the BON determines the nurse presents a danger to patients; examples of these cases include substance abuse, sexual/physical abuse of patients, etc (all the really really bad stuff).\n\n**A note about marijuana:** I have seen positive marijuana/thc/cannabinoids listed as the cause for both suspensions and probations- seems it can go either way. Unless you are in Oregon, Washington, or New Hampshire, the BON does not care if you have a medical marijuana card. It is still against federal law, so they can still get slam you for it. If you fail a drug test for weed, you may just get fired, or you may get reported to the BON too. I have known of a lot of nursing students who mistakenly think that if you have a card, you won’t get in trouble; unfortunately this is not true. Also, unfortunately, despite CBD being legal, it is possible that it could contain enough THC to make you have a positive drug screen. Not likely, but possible and it does happen. So if you really want to smoke weed and be a nurse, maybe move to a medical marijuana friendly state or Canada, lol...Or wait until it’s federally legalized.\n\n**Stories/unique exceptions:**\n\n* I found one indefinite suspension for a nurse that documented she did a treatment but not didn't actually do it. Suspension seemed like a bit overkill for this one, but I suppose it depends on how crucial the treatment was and if the documentation was deliberate laziness or a mistake. Usually with things that appear more minor on the surface, there is more to the story if you dig. I couldn’t find any more info on this one, though. Worth mentioning that the nurse’s license is currently listed as unencumbered, so maybe it got cleared.\n* Indefinite suspension for a nurse who failed to provide aide to a patient who had a bone protruding out of his leg. I looked into this one because...wtf. As I found out, the story gets so much worse. The nurse came into this patient’s room to answer a call light. The patient was in bed, and sure enough, their bone was protruding from their leg. The nurse left the patient’s room and did not report this to the physician for another *three* hours. The patient was rushed to the hospital and needed a blood transfusion. The patient died less than a week later.\n* Two cases of suspensions due to failure to administer CPR.\n* One quite sad suspension for a nurse who showed up to work on her day off and was behaving strangely- seeing things other people did not, speaking incoherently, laughing at inappropriate times. She took off and her coworkers called police to do a wellness check, after which she was taken into psychiatric care. I’m assuming in this case she could get her license reinstated with successful treatment of her illness.\n\n# Probation:\n\n**What it means:** you can continue to work as a nurse, but your ability to do so is conditional on you abiding by restrictions, terms, conditions, and monitoring decided by the board. You’ve probably heard of drug diversion programs before- this would be an example of probation. The terms of probation depend on the defense, and they can be a real pain in the ass, but the bright side is you get to keep working as a nurse. Probation can be for a set time frame, meaning it automatically expires in x amount of days/months/years, or it can be indefinite, meaning you will have to plead your case and prove that it should be ended.\n\n**Most common offenses leading to probation:** drug/alcohol abuse, DUI, drug diversion, frequent narcotic count discrepancies/charting discrepancies, showing up to work impaired\n\n**Stories/unique exceptions:**\n\n* A nurse got a five (!!) year probation for watching porn on a company laptop. It did not specify if this nurse was at work at the time, just that the laptop belonged to their employer. I was intrigued by this and did some more digging and it appears maybe this was taken back because this nurse now appears to have an unencumbered license.\n* I read two cases of probations due to nurses submitting misleading documents to their employers. One nurse changed the year on a CPR card that had expired and had submitted it to her employer trying to pass it off as still valid. Another nurse got busted for doing the same thing with a pre-employment TB test. I think both ended up with  probation for years.\n* A school nurse got two years of probation after being fired for not giving a student the correct amount of insulin. Another school nurse got probation for giving a student who was having an asthma attack prednisolone; they were dissolvable tablets and he put it in a glass of water for the student to drink instead of putting it under his tongue. He also made an insulin error with another student.\n* There was one case of a probation due to falsifying patient records and not maintaining adequate records. Couldn’t find any more info than that.\n* A year long probation for a nurse who was deemed unfit for duty because of an adverse reaction to a prescribed medication. Couldn’t find any more information on this one, seems strange to me. Her license is now listed as unencumbered, though.\n\n# Refuse to renew status:\n\n**What it means:** you won’t be able to continue practicing as a nurse once you pass the expiration date of your license, because the board won’t allow you to renew until you file a petition.\n\n**Most common offenses leading to refuse to renew status:** not informing the BON of a criminal conviction (I didn’t know this- you *have* to report all convictions to the board asap!), getting in trouble with another state’s BON, not reporting termination from a job to the board, refusing a drug screen\n\n**Stories/unique exceptions:**\n\n* An LPN got a refuse to renew status for using RN credentials when she didn’t have an RN license. She has her RN now and that license is unencumbered. Happy ending?\n\n# Reprimand:\n\n**What it means:** this is the BONs “smack on the wrist”; it’s the least “serious” discipline they can give. You can keep working as a nurse with few/no restrictions, but you are monitored and may have to complete some education. While it’s never happened to me, I’ve browsed a lot of forums regarding nurse’s personal experiences with reprimands and will share my takeaway. There is good news and bad news about a reprimand. The good news: you can keep working as a nurse and while you’ll be monitored, you usually won’t have restrictions. The bad news: it still shows up on your license - to my understanding - typically forever. Future employers (and internet strangers like me) will be able to read all about exactly why you got in trouble. You will have to explain this every time you apply for a new job. Again, good news and bad news here. If your reprimand is over something minor, and you are a strong advocate for yourself, employers are more likely to give you a chance. However, if your reprimand is damning, that info is out there forever and easy to find, so you may run into some trouble. Even so, a reprimand is not a death sentence to a nursing career.\n\n**Most common offenses leading to a reprimand:** pleading guilty to a crime (ranges from felonies to more minor things like shoplifting), not reporting termination from a job to the board, med errors, charting errors, failure to provide appropriate care (unintentionally)\n\n**Stories/unique exceptions:**\n\n* I have seen two cases of nurses getting reprimanded for increasing a medication dose without a doctor’s order. One specified that it was medication was insulin.\n* A few cases of LPNs getting reprimands for working with an expired license. I was surprised that 1) the employer/facility didn’t catch this and 2) that the result was only a reprimand.\n* There was a case of a DON who got reprimanded for not appropriately staffing a facility. I looked up the details of this one and “understaffed” is an understatement; it was really bad. The reason it became an issue with the board is because for over an hour, a whole hall was completely unattended by a nurse or an aide, and in that timeframe, a patient died. The patient was only found when the next shift came in.\n* There was a case of a charge nurse getting reprimanded for “bullying” the nurses she was overseeing.\n* A nurse got reprimanded for falling asleep on the job. I was curious about this one, so I read the full report and it turns out she did this *many* times. She worked night shift. The other nurses had to wake her up, but they let it pass the first time. Then it just continued to happen. Her coworkers started to document it and stated she fell would asleep for up to 2 hours at a time to the point of snoring, and also took an hour long break one shift.\n* Home care nurse got reprimanded for charting that she did home visits on a patient...who was in the hospital at the time and most definitely not at home. She forged the patient’s electronic signature as well by copying and pasting an old one.\n* Nurse got reprimanded for filling a patient’s pill box with an old dose of a diuretic instead of the increased dose the provider ordered. The patient was unharmed. Added to this reprimand, however, was a statement that the nurse had accepted a glass of homemade wine from a patient’s family member towards the end of her shift.\n* A nurse got reprimanded for accessing the electronic medical records of a patient that wasn’t assigned to her. States she did this “for personal reasons”. A lot of my classmates in nursing school didn’t know about this one, so it is definitely worth mentioning: Epic tracks what charts you access and even how long you access them for. Don’t get caught with your nose somewhere it shouldn’t be.\n\n**IN SUMMARY**\n\nI spent way too much time doing this but I do feel I learned a lot, and think other nurses and nursing students would benefit from hearing these stories and researching more on their own. There were things I found in this process that I didn’t even know you could get in trouble for, and it is definitely a great reminder for me to be more careful in my own practice. If you guys know more about this than me, feel free to correct me on stuff!\n\nAnd if you’re a worrier and feel like you live in constant fear over losing your license over an honest mistake, take a breather. The worst the “honest mistake” people got that I saw were reprimands, which are certainly not career ruining especially if you didn’t intend any harm. But even then, probably 90% of those reprimands were the result of multiple/repeated incidents or blatant negligence.\n\nSo be vigilant, be *honest with your BON* if you make a mistake (bc audits happen and you do not want them finding out on their own), but don’t get bogged down by worrying. It takes more than an honest mistake to even get a wrist slap, and you have to really try to lose your license for good. Just keep being the awesome nurse that you are <3\n\nSincerely,\n\na bored LTC nurse who is suddenly wondering if research nursing is my true calling 😂",

I've been teaching 10 years and God knows I've run into quite a few weird quirks, but this one just blew my mind.\n\nSo I let my kids drink in my classroom as long as we're not doing a lab, and the drink can be closed.  I noticed one of my kids had a yellow \"sauce\" packet that he kept in his mouth.  I live in the south, so Sweet Tea is a big thing everywhere.  I saw the yellow packet and assumed he was \"sipping\" on lemon juice the whole time in class.  That's weird in and of itself, but WHATEVER.  I even thought maybe he had an issue where he needed vitamin C so he was doing something the doctor recommended and was nursing a tiny packet of lemon juice to meet his requirements.  \n\nSo the other day I noticed he had a big stack of the packets empty on his desk.  (The kid obeys the rules and doesn't throw his stuff away until the bell rings and he heads out to his next class.)  I saw the big pile while he was doing work and just walked up next to him and motioned for him to throw his stuff away.  I asked him, jokingly, \"so do you have scurvy or something, man?\"  I was just joking, and I honestly didn't think he'd understand what scurvy was, so he looked up and said, \"huh?\"  At this time I finally look closely at the little yellow packets.  Turns out, this whole time, he is sitting there eating pure mustard.  NOTHING ELSE.  My rational human brain saw yellow packets and just assumed he was sucking on lemon juice the whole time.  That's what I get for trying to rationalize a teenager's behavior.  The kid goes into the lunchroom during breakfast and gets like 10 of the mustard packets and sits there chowing down.\n\nI was just so flabbergasted, I just couldn't say anything that I knew would hurt his feelings.  The kid is kinda odd anyway, but nothing really to worry about.  (And I know this isn't something to worry about either.)  That being said.  WTF?!  This kid comes in, almost every day and sits and eats 5-10 mustard packets.  I've met the mother; I don't think there's an issue where he's not getting fed at home.  \n\nI just... I had to tell someone this, and I felt like you guys might get a laugh out of a kid constantly eating pure mustard.  Do any of ya'll have some students' odd quirks?  I'd love to hear them!",

    "text": "I’m leaving my job. I’m heartbroken.’ Long story short: \n\nI love my school but I don’t have many friends or family in my town, I’ve developed a  health problem and am out right now and we don’t know when I could even return, plus I cant live healthily with just two good friends in the whole city, one of whom is moving in January. The kids need stability more than they need me, and he school needs to be able to post a full-time position. I’m out, effectively immediately. My heart is broken. \n\nLong story long: \n\nI went to a college pretty far from my hometown, I did my student teaching at a high school there and got offered a job there right out of school. So I stayed. I never meant to stay in that twin for a long time, I always wanted to move back to Chicago. But I loved that school and I wasn’t married yet, no kids of my own, and it was easier than searching for a new job and apartment! And I loved my students. \n\n\nMy first year was great. Hard, but great, and man, did those kids learn. I teach foreign languahe, so I’d get those kids again, and I couldn’t wait to expand on the foundations I’d built. Plus, my school is amazing and the kids are so talented. I was so excited to stay. \n\n\nSecond year I had a traumatic event re-hash itself that sent me into a depressive episode. I’ve been on antidepressants since I was 15 and they’re very well managed,  i but this was horrible. I missed about a month, first being depressed and then in treatment. We got my head sorted out eventually, still on antidepressants. Second semester I was better mentally and emotionally but I got a reoccurring UTI in about March that spread into a kidney and bladder infection that plagued me March to May. It hurt. It hurt so bad and I got terrible terrible headaches with it. I missed so much work and some days I couldn’t form sub plans. I told my kids what to do when I was gone but somehow it slipped through thre cracks. I made it through the year but I knew I could do better.\n\n\nI debated coming back home after my second year, this summer. Two full years out of college and I had few friends left in that town. But I wanted to be there for my kids, most of whom really liked me, some of whom  explicitly told me they only signed up for my subject because of me. I decided it’d be my last year, 2019-2020. I was gonna do the best and last year, go out with a bang. I prepped and revised this summer. Also, I got a staph infection, most likely from Disney World or the airplane to Disney World. That infection came back twice over he summer but went away by school starting. Also, we found out that my roommate/friend got a fellowship (a really good one!! In her field!! Doing wildlife rehab!! In a beach town!! PAID!!) and would be moving out in January. I tried and failed to find a new roommate and was getting used to the idea that I’d live alone. \n\n\nSwcghol started. I had some former students and new students. I was so excited! We started reviewing and I was blown away but what one second-year student had managed to remember. It was gonna be a good year. \n\n\nMy fuckin staph infection came back the night of the fourth day of school. I got on a strong, string, strong antibiotic  but I couldn’t go in— you can’t set foot in a school with several-antibiotic-resistant staph on your arms. I missed three days. I’d be okay. The infection cleared but I was gonna finish my course of antibiotics. I was still, of course, on my antidepressant. \n\n\nTwo days later, I was teaching third hour and I suddenly couldn’t feel my legs. I felt dizzy. then my stomach felt numb— like I’d been shot up with Novacane, but everywhere, or like my foot had gone numb, but not pins and needles, just got feeling it, but everywhere. I could feel the numbness rising twward my chest. I emailed the principal, nurse, and two other people while trying to stay calm. I started getting shaky on my feet. \n\n\nThe nurse brought in a wheelchair. We decided to get an ambulance because I couldn’t feel sensation touch with my eyes closed and it was spreading, rapidly. I tried to text my family and roommate but it was gibberish. I had the nurse text my family. I got put on a gurney and loaded in the ambulance. My classroom was right in front of the school, with windows. He last thing I saw was my kids crowded by the window, one girl crying; some with phones.\n\n\nI went to the ER. Got admitted to the hospital eventually. They thought I had something called Serotonin Syndrome, or too much Serotonin, probably from a medication reaction with my string antibiotics or just how weakened my body was by the infection. Full-body numbness, dizziness and motion sickness, difficulty speaking, difficulty with fine motor skills. They needed to take me off my antidepressant and flush Serotonin out of my system. They did. The symptoms got better. \n\n\nThen the anxiety hit me. I spent a full week off of something I’d been on since I was 15 years old. I felt physically nauseous. I shook all the time. I got overwhelmed by the idea of eating an apple— a whole apple that’s a lot of commitmmmet! And whet if I don’t finish the whole thing?? So guilty. I forget stuff constantly. I’m also having issues finding my correct words and doing Adult Daily Living Tasks like cooking or putting food together, remembering the order of stuff to do in the shower, putting food away in the wrong places (a head of lettuce in the pantry.) Writing by hand is hard. Typing is hard. This has taken me about 2 hours, and yes, I can see some of the typos, and I hate them too. And emotionally I’m back to age 15– crying all the time, thoughts of hopelessness, apathy, fear of everything. And I’m not allowed to drive or use cooking utensils unsupervised. \n\n\nI’m staying with my parents now, and I’m in a recovery program and they’re introducing me back on my antidepressants. But it’s gonna be a while. Maybe a month, maybe more. And even if I come back in a month, it’s simply not safe for me to go back in January and live alone (roommate is moving out for her awesome program). \n\nI spoke with my parents. I spoke with my doctor, I spoke with a therapist. I spoke with my principal. \nThe students need stability, a teacher who’s there and will keep being there. I need to be with people who can watch me and in a program to help me get back to normal. This was gonna be my last year. My family and my boyfriend and most of my close friends live in a different city. \n\n\nSo I resigned. Or quit. Or gave notice or whatever. It’s the best decision for me and the school. I am heartbroken, I can’t think of what to say to my colleagues or my kids. I know that my brain is very depressed right now, but even so, this is a damn tough decision. I love that job. I love that school. I love my third hour kid who hand-drew a meme if the day every day last year. I love my students who make up dances to all our weird grammar songs. I love the kids who tell me any and every connection they have to our language, whether that’s a family member, a hair braider they met, or writing on their shampoo bottle. I love making fun of cheesy textbook soap opera videos, and also cheesin’ our whole teaching grammar because it makes kids laugh and when they laugh, they remember \n\n\n. I can’t even think about getting my books out of that classroom. The kids deserve books. I love especially don’t have any idea about what other colleagues will say, or parents. Oh, shitty absent teacher who didn’t give homework and let the students play with Play-Doh, she finally got “sick,” and quit? Good. We hated her anyway. \n\n\nI know this job is tough, but it can be so good. Take a moment today to appreciate all the good things you have. I’ll be going to program and therapy and making plans on how to pack up my old apartment before the month ends so I can break my lease. \n\n\nThanks for reading, if you did. Go do great.",

    "text": "I feel so lost (marrying a teacher) I'm marrying the love of my life in less than a month! I am a 28 yo man who works in engineering, she's a 25 yo woman who teaches 6th grade English. She's been teaching for a few years now in a few different positions at various schools.\n\nI understand how tough it is to start a career. I myself had times when I was working 70 hours a week. And I understand there are elements of teaching that I will never be able to relate too. But her career is putting a huge strain on her mental, and now physical, health. It's starting to even affect me and our relationship negatively.\n\nShe's always questioning if she really enjoys teaching. She insists she doesn't care about the students most of the time, even says she hates them sometimes. She works twice as many hours as I do and gets paid less than half of what I make. The stress has gotten so bad that she has developed severe muscle tension. A doctor prescribed her muscle relaxers and pain killers. So now when she's not grading papers at home, she's passed out from the meds. Her health is not where it should be, and her family tree is filled with cancer, heart disease, diabetes, etc. so it is ESPECIALLY important that she maintains a healthy lifestyle and mental clarity.\n\nI do all the cooking, all the cleaning in our house, I drive us wherever we need to go. And I work 40+ hours a week and have a 2 hour commute every day. I'm starting to feel like our relationship is one-sided.\n\nI was hoping she would get wise advice about work/life balance from more experienced teachers she works with. But when she talks about that with them, all they say is \"My husband doesn't like how much I work either. Men are so clingy\" thus further cementing the idea that work/life balance simply isn't possible as a teacher. My fiance has even said \"This is the life of a teacher. If you don't like it, don't marry me.\n\nI think her defensiveness comes from knowing she can't contribute to our relationship as much as I can right now. I know she loves me, and I know I love her. I have no doubts about marrying her. But the lifestyle we have right now is simply not sustainable, *especially* in a marriage and *especially* when we have kids someday. And if we're struggling with work/life balance *before* we're married I can't imagine it improving after.\n\nAt the moment, she is currently a long-term sub. So my suggestion to her is to simply be a daily sub (which she would be able to do as often as she'd like since we have very big districts around us) after her contract is up. She likes that idea too, but she wouldn't want to do that for too long. My fear is that she has become so distant from her true self that she might not be able to come back to her real self. She is so different than who I know she really is right now. It's like she's a totally different person.\n\nSorry for the long post. I just feel so lost and I don't know where to turn to. I feel so rejected by her, although I know she does not intent to make me feel that way. And I'm so scared for her health. She is ALWAYS having some sort of physical ailment that can be related to stress.\n\nTL;DR\nMy fiance's teaching career is taking over her life and damaging our relationship. I've been as supportive as anyone possibly can imo, but now it's damaging her mental and physical health (and her family tree already has tons of horrible mental and physical health problems). I feel like her entire life exists to support her students, and now I'm starting to feel like my entire life exists to support her students too.",

    "text": "Gems from My Students' Papers My students had to write a short story about a singular moment in their lives. The goal was to focus on sensory details, showing emotions versus telling the reader them, including dialogue, good pacing, and an engaging hook. We spent months doing brainstorming journal writing for them to think of a moment, we looked at tons of examples to help them write, and wrote many drafts in class. I'm grading them now, and as many of the English teachers here know, there are always some gems of hilarity in these papers. I thought I'd include some for your enjoyment:P.S. My students range from ages 15-18:\n\nStudent started his paper:\n\n>\"Hi this is the “true” story of how I lost my dog Rockco so let’s get to it.\" and ended with \"THE END.\" (This was not the last \"THE END\" I would see as my grading progressed)\n\nBeautiful similes such as:\n\n>\"I hear my mom laughing until she turned me over. I looked like the demon from the Conjuring. Then she started screaming...\"\n\nOr these beauty of a beginning:\n\nI was basically conceived with glasses. I was a little sperm cell with black glasses. Then I was a fetus with glasses, skip 8 months I was born.\n\n>\"Wow for being born a month early this is the most attractive person ever.\" My dad said.\"I am a doctor so I am smart, and I agree with that fact.\" Replied the doctor.\"Facts facts facts facts facts.\" My mom added.\n\nAnother from a paper titled: \"Men Ain't S\\*\\*\\*\"\n\n>Sitting at the round table made my cheeks red and my heart racing. My face drops as K--- shows me the gut wrenching image of another “man” on his snapchat. The pale doe eyed boy I thought I could spend the rest of my life with was abruptly turned into a bad taste in my mouth… It tasted like the charred part of a cheap cut of beef that chef accidentally dropped and then just slapped on the grill. It took me a small span of time to realize that my cheap replacement was just a bootleg, counterfeit and uglier version of a overdosed Demi Lovato…\n\nAnother paper was simply titled, \"Who Let the Birds Out?\"\n\nTwo quotes from another student's paper:\n\n>When I rolled down the stairs my dad tried to catch me but it was too late my parents and grandparents got really scared that even my dad got diabetes.  \n>  \n>(Later on:) I would never forget what happen to me because it was furious and in pain what I went thru and my father having diabetes at a very young age and this is my story of what happen to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf people want more I'll post them below as I continue grading.\n\n  \nUPDATE:  \nHere's another. I'm on my third cup of coffee, but is this as hard to read for you all as it is for me?\n\n>My parents and older brother Julio had decided that he would be taking his girlfriend,our older brother Angel,Josue, and Josue’s girlfriend Destiny and my parents would take me, our younger brother Damian, our little sister’s Valeria, Allison \n\n&#x200B;",

    "text": "Is the inability to use your PTO the way you want a good reason to leave an otherwise okay (not great but not terrible) job? I work in the payroll department of a small Midwestern construction company. Lately I feel like I'm having undue stress because even though I get about 80 hours of Paid Time Off every year (plus another 16 hours of personal time/floating holiday hours) I get push back whenever I try to use any of it. \n\nBasically I cannot schedule any PTO in the summer (unless it's on a Friday), during the holidays or....really any days except Friday's and Monday's. And when I do take a day off when I get back to work not only do I have that days work to do but also the work for the day I took off. No one picks it up for me so I'm usually making up the time I was off by working late the rest of the week in order to get caught up. \n\nLike I said this is becoming a real pain in the ass because I'm a family man with a grade school age child and I feel like my career is really limiting the sort of \"family fun time\" I can have. Going on a 2 week vacation in the summer is absolutely out of the question. Hell, I can't even schedule a doctors appointment for myself unless it's on a Friday or Monday and then, as I said, I'm going to come back to a pile of work. \n\nMy problem is that this job pays me well above the average for my area. And to be perfectly honest I'm not sure that \"Shitty PTO Practices\" is a good reason to leave a job that otherwise isn't really that bad. But really it's the pay that keeps me here. I've looked at other jobs on places like indeed.com and very few come close to my salary. \n\nShould I keep looking or should I just suck it up and except that my PTO is never going to something I'll be able to use the way I want to? Oh, and the PTO is \"use it or lose it\" with up to 40 hours being able to carry forward into the next year. Because of the crappy PTO scheduling I carried the full 40 hours forward so I ended up with 120 hours of PTO this year. I ended up using it for a lot of 3 day weekends but I paid for it with long nights. If I could sell back any unused PTO this probably wouldn't be as big of an issue. \n\nSorry for the TL;DR but this has been something that's been weighing on me for over a year.",

    "text": "28 years old student almost a BA in Human Resources but don't like the work field. Feeling lost. What options do I have? Hi everyone,\n\nThis is going to be a bit longer writeup with a few personal details added to the mix; I hope to create a better picture of the situation by doing this.\n\nI am a 28 years old man from West-Europe in need of some career guidance. I live with my gf in a middle sized city with relatively high rent. I've been trying to get my bachelor degree in HR since 2013. I've worked a bit in the work field, but I'm quite sure I don't want to work in HR after I receive my degree.\n\n**Study:** Started Law school in 2011, dropped out in 2013 and started a bachelor in HR (takes 4 years). Still doing this in 2019 and will be in 2020. In 2017 I almost graduated, but I had some issues with writing my thesis and I've had some additional personal issues related to depression, anxiety, family and alcohol, so haven't done any work from 2017 to 2018, except some volunteer work.\n\n**Jobs:** from 2014 tot 2017 I've worked parttime as an advisor at a HR department (administration, advising management, some side projects), but my heart wasn't in it. When I didn't complete my thesis on time in 2017 I lost my job, because they reserved a fulltime job for me and they weren't too happy they had to find someone else because I didn't finish my bachelor on time.\n\nIn 2018 I got a job at a bank as an entry financial advisor/customer service representative with decent hours but a low income. A few months ago in September I decided to write a new thesis and continue my work at the bank, albeit in parttime now.\n\n**Personal:** There are some personal issues. Financial problems (crippling student loans, low income, high rent), my scarred resumé and my mental health. My friends are mostly successful (a handful are doctors, consultants or lawyers) and I notice that my connection to these friends is fading quickly since they're entering such a different phase in their lives, while I'm stuck, thus falling behind.\n\nI do speak with a psychologist about my problems, yet at the end of the day I'm the one who needs to take steps in the right direction. It can often feel like I'm 'too late' and have failed, yet this mindset doesn't get me an inch forward so I try to stay positive.\n\nThe other side is my complete indecision in what kind of work I want to do. The problem I see with HR is the (perceived) lack of added value to a company. I find myself unable to explain why HR is really necessary; companies often see the operational/administrative/law part of HR as a necessity, yet the advising part as superfluous since it's so hard to make the added value measurable and most of the tasks are picked up by the (middle)management.\n\n**So what do I want?**\n\nI'm trying to find out what my options are with a degree in HR. What are my chances on the market? What are my other escape options? I'm interested in the tech sector (but don't think I'm fit for coding and I miss the math fundament) and the subject of sustainability, but mostly with 'adding value', how abstract that sounds. Recruitment and sales are no options.\n\nDoes anyone of you have seen a similar situation or have suggestions to find a way to a different career?\n\nIf you've made it this far: thank you for reading and I hope to find some constructive suggestions :)",

It's raining but it might as well be beach weather for all my feels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackground:\n\nI live in Melbourne, Australia. Needless to say, compared to the US, CS careers are nowhere near as lucrative or as abundant here. While demand is still \\*high\\* compared to other industries, salary range for a graduate ranges from 45k on the lower end and 60k+ for those who top out or luck out. I have been a satanic follower of this sub for the last 6 months as I've been hunting for a software engineer/developer position after graduating from university.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout me. I graduated from one of the more reputable universities in Australia, part of what's known as the \"Group of 8\" here down under. In Finance. Yeah, nothing to do with CS. My whole life, I've never been motivated by anything except computers. I won awards in high school, I started building websites for my friends and family on Weebly and Wordpress. But I was an also flawed. I cared too much about what others thought of me, and I had expectations from my parents I desperately wanted to uphold, and to them - I was destined to be a great, high achieving son: a doctor or a banker. So I caved. I fooled my mind into that pathway while still in high school. Easy enough, except I had to go to university.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's where everything crashed. I was soulless, unmotivated and empty. I had this fake crappy persona about me that lied to everyone about my marks, my ambitions - I looooved finance. It went pretty far. To everyone, I was a 4.0 student, president of a commerce society, with an internship done with a financial behemoth. In reality, I had a 2.5 gpa, was the president of a society I fooled myself into thinking I cared about and an internship where the only thing I developed were dark thoughts about my future. I was disgusted with myself and banking was the worst thing on the planet to me - I learned things that repulsed me ethically from ever wanting to be in that profession.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI leave university in Nov 2018.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to my graduation (with zero offers lined up) and I walk across the stage to shake the hand of a man who presented me with a degree that I didn't want; a ticket to an industry I fucking hated. In the months that followed November, I struggled internally. I had to get out of this profession before I fooled myself into thinking that it was okay to stay - the money makes you comfortable. Cue stumbling across this sub and the one known as the Tech Lead, where I decided to fuck it all and gun for a career in CS, the only thing I had ever had a passion for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere I am at ground zero. No relevant experience. No relevant degree, no qualifications. No money for a bootcamp. No knowledge of the industry. I have the skills of being able to sit in an office - and the ability to stream bullshit out of my mouth - a skill courtesy of the bullshittest industry ever. So with newfound motivation and fear, I started studying anyway. I busted out my old coding notes from when it was a hobby, refreshed my Java, learnt Ruby and Rails, SQL. 12 hours a day. I lived on ramen and fear itself. Studied more than I ever had in university. Brushed up (bullshitted) my resume as much as I could without outright committing fraud. HackerRank, Leetcode, Codewars - my best and only friends. Applying all the while.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd boy, did the rejections roll in. Each new email was a fresh reminder of my empty shell of being. I didn't even count them, but I had to buy a new mouse a few months in. I had to bum off my parents for money, which only increased my self loathing. I couldn't even get a part time job working as admin or at a supermarket - I was rejected by them too (actually not sure the reason for this one). Whirlpool (Australia's version of intern/grad forums) was my homepage. But every time I came back to this sub, I saw a new post from a graduate who struggled to have their patience rewarded but persisted until success. And that kept me going. Every time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSlowly, the phone calls came in, my coding challenges and tests spoke for themselves. And then, the interviews. one after the other. I couldn't even study all day anymore because I would be peppered with interviews. And finally, 6 months of struggle later, the light: offers. 5 of them. 50k, 50k, 55k, 55k.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe last one I received yesterday I had already dismissed, due to what I thought was ghosting. 60k. July start.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sat in my car and cried. Thank you Reddit, for allowing the constant reposts from graduates saying they finally landed a job. Thank you for all the repeated advice, for all the unique problems and requests that kept me coming back to the sub for more motivation and solace that I was not alone. Thank you Tech Lead. I start a new story of my life now. No more lies, just bugs that I will both hate and enjoy fixing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr; No relevant qualifications or experience. Long study, no moneys. Now have moneys and can buy sandwiches instead of making them. Thanks to all reddit.",

    "text": "Need some opinions on micromanagement regarding hours worked Hey CS careers. I have a question for you guys about micromanagement.\n\nI first started as a contractor at my current company 4 months ago with the intention to convert to full time after 6 months as that's how long it would take for my company to be able to get me out from my vendor without having to pay them fees. However, I realized that being a contractor was much more profitable due to certain tax regulations and decided to stay on as a contractor long term which works out for everyone as the company doesn't need to pay benefits or vacation just salary while I get to pay less taxes. My vending company and my previous manager basically just said if you worked the day you bill 8 hours as a full day worked. Sometimes we'd do a bit more than 8 other times a bit less but we typically received glowing feedback and no one really penny pinched the hours. \n\nHowever, recently a new manager came in and it could be due to inexperience as this is his first time in an official management role but he said he's having talks with everyone about being more \"honest\" with hours billed. I can only infer this as he doesn't believe people are working a full 8 hours to the dot and wants to clamp down on what he perceives as dishonesty. I brought up my concerns to him about how in this industry isn't always so black and white with regards to man hours and results and it's often hard to quantify what's billable and what is not. I tried to explain that from my perspective it'd a lot easier for everyone that we just bill 8 work hours for a day under normal circumstances and there's no need to pay overtime for little things unless it's extreme circumstance like the day we spent 12 hours from 4pm to 4am on sunday to support a production launch.\n\nHis response was that if you're working at \"50%\" capacity then that time would count as billable and he wants everyone to keep track on a daily basis accurate to nearest half hour or something (didn't specify how accurate but wants more \"accuracy\"). He admits this straight micromanagement but it's something he wants to do. I asked him what about that one day where I spent 4 hours on call after work monitoring a release but only really spent 30min max on actual work while the rest of it was watching basketball or playing PC games which he said that would count even though it goes against what he just said.\n\nIn the end I asked him what exactly is so bad about what is being done currently which is to just treat everyone like a full time employee and pay 40 hours per week as the default pay. He sounded fairly upset when his response was: \"Well you're a contractor, you should be a salaried employee then if you want that\".\n\nAll in all I'm not happy about this at all. I never considered about hours worked and would happily assist off hours or respond to inquiries at night. Since he mentioned the 50% thing should I just type with 1 hand because that's 50%? Should I be calculating every minute I'm assisting with inquires to bill those hours? Where do I draw the proverbial line? Furthermore, what happens if I go to dentist or a doctor's appointment one day. Does he expect people to keep track of the exact time they left and when they come back? What motivation do I have to work on something faster if I can stretch out half a days work into a full days work? I also have a coworker who has a favourite coffee place about 20 min away and he often takes up to an hour to go there back. Wonder if that'll get clamped down too.\n\nAnyway, I just want to get some other people's opinion. Maybe I'm being unreasonable but I don't see how this can be a good thing for anyone and it just creates stress needlessly for all parties.",

    "text": "6 lookbacks from a 6 month “veteran” in Big4 Audit Wanted to post this for those who are thinking about this career route and what I wish I would have done differently:\n\nI started my short career thus far as a starry eyed, naive new hire and I can say with confidence the first half year has been unreal. I busted my ass through college to work for what many consider a good job at a very “prestigious” firm. I’ve been lucky enough to travel the country (coastal southern town to the biggest city on the west coast to a cold eastern city to back home). I’ve met some awesome people from all over and audited some cool companies. Here’s what I’ve learned in about 180 days on the job that will be so helpful to accounting students and upcoming new hires. \n\n1 - 20% of 25 year olds with CPAs think they’re Gods gift to the accounting world. 10% think they are God himself and the other 70% are quite alright. Finding your crew at your firm is important and your friends from your internship/start class might turn into genuine friends for life (a good takeaway) lucky to have a good group of folks I started with. \n\n2 - the personal sacrifice that I’ve seen for this job is astonishing. In 6 months I’ve seen a grown ass man not go to the doctor until they literally pissed blood yet they continued to work in the waiting room. I’ve seen a second year staff throw up in the clients bathroom from stress. I’ve seen other staff belittled for not knowing something that they’ve never done in their life. No job is worth this, and I continue to witness people lose their way and virtues over this “climb to the top.” I’ve truly learned it’s a marathon and not a sprint witnessing other people try to sprint this. If a partner or senior manager stumbles across this post, check on your team. They’ll most likely lie to you, there’s a boatload going on that you won’t ever know about. \n\n3 - Just because you have a large meal budget doesn’t mean you need to use it all. I’ve probably put on 10 pounds from the travel lifestyle. Eat vegetables and fruit and only drink coffee/tea and water and you’ll feel 100% better when your senior has to reexplain the same thing to you because they’re so busy themselves they half assed it the first time. I’ve lost 5 doing this and got a little more efficient so it gets better with time I guess. \n\n4 - Marriott just gets traveling. The difference is material. Not a lot for this one but trust me, just stay at a Marriott brand if you have to travel and you’ll thank me when the tough times are a little easier. \n\n5 - if you don’t love accounting, this job will suck your soul dry. You’ll arrive at the client site so excited to start your real career. Shortly you’ll realize no one is excited to see you. The truth is no one likes being audited. No one at the client likes what you have to ask them to do. They’ll start resenting you after a couple of weeks and you’ll feel like a bad person when you have to ask them for more. I’ve struggled a lot with not feeling fulfilled and not feeling like I add any value to the business I’m auditing. Staring at Excel and a PDF editor for 15 hours a day 6 days a week takes a toll on your emotional and physical well-being. I wish I would have known it was going to be like this but I was so naive and bought into the Big4 or bust mentality at my university. Don’t fall into this trap. There are so many rewarding financial careers out there and unfortunately at this point I don’t see the value add or fulfillment in public accounting, I’m still here because I have loans and apparently this is how to “jumpstart a career” it’s a sacrifice you make to see the inner workings of how operationally excellent organizations run and how incompetent small private businesses can be. \n\n6 - keep your living space as clean and neat as possible. This is so important when you get home at 1 AM and everything with work is in shambles. You’ll be thankful to have your own space that’s in order and your personal hideaway from bullshit. I struggled with checking it at the door my first two weeks during busy season and it sucked. This comes with time but you’ll learn to do it eventually. It took me about 2 months if interim testing to figure this out. \n\nThis is all I have for tonight I have too much work to get done to type more. I hope this post can help someone like me a year ago. It’s going to be hard, keep a positive attitude and know when to say “this is enough”\n\nThe only reward I see in a big 4 career at this point is that you you learn about your limits, you’re forced to push past them, and then you learn to reject what the hive suees as “normal.” Knowing your limit in your early 20s is so rewarding in and of itself. Everything else they feed you about an audit career is mostly bullshit, the life lessons are more important than the walkthroughs and detail testing. \n\nGood luck, I hope I hit this close to spot on, looking forward to some discussion in the coming days. Anybody else in the same boat?",

Prepare to be humiliated.\n\n-Emails the Dean each and every time a student is absent. Even the Dean is sick of it.\n\n-Instead of passing around an attendance sheet like everyone else, he uses a seating chart to take attendance and routinely fucks it up. Random students will find themselves being yelled at for missing class when they were in fact present and all their classmates will vouch.\n\n-Distributes news articles at the beginning of class, starts lecturing without giving students time to read the handouts, then immediately starts cold-calling based on the handouts.\n\n-Lectures have absolutely nothing to do with the assigned reading. \n\n-At one point, declared he would not honor disability accommodations.

I’m looking into having the class mass-email the Dean with our own examples of Prof. Dickhead’s shittiness toward each of us. Here’s two of my personal examples: \n\n(1) My friend, A, missed class. Prof. Dickhead screwed up and marked me absent and A present. Next class, Prof Dickhead leans over my desk and gets right in my face, yelling that he’ll fail me if I miss one more class, pounding his fist on my desk like he’s fucking J. Jonah Jameson. \n\nA spoke up and told him that she was absent, not me. Prof. Dickhead then starts yelling at A instead, pointing his finger in her face and everything. (It was a little intimidating, as Prof Dickhead is quite a tall man and A and I are both petite.)\n\nAfter class, A reminds Prof Dickhead that A has an accommodation for a few extra absences (in compliance with ABA standards) regardless of the prof’s personal standards due to a long-term illness.\n\n Prof. Dickhead flips shit and tells A he won’t abide by that policy and A still has to be at every class for the rest of the semester or she fails.\n\n(2) It really shouldn’t even be necessary to have this as an accommodation at this level, but mine is that I must be permitted to take short breaks from class up to five minutes as needed. Of course, prof’s aren’t told the reason for the accommodation, just what the accommodation is.\n\nI left class for <3 minutes to go to the ladies’ room. It was that or piss myself. When I need the restroom, I need it RIGHT NOW. \n\nCame back to find Prof Dickhead in my chair. “Oh, sorry, I thought you decided not to attend the entire class and this seat was open.” \n\nAt this point, A and I called the disability director (dd). DD promptly sent out an email stating that all disability accommodations are to be honored by all professors and not called to others’ attention. Dd also had a meeting with Prof. Dickhead “to review ADA requirements.” \n\nJust got a wonderful email from the Dean because guess what? I followed my doctor’s advice to stay home and rest for a few days after hurting my neck in a car crash! \n\n/rant",

    "text": "Need big time help with character and fitness- felony I was innocent of My limited license application is due today and I need some serious help explaining an event \n\n5 years ago I was living with my boyfriend and police came in with a warrant. They tore our apartment  apartment. At the time I was 4 months pregnant and in my last semester of college. They suspected he had been trafficking narcotics. I was not named on the warrant at all, or even on their radar. \n\nAfter conducting a lengthy search, with about 10 officers (for a 500 sq ft apartment) and canines they found 2 “incriminating ” things: 1. A single pain pill 2. A small amount of white powder. \n\nI want to make clear that I had NO indication what so ever of any illegal activity going on on his end, or in our apartment. I do not and have never use drugs. I do not like drugs. I never saw him doing anything suspicious. I knew I was innocent and I had serious doubts about the accusations against him as well. There were no red flags suggesting he was involved in drug related activity.  However, I realize they had a valid watch warrant so I now question what he was doing outside of our apartment. \n\nThe police charged both of us with possession of narcotics and trafficking. They did not arrest me. My lawyer told me that they only charged me to ensure I would not try to say anything belonged to me- he was the target. \n\nI was not indicted on the trafficking charge, and I don’t think he was either (this was 5 years ago so it’s hard to remember ) After the grand jury proceeding it was revealed what I had known to be true  all along- that there were NO illegal drugs found in the apartment. The single pill found was for a valid and active prescription he had after suffering a serious injury at his job, which resulted in surgery (his hand was smashed between a printing press). The small amount of loose white powder came back also as NOT being a drug. I honestly think it was roach poison that the maintenance man put in our apartment (that’s embarrassing  but the truth.  we were extremely clean - I’m a neat freak- but our neighbors on the other side of the wall were filthy and eventually evicted for the condition of their apartment) the possession charge was eventually dismissed by motion of the prosecutor.   End of day, both of us were cleared of any drug involvement. \n\n(Him and I are no longer together although we have a beautiful child together! ) \n\nWith all of that being said, I’m not sure how to discuss this on character and fitness. I wrote an explanation when applying to law school, but everything I’ve read online  for character and fitness said take full responsibility and don’t make excuses. But the thing  is I TRULY did not do ANYTHING wrong here.  I honestly feel like the victim here. The police treated me horribly (I had had my blood drawn day before at doctor since I was pregnant and they insinuated I was shooting up drugs because I had a single needle mark in my arm! I don’t even smoke weed!!! They also used racial slurs and were extremely hateful when they didn’t find what they had anticipated.)  It is very hard for me to take responsibility for this incident because I was innocent of it. But I don’t want to fuck up my application. Any suggestions?",

    "text": "Mini rant: I am SO tired of men not taking care of themselves. I've complained about this before but it's blown up in my face again lately. \n\nThe last couple years has involved me seeing a lot of the middle aged and older men in my life and how they pretty much become incompetent and their own worst enemies when aging hits.\n\nMy father and uncles all have wives and daughters running behind them trying to get them to do the absolute *minimum* in acknowledging health issues and taking care of themselves. They're all completely capable, but years of marriage has honestly made them lazy. I have another close friend who just as she's getting to the point where her children are teens and starting to take care of themselves her husband's health issues are starting to emerge after years of ignoring signs of stress. I was talking to her earlier this week and it's already becoming obvious that she's having to make little changes to her life to accommodate his self neglect and it will probably just get worse because he's not making the changes he should be. Then I found out last week that a friend in his mid 30s has been walking around with blood pressure over 170 and is still making excuses about going to the doctor. \n\nI have cousins with similar issues and I'm just tired of watching women spend whole lives picking up after things that could *easily* be handled by men themselves, especially knowing that they're mostly likely going to die early and leave their wives and girlfriends in the care....of other women. I'm at a point where I seriously assume a man is an overgrown child unless proven otherwise and it's only getting worse as I get older and see how life and relationships *really* play out. Literally the only thing most of them are doing is keeping a career and owning some property. \n\nI'm seriously questioning my own sanity in even trying to be in a long term relationship because these are all the \"good men\".",

Trigger: When white people say you're limited in your career and relationship because you're black...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is soo triggering and offensive to me when people ESPECIALLY white people tell me, I am only going to get so far because I am black (or mixed with black.. I'm half black and half white).\n\nI remember working at this day care job where some racist white women were jealous this white man liked me. I remember I told one of the girls I was interested in bartending at this one bar and she told me, I shouldn't go there because they are racist. She was jealous that I could probably make a lot of money bartending so she used my race to basically put me in my place and to dissuade me from working there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI remember a tennis coach in high school told me  that sadly Obama was not going to make it as president because he was black but he was still going to vote for him though. Why the heck would you think it is okay to tell another black person that?? Not compassionate. How about saying, Obama will have to work harder because of the racism in this country, but with hard work he can reach his goals?!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen in college, a random stranger told me to forget about acting because it is hard industry and he said they may not want you at at times for different reasons like they may not want a black girl. Then he started hitting on me. What the heck?! Again, I know it is harder in the industry for minorities, but how inappropriate that he felt he could say this to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I was in elementary school, my white father told me to be careful of white guys because a lot of them wouldn't take me seriously and might only want to have sex with me. Very traumatizing, he definitely should not have told me that as a child. While there was some truth to what he said, I don't think it was in his place, as the white person, to tell me that. I know he was just trying to protect me but it was very traumatizing and unnecessary to tell me at such a young age. When people say these comments to me it feels like they are rubbing it in my face as well. Then, I want to become a nautropathic doctor and I told my dad, it will be harder for me because I am a black woman in field to get clients, and he nodded his head and tried to get me to change my career. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen if you look on the youtube comments on the Bachelor, you will see some comments about how they only are keeping the black girl on there so they do no appear racist. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Of course it is hurtful and hard to hear about some hardships I will have to go through because of racism. Now I am not saying all these white people's comments aren't valid to a certain extent. But it is angering when white people feel they have to teach me and tell me about the hardships I will have to go through as a mixed black woman when they haven't even had the black experience!! Also, it is wrong to tell a person to not try something because it will be harder for them to make it because they are not white. There would be no Obama, Halle Berry, or Oprah if they listened to these people who told them to stop trying because they won't make it because they are black. All these comments have definitely affected my self-esteem. I am definitely suspicious of white men who hit on me and be very anxious during job interviews and other aspects related to my career because I have in the mind being black will hinder me. I need to change my mindset to  an empowered one where I can view hardships of racism as a way I can become my better self and work harder and prove to myself and others I can do anything I can put my mind to!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUGH, OMG! Anyone else experience this?",

    "text": "A call for thoughts and prayers from my reddit sisters To cut to the chase: I'm running away from home in roughly two weeks. I'm not in any danger now nor have I been abused in the past. It's just time for me to leave, not just Mom's house but the city I live in now. I live in a rust belt city full of small town values and all the bigots that come with that. It's also been 5 months since I graduated from college and I have yet to find a job. At 36 being without income for 5 months is unacceptable and tbh both me and my mom have had enough of it. I say that I'm running away because I don't plan to tell my mom until after it happens. She thinks I'm merely going to New York Comic Con on a shoestring budget. Mom is very conservative in her willingness to take risks and she passed that on to me. I can recognize it and ignore it when I need to but she will never be able to understand my need to take a risk on myself, for myself. So I don't have any kind of support and no actual money. I been hustling and have a few things to sell but man is this emotionally draining. The worst part is that I know she'll be mad about it. She won't recognize the strength it takes to strike out on your own in a new city and will instead harp about how inconvenient it is to worry about me. Mom does love me but we have a difficult relationship due to my not being diagnosed with ADHD until I was 20 and her inability to understand that it really does affect every aspect of my life. I'm going to the doctor next week to get some meds for that, getting some new glasses probably(woo woo Medicaid!), and getting my annual Ob/Gyn visit out of the way. Part of me wants her to find out but that same part of me knows that she will just \"what if\" me into an early grave.\n\nMy plan is to couchsurf for a while and work InstaCart/quick gigs like focus groups while I job hunt. I started sending out resumes and cover letters this week and I hope to have some interviews scheduled next week. I have been thinking about this long enough to have a plan and some contingencies if the plans fall through. I've been homeless before and will undoubtedly survive it a second time. There's no real point in waiting for better times to come my way because the truth is that you often have to create your own favorable circumstances.\n\nAny advice, wisdom, etc would be amazing",

    "text": "A short appreciation of an ordinary television series My partner and I just watched the third episode of season one of [*Shadow*](https://www.netflix.com/nl-en/title/81033727), the first Netflix Original produced in and by South Africans.\n\nMy partner likes it a **lot** more than I do. Because my partner really likes stories with uncomplicated good guys and moustache-twirlingly villainous bad guys.^1\n\nBut I do like the show, for a, perhaps, unexpected reason.\n\nBecause, as a show, it’s a pretty ordinary example of its type.\n\nThe good guy is a stereotypical ‘down these mean streets a man must walk who is not, himself, mean or afraid’ good guy. His side-kick is a stereotypical ‘voice of the system/reluctant but always loyal’ helper.\n\nOur good guy’s sister (complete with wheelchair and back-story that makes her not-working legs both an accident and something our hero can feel responsible for) and the sister’s friend and flatmate (complete with an unhappy back-story and the requisite mix of serious aspirations to being a doctor and serious poverty forcing her into lap-dancing to make ends meet along the way) round out the troupe of stereotypes or archetypes.\n\nThe writing is competent but not great. The production values are first rate. And seeing an urban landscape that I don’t know (Johannesburg) is a fun mix of the familiar and unfamiliar.\n\nBut I like *Shadow* because this troupe of archetypes, and pretty much all the guest stars — all the noble victims and all the villainous bad guys — are black.\n\nAnd **none** of them are *being* black. They are just being. They are being poor. And rich. And (nobly) good. And (over the top) bad. And they are being news-readers, and doctors, and students, and medical researchers, and layout artists, and career-weary police chiefs. And even the occasional white character is just being. They aren’t performatively White the way so many black characters in US film and television are performatively Black.\n\nBack in August 2018, one of my favourite writers — N K Jemisin — wrote a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/nkjemisin/status/1024347776551936000) about what commercial entertainment is and is not made. Her core point was that we have not yet arrived. And we’ll know when we have. We’ll have arrived:\n\n> When you start seeing so many Native American fantasies that even\n> the so-so ones sell like gangbusters. Mediocre fantasies set in the\n> Malian Empire — more than one — on the NYT lists. Mediocre epics\n> from indigenous Australian traditions — more than one — getting HBO\n> series.\n\nOn its own, *Shadow* is not evidence enough that ‘We’ve Arrived’. But a perfectly competent but otherwise unremarkable genre TV show in which Black people are every unremarkable cliché such unremarkable genre TV shows are typically populated with is a start.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. In a previous career, my partner spent a long time working in the grey and complicated margins of society. They’ve had more than their fill of moral ambiguity and ethical quandaries in real life. They’ve come to very much prefer simpler and cleaner and brighter and sharper moral issues in their downtime entertainment.",

Much like the crack epidemic not given attention when it was a 'black problem', and need for 'intervention' to help opioid addicts who are now manly a white demographic, we have a similar analogy with Asian Americans.\n\nTo this very fucking day, Caucasian provosts (WASP/Jewish) routinely use non transparent admissions policies, while taking on huge grants and fellowships from taxpayer dollars (ie Pell) to deny  Asian Americans admissions into their universities. A lot of the focus has been on undergrad in these discrepencies, but its more pronounces in grad programs.

These all represent the number of false rape accusations made to the police that provably false using rigorous standards. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n And while it may be small, the 2-10% is actually 2-11%. They round that 2.3% number down to 2% so it's only fair to round the 10.9% up to 11%. You can either say 2.3%-10.9% or you can say 2-11%. It's a small thing but it irks me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut all of these numbers are minimums. Just like when 3-5% of cases end up with convictions. That means a minimum of 3-5% of rape cases taken to the police are true.

Oh it's from...\n\n National Institute of Justice & Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Prevalence, Incidence and Consequences of Violence Against Women Survey  \n\nThis is the precursor to the CDC NISVS survey. Guess what the CDC NISVS survey also found? It found that for years of 2010-2012 female-perpetrated \"made to penetrate\" sexual assault on men, (rape, for lack of a better word,) was at parity with male perpetrated rape for these years. Let that sink in for a minute.\n\nWhen you are done letting that sink in, ask yourself why a sub called r/menslib is not mentioning that in 2012 there were over 1.5 million instances of female-on-male rapes according to the CDC NISVS survey in 2012? (Although they don't call it that, but prefer the more awkward, \"made to penetrate\" sexual assault) '\n\nThis links to the CDC NISVS survey data so you can check for yourself. The lifetime stats are much lower than the year over year and despite my inquiries to the CDC I have not gotten an answer as for why that is. However, for each year of 2010, 2011, and 2012 we find parity between the sexes for sexual assault/rape perpetration. Look at the 12 month data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis blog does a very good job of breaking this down:\n\n [https://recalculatingthegenderwar.tumblr.com/post/162336650896/new-cdc-data-again-finds-as-many-if-not-more](https://recalculatingthegenderwar.tumblr.com/post/162336650896/new-cdc-data-again-finds-as-many-if-not-more) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Only a 1/3rd of sexual assaults are reported to police.

The majority of false rape accusations are made against non existent strangers the victims claim they don't know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a nice rabbit pulled out of the hat. Why are we assuming that all of the sexual assaults not reported to the police are true? I for one have been the collateral damage victim of a false/baseless rape accusation made on social media. Ostensibly, rape accusations that are not taken to the police and are merely posted on Twitter, Facebook, or added a circulating anonymous rapist list, or made at a bar, or something... are MORE likely to be false. Not less. Yet this author would have you believe that they are all 100% true. Magic! \n\nOf course there are many rapes that happen that are never taken to the police. For example, the 1,5 million incidents of female on male \"made to penetrate\" rape that I mentioned above. Almost none of these are reported. Less than 1 percent. These male victims of female perpetrators are hidden by systemic cultural bias.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Soo how many false rape allegations lead to false arrests and convictions then?  \n>  \n>How many people Falsely Accused of Rape actually go to Jail?  \n>  \n>Thankfully we found that the answer is very low.  \n>  \n>[National Registry of Exoneration who keeps track of how many innocent people have been... well... exonerated found that since 1989 in the US ~~52~~ people have been exonerated for sexual assault that they didn't do.

Of that number, what percentage yielded results that excluded defendants as sources of the DNA evidence or were inconclusive?*\n\n  *The 40 surveyed laboratories yielded 19 whose available data were sufficient for the purposes of this study. The 19 included 13 at the State/local level, 4 in the private sector, an armed forces laboratory, and the FBI's laboratory.*  \n\n*Most of the laboratories had initiated DNA testing only within the previous few years. Twelve began testing between 1990 and 1992. Three of the four private laboratories began in 1986 or 1987, while the FBI started DNA testing in 1988.*  \n\n*Seven of the laboratories reported using RFLP testing; four, PCR testing; and eight, both types of tests.  The 19 laboratories reported that, since they began testing, they had received evidence in 21,621 cases for DNA analysis, with the FBI accounting for 10,060 cases. Three of the 4 private laboratories averaged 2,400 each; the State and local laboratories averaged 331 each.* \n\n ***In about 23 percent of the 21,621 cases, DNA test results excluded suspects, according to respondents****. An additional 16 percent of the cases, approximately, yielded inconclusive results, often because the test samples had deteriorated or were too small. Inconclusive results aside, test results in the balance of the cases did not exclude the suspect.*  \n\n***The FBI reported that, in the 10,060 cases it received, DNA testing results were about 20 percent inconclusive and 20 percent exclusion; the other 18 laboratories (11,561 cases) reported about 13 percent and 26 percent, respectively.\\**** \n\n *Unfortunately, the laboratories were unable to provide more details. They did not maintain data bases that would permit categorization of DNA test results by type of offense and other criteria. What happened to the suspects who were excluded through DNA testing also cannot be determined. Were they released, or were they charged on the basis of other evidence, for example?  Thus, only the most general information is known about the results of DNA testing by laboratories. To  obtain more detailed information would require a comprehensive research project.*   \n \n\nThat's hard forensic data that puts the ballpark figure of false rape accusation at about 1 in 4. Now to be fair, some of these may have been genuine mistaken identity. But if you are the man under arrest by the police accused of rape, you would call that a false rape accusation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Fact is that the majority of false rape accusations don't even name a suspect. And throwing this into the picture of the total of the numbers of rape really proves how rare false rape **Convictions** are. Vast majority of false rape accusers always accuse a non existent stranger who raped them and usually not someone specifically. Which means that beyond wasting time and resources majority of false rape accusations are harmless to the general public because no one person is accused.  \n>  \n>When you take these studies and add them to what we already know about rape a more complete picture forms:  \n>  \n>1/6 women claim to have experience sexual assault, follow by a 1/3 reporting the assault to police, then **worst case scenario** 1/10 are false. Out of those false rape accusations 9/50 name a suspect, out of false rape accusations that accuse someone 15/100 get an arrest and, out of those who are arrested for a rape they didn't do only 1/3 have charges placed against them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**This is so wrong as to be a lie. Remember, according to Dr. Lisak's metastudy, a minimum of 2-11 percent of all rape accusations taken to the police are PROVEN to be false.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So 1/6 x 1/3 x 1/10 x 9/50 x 15/100 x 1/3 = 0.00005  \n>  \n>Which mean out of all the women you meet you have a **0.005% chance of being falsely charged of Rape.**\n\n**A blood vessel in my frontal lobe just exploded.

Add this to the fact that [most legitimate victims lie to themselves and others saying that they weren't sexually assaulted when they really were.

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313830325\\_Motives\\_for\\_Filing\\_a\\_False\\_Allegation\\_of\\_Rape](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313830325_Motives_for_Filing_a_False_Allegation_of_Rape) \n\nReasons for a false rape accusation:\n\n* Material gain: to receive money, [professional promotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(rank)) or other material benefits.\n* Producing an [alibi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibi): a false allegation is used to cover up other behaviour, such as being late or absent to an appointment.\n* Revenge: to retaliate against a disliked person by damaging the reputation, freedom or finances.\n* Attention: an attempt to receive any kind of attention, positive or negative, by anyone.\n* Sympathy: a special kind of attention-seeking whereby the complainant tries to improve a personal relationship with a specific individual.\n* 'A disturbed mental state'; this may include false memories (\"sexual hallucinations\") or pathologic lying.\n* Relabeling: consensual sex is relabeled 'rape' to the police, because of its 'disappointing or shameful character'. De Zutter et al. argue that a distinction should be made between some acts during a consensual sexual encounter that a participant did not want or had no desire to engage in but nonetheless gave consent to (e.g. to please their partner) on the one hand, and rape (nonconsensual sex) on the other, but that many lay people and even some scholars do not make this distinction and confuse the two. It is often when accounts of such 'unwanted consensual sex' are told to friends and family that the latter interpret it as rape, and put the complainant under pressure to file an allegation.\n* Regret: after having had consensual sex, a complainant experiences negative feelings such as disgust, shame, and sorrow; when others notice this and ask about the source of these negative feelings, they are prone to view the encounter as rape and put the complainant under pressure to file an allegation.\n\n### 'Don't know'\n\nAccording to De Zutter et al. (2017), 20% of complainants said that they did not know why they had filed a false allegation.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape#cite_note-Zutter2017-8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n While we are at it, wikipedia also lists false memories as a reason for a false rape accusation. \n\n### False memories[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=False_accusation_of_rape&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nThere are several ways in which an alleged victim can accidentally come to believe that they have been raped by the person(s) they accuse. These include, but are not limited to:[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape#cite_note-French-7)\n\n* [Recovered memory therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovered_memory_therapy): memories of sexual abuse 'recovered' during therapy in the absence of any supporting evidence, based on the [Freudian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud) notion of \"[repression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repression_(psychology))\"[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape#cite_note-French-7)\n* The victim's confusion of the memory of the real rapist with the memory of someone else\n* [Memory conformity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_conformity): memory can become contaminated when co-witnesses discuss their recall of events\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's not forget that in the UK, \"alleged\" rape victims are paid in cash regardless of whether the accused is found guilty or not.  \n\nJemma Beale collected 11,000 pounds before being caught. That's a hell of a side gig.  falsely accused nine men of raping her on separate occasions, while a further six had supposedly sexually assaulted her.  \n\n[https://thewarrzone.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-hard-lessons-of-jemma-beale.html](https://thewarrzone.blogspot.com/2019/03/the-hard-lessons-of-jemma-beale.html) \n\nShe is unique in that she is one of the rare false rape accusers to be prosecuted. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Why didn't you include those other \"Studies\"?  \n>  \n>Since I am from the future I know this will be bring up sooo I will nip it in the butt before it shows up in the comments. And if they still show up without talking about this section of my effort post you have my permission to shame them.\n\nSmall thing, but the saying is \"nip in the bud.\" Like a plant. Shame is how feminism works, right? They shame people into submission. Like #metoo. If you stand up to a false rape accusation they shame you as a RAPE APOLOGIST. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>People who fear the False Accusation \"Epidemic\" that is supposedly happening like to point to the \"other studies\" on these issues. What are these other \"studies\" and why don't I use them in my analysts? Well because they are bad. Flat out bad or rely on a misconception of the nature of sexual assault. And there are alot of them. Lets take sample out of the list Wikipedia provided.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>[Also these studies expose a much larger issue when it comes to research into sexual assault.... What is Sexual Assault and what is False Sexual Assault. When you look at studies the older ones tend to have uhhhhhh questionable views of what is and isn't sexual assault.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/CA29549D811B7C639DFF2754197BBF9C/S0008197306007069a.pdf/false_allegations_of_rape.pdf)\n\nI would say the same argument could be flipped on the new definitions of rape coming our of Academic feminism. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Then if you look at other higher studies like Kanin and Jordan you figure out that they are working on the police definitions of False or Not. Unfortunately that means that they consider a story false if the victim:  \n>  \n>Failed a Polygraph [Click here if you wanna know why the Polygraph is \\^\\^\\^bullshit](https://www.vox.com/2015/10/18/9560391/polygraphs-wrong-police)  \n>  \n>If the victim delayed reporting their rape  \n>  \n>If the victim was [\"Intellectually Impaired\"](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/08/570224090/the-sexual-assault-epidemic-no-one-talks-about)  \n>  \n>If the victim has signs of mental illness  \n>  \n>If the victim was intoxicated  \n>  \n>If the victim withdraw the complaint  \n>  \n>And if the victim was determined by police to be a \"Slut\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are criticism to make of Kanin. Small sample size, sure. Undisclosed location, also iffy. But according to Kanin, the police only classified an accusation as false if the alleged victim confessed to it being false AND they were able to corroborate the new story with the defendant and other witnesses. It did involve a serious, but not mandatory, offer of a polygraph test. But the offer of the polygraph test was merely a catalyst. An accusation was on classified as false if the alleged victim herself recanted. In 41% of the cases, the alleged victim did so. \n\nThere are legitimate concerns about this study I listed above. But the author has told another lie. No accusation was regarded as false at any time because of a failed polygraph or for any of the above listed reasons. I'll have to read the Jordan study because the author definitely lied about Kanin so I can assume he probably lied about Jordan as well. In fact, I completely distrust this guy.\n\n [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01541619](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01541619) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>While false complaints do occur, approximately **three-quarters of the incidents concluded by the police to be false appeared to have been judged to some extent at least on the basis of stereotypes regarding the complainant’s behavior, attitude, demeanor or possible motive.** Suspicious file comments were made by the detectives regarding a woman who laughed while being interviewed, others who were seen as ‘attention seeking,’ and some who were said to be ‘crying rape’ for revenge or guilt motives.\n\n**Attention seeking, Revenge, and guilt** are all common and legitimate motivation for a false rape accusation according to self confessed accounts accumulated by De Zutter 2017. See above. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That's right. 75% of False Rape Accusations labeled as such by police were not because they were proven false but on the gut feelings of the police. Which means we get plenty of **false false rape accusations**. This is probably a bigger issue then men being falsely accused of Rape. [There have been plenty of documented cases of police pressuring victims to sign false confessions claiming they made up their sexual assaults.](https://www.propublica.org/article/false-rape-accusations-an-unbelievable-story) Its why one of the major reasons why [out of 1000 rapes only 6 rapists will go to jail while for robberies 20 will go to jail and 33 of assault and battery](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system).  \n>  \n>Using Fear as a WeaponWhy do we talk about False Rape Allegations all the time, and how its used as a political weapon.\n\nThe police deal with the shittiest people of society all day every day. You are allowed to be skeptical of the police. You are not allowed to completely write them off. I call bullshit. It might not be as high as 75% but it's high. In the UK false rape accusations are so common that police now demand that \"alleged\" victims hand over their phones when making an accusation that can check to see if they texted the accused the following morning something like, \"Thank you for the great sex last night.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Though most rational people don't see this as such a major issues within far conservatism and the Manosphere you tend to see false accusations be pushed as the major issue against men. In fact I decided to do my own study where I went to [r/MenRights](https://www.reddit.com/r/MenRights/) typed it \"Rape\" and look at the 102 top posts by [r/menrights](https://www.reddit.com/r/menrights/) on the subject. I only accepted posts of two categories, male victims of sexual assault and stories on false rape accusations. As expected [r/MenRights](https://www.reddit.com/r/MenRights/) had more posts about false rape then male victims of rape.\n\nStop kidding yourself. False rape accusations are a HUGE concern for men. Innocence is no defense against a rape accusation. Your life, your reputation, your friends, you family, your career, your honor, your legacy are all permanently and irrevocably damaged by a false rape accusation. It's shameful. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>As you can see despite the fact that men are [1 in 33 in odds of being raped, that 1 in 10 rape victims are male](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence), and as stated before only 0.005% of rape accusations lead to a man being arrested as stated above. MRAs post more about and care more about false rape accusations then male victims of sexual assault. Why is that? Why do we even talk about false rape so much if its more rare than males being raped? I get a suspicion that plenty who champion this cause are arguing disingenuously.\n\nInteresting that he mentions a man being arrested but how come so few women are arrest for rape even though there are multiple studies going back to the 1980s indicating it's massively underreported. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFalse Rape accusations are not RARE. They are AT LEAST 2-11 percent of all rape accusations taken to the police. I'd bet that number is much higher since the #metoo movement when every single sociopathic liar KNOWS that they will be #believed. Oftentimes in spite of evidence. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFalse Accusations are rampant enough that only segregation can solve it\n\n>Yeaaaa... This covers harassment as well. Plenty of people have been using the fear of false rape accusations against men as proof that women should be \"isolated\". [They also openly brag to each other that they \"won't hire more qualified women because I am too scared of a lawsuit\"](https://youtu.be/dHiAls8loz4?t=87). As stated before the case of someone falsely accusing someone else in the workplace environment is ultra rare as most false rapes come from children or the homeless, and the vast majority don't name suspects. If anything men should be worried about sexual harassment from coworkers as it is way [more statistically likely that men will be a victim of sexual harassment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/men-account-for-nearly-1-in-5-complaints-of-workplace-sexual-harassment-with-the-eeoc/2018/04/08/4f7a2572-3372-11e8-94fa-32d48460b955_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.06fb338bce7a) then falsely accuse of harassment themselves.\n\nChoose one.\n\nAdopt a #Believewomen policy and eliminated due process for men in the workplace. \n\nOr demand that women be hired at equal rates as men. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>False Rape Accusers should get same length sentence as Rapists  \n>  \n>This is a common cry for those within the MRA movement is that these false accusers are getting off to easy.

If MRAs called for this guideline I can't help to feel they would be even more disappointed in the sentencing expecting 20 years but IRL only getting a few months. If we treated false rape accusers the same as rapists then we as a society wouldn't take them that seriously.\n\nFor both men and for women. Countless women who have sexually assaulted and gotten away with it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Also I want to quickly address the other MRAs call for those who have been falsely accused to be placed on the Sex Offender Registry Lists. Uuuuuuuhhh What?!? This is improper use of such a list number 1, and 2 that publicly available list would then create a public list of people you can rape without repercussions. Think about it. If you publicly branded people as \"False Rape Accuser\" then which people would rapists target?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm actually opposed to the Sex Offender Registry Lists as they currently stand in our country. Female Pedophiles are very often offered a plea deal to stay off the registry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Putting extra laws and punishments on this mush smaller issue of False Rape Accusations put more pressure on legitimate victims of sexual assault. Under the existing law there are cases of legit victims being classified by police as false victims. If you add additional punishment then we will punish legitimate victims of rape 20 years in prison for just reporting their rape and police not believing in them. And that will have a chilling effect on the rest of victims of sexual assault out there. Its hard enough as is, but if you are unable to prove it and you \"act like a slut\" then you could face jail time\n\nThis is just as true for rape victims. The UK is seeing an influx of innocent men convicted of rape because of horrible #believewomen policies. It is an actual nightmare. \n\nI think false rape accusations need to be rigorously prosecuted when there is substantial evidence of malicious intent. Just because the defendant is not convicted doesn't mean it was a false rape accusation. But in many cases, there is evidence of clear malicious intent, yet the false accuser is not punished, \"lest we discourage others from coming forward.\" (Other false accusers?)\n\n [https://metro.co.uk/2017/09/27/man-cleared-of-rape-after-victim-said-ill-ring-police-tomorrow-its-going-to-be-fun-6958964/amp/?ito=article.amp.share.top.twitter&\\_\\_twitter\\_impression=true](https://metro.co.uk/2017/09/27/man-cleared-of-rape-after-victim-said-ill-ring-police-tomorrow-its-going-to-be-fun-6958964/amp/?ito=article.amp.share.top.twitter&__twitter_impression=true) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso check out r/falserapeaccusations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Conclusion\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That's why [r/MenRights](https://www.reddit.com/r/MenRights/) and Reddit as a whole under reports on male victims of rape.

The good news is that according to the BOJ, rape, along with other violent crimes has been dropping steadily since the 1960s. In 2012 the number pivoted because for the first time in USA history, the FBI legally acknowledged that men can be raped. Unfortunately it has been worded such that female on male \"made to penetrate\" sexual assault is still not rape. Women can only rape men if they anally penetrate them. We still have a long way to go for true gender equality. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo remember this TL;DR when you think about False Rape Accusations.\n\n>TL;DR  \n>  \n>For both genders you are way more likely to be raped then falsely accused of rape.\n\nNobody actually knows how likely you are to be falsely accused of rape. At a minimum, 2-11 percent of rape accusations made to the police are false. Probably the number is closer to 1 in 4 due to hard forensic evidence of backtested rapekits that excluded the primary suspect, (as fingered by the alleged victim,) 23% of the time. But we don't really know. It's probably safe to say that you are more at risk of being false accused of rape in 2019 than at any other time in human history because of the public demonstrations of #believewomen. Many still believe Ford's accusations against Kavanugh despite being thoroughly discredited by Leland Keyser. [https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/just-didnt-make-any-sense-leland-keyser-now-challenges-story-of-kavanaugh-accuser-christine-blasey-ford](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/just-didnt-make-any-sense-leland-keyser-now-challenges-story-of-kavanaugh-accuser-christine-blasey-ford) \n\n\" **I don’t have any confidence in the story,” Keyser told** ***New York Times*** **reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly**  \n\n **\"Those facts together I don't recollect, and it just didn't make any sense,\" Keyser told the authors.** \n\n **\"It would be impossible for me to be the only girl at a get-together with three guys, have her leave, and then not figure out how she's getting home,\" Keyser told Pogrebin and Kelly. \"I just really didn't have confidence in the story.\"** \n\n **A few days** [**before the hearing**](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/22/politics/kavanaugh-ford-accuser-nomination/index.html)**, Keyser’s attorney said, “Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.”**\n\n**\"Keyser later said she felt pressure by both \\[Ford classmate Lucy\\] Gonella and Ford's friend Monica McLean to change her story,\" Pogrebin and Kelly wrote.**\n\n**\"I was told behind the scenes that certain things could spread about me if I didn't comply,\" Keyser told the authors.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#metoo has already been politically weaponized. This is ridiculous. WE are being gaslighted. This is bullshit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The estimated number of false rape accusations are around 2-10% at the highest.\n\nThis is a lie on several levels. It's 2-11%. And that is a minimum. And that's if you only consider surveys conducted by feminists or women's advocates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>For 216 False Rape Accusations only 39 named suspects, and only 2 got charged. That means that only 18% of False Rape Accusations actually accuse someone and that only 0.9% of false rape accusations ended up on court.\n\nI'm pretty sure this stat is referring to how many false rape accusers got charged. So now you are just making up numbers. You are either lying or grossly mistaken. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Vast majority of false rape accusations are made by Teenagers, Parents of Children, and the Homeless.\n\nThere's no way to know this. And there is also no citation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>55% of False Rape Accusations are in hopes of getting free medical treatment. Next major category is from teenagers justifying their absences to parents.\n\nDid I miss the source for this. Why are you ignoring De Zutter (2017)?\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr #metoo is a puritanical, sexist witchhunt that strips men of due process while refusing to hold women to the same standards, as per Asia Argento, Katy Perry, and Amber Heard. It's is a moral panic. Much like McCarthyism we will look back on #metoo with a deep sense of shame for vigilante mob justice conducted in the name of false rape accsusations.",

    "text": "People constantly overstate the extent to which women were \"oppressed\" in the past. People constantly quote that \"women didn't have the right to own property\", \"women were chattel\", \"women were allowed to be abused, beaten and raped by men\", \"women didn't have the right to vote\", \"women were kept out of male-dominated industries\", \"women were oppressed by men\", etc.\n\nAll this is bullshit.\n\nUnder coverture, single women otherwise known as \"femme sole\" did have the right to own property, had the right to enter into contracts, and overall had the same rights as single men. It was only when they married that they sacrificed some of their rights to own property and enter into contracts on their own.\n\nWhen a woman got married she was considered a \"femme covert\" and her existence was consolidated into that of the man's. People constantly take this to mean that she was chattel, owned by men but this was not the case. Once they were married, women were entitled to be supported and to have the portion that she brought into the marriage managed by their husbands, to the best of their ability. Women had the right to buy necessaries on their husband's credit as their husband's agent. Women could not be prosecuted for most crimes and their husbands would be prosecuted in their stead. Women were immune from liability for debt. They were not in any way chattel, they definitely had less agency, but at the same time they were entitled to protections and privileges and it was considered the man's duty to provide said protections and privileges for them. Women have very frequently sought redress in common law and equity courts when husbands failed in their duties.\n\nMarried women were also not allowed to be abused unlike what people think. The laws allowed for mild correction such as spanking the way you would a child at the time but husbands were not allowed to beat their wives black and blue. A woman could obtain a surety of the peace bond to ensure her safety from a violent husband.\n\n[https://lonang.com/library/reference/blackstone-commentaries-law-england/bla-115/](https://lonang.com/library/reference/blackstone-commentaries-law-england/bla-115/)\n\n[https://www.legalgenealogist.com/2019/02/12/the-defense-of-coverture/](https://www.legalgenealogist.com/2019/02/12/the-defense-of-coverture/)\n\n[https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download\\_file?file\\_format=application/pdf&safe\\_filename=Item.pdf&type\\_of\\_work=Journal%20article](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download_file?file_format=application/pdf&safe_filename=Item.pdf&type_of_work=Journal%20article)\n\nYes, women didn't have the right to vote for most of history, but neither did men. Property owners had the vote, the vast majority of men did not. Male suffrage was something that was fought for, and when men did end up getting the vote before women it wasn't necessarily because of discrimination against women. It was because the vote at the time was seen as a direct extension of men's obligation to be conscripted and fight in war, something which women were not obligated to do.\n\nSomething that makes this even more muddy than it already is is that: the reason why votes for women took so long to be implemented was that the majority of women did not want the vote. There were many anti-suffragette societies, and a fair amount of them were led by women.\n\n[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1910/jul/11/parliamentary-franchise-women-bill](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1910/jul/11/parliamentary-franchise-women-bill)\n\n[https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-history-dept/2015/10/22/450221328/american-women-who-were-anti-suffragettes](https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-history-dept/2015/10/22/450221328/american-women-who-were-anti-suffragettes)\n\n[http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/gilded/power/text12/antisuffrageassoc.pdf](http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/gilded/power/text12/antisuffrageassoc.pdf)\n\nWomen were allowed to work in a lot of male-dominated industries. Guild-type work was always open to single women and windows. In fact there is a lack of evidence of anything preventing women from working. An article (which I've linked below) says:\n\n\"For most girls, becoming a blacksmith was probably not a dream. Husband, family, home: those were the pursuits of a young woman of the eighteenth century. Finding a woman or women working at all outside the home, much less in a male-dominated trade, most likely meant the dream wasn't shaping up the way they'd hoped. Some women worked because they had no choice.\"\n\n\"Though there was no system of standards governing the trades in the colonies, the method of learning a trade generally followed the apprenticeship guidelines established by the guilds in medieval England and Europe. Women were not excluded from membership in any of the earlier guilds. The Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths in London lists sixty-five \"brethren\" and two \"sistren\" in its 1434 charter.\"\n\nThe paragraph below is a quote from a redditor \"w1g2\" who made a really good point regarding work, and women's involvement in it.\n\nWas it a social norm that most women did not seek out careers as they do now? Sure, I don't doubt it. But women did not have access to reliable birth control (because it hadn't been invented) so unless they wanted to spend the entirety of their life chaste, would have to plan for many of their years being filled with pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, etc. Not to mention, quite a lot of the jobs available weren't in nice air- conditioned offices but involved hard labor or danger like becoming a doctor (working with the near dead, sometimes even people with a plague) or a lawyer (working with criminals, especially when prisons did not have as nice standards for living). Maybe it's the case that in different environments, people, including women, will have to react accordingly to different things and maybe it's understandable that in an environment that used to have far more risk and danger and death and with little knowledge or control over fertility, women wanted different things than they do now.\n\n[https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring04/women.cfm](https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring04/women.cfm)\n\nSo. Women were not nearly as \"oppressed\" as people seem to think they were. There was never a patriarchy holding women down. Were there burdens, obligations and disadvantages? At times, yes. But these usually did not run one way - men too had their own set of burdens. And whenever I mention this to people it's met with handwaving or sometimes outright denial of the evidence.\n\nIt seems to be very hard for a lot of people I've seen to believe that women had a lot more privilege and social power than previously believed, and that men had obligations imposed on them.",

    "text": "A lot of the problems we see with \"nice guys\" and incels today are a direct result of shaming male sexual desire. (Removed from Oney for not being critical of incels) As one of my favorite bits of text explaining the \"nice guy\" issue states.\n\n\n>Yeah, I think one of the really pervasive messages that you get in modern society is that women don't want men to bother them. Obviously they don't intend to be universal--there are times and places and situations where they want attention from men. And yes, a lot of the time, the problem is that they don't want attention from men they don't respect.\n\n>And I guess for some men, they have experiences that tell them that sometimes women do want to be approached, and sometimes women do want to be complimented on their physical beauty, and sometimes women do want to be seen as sexy and invited to have sex. Maybe they had experiences when they were teenagers where horny girls just took over. Maybe they just didn't feel that the messages applied to them. Maybe they don't give a shit and are just willing to take any amount of being called a creep if sometimes it works.\n\n>But that's the problem, right? You and I care. We want to be good people who respect women. We want women to like us and respect us. We want to be the good guys who don't objectify them, and who always treat them like fellow humans instead of pieces of meat. So we hear that women don't like being objectified, and we feel uncomfortable saying anything that suggests we noticed their looks. They say they want to be treated as equals, and we feel like we should avoid anything that feels chivalrous. We hear that they feel uncomfortable being hit on in a certain situation, and we worry about hitting on them in any situation. We don't want to be the guy she rants about tomorrow. We want to be the guy women trust and feel safe around.\n\n>But that's not what women want in a partner. As much as they protest guys treating them like meat, they want their boyfriends to need them right now. As much as they say they don't want to be objectified, they want their lovers to think they're sexy as fuck. And as much as they say they are uncomfortable being hit on, they love it when a guy is forward and confident about hitting on them.\n\n>But see, we don't get those messages. Really, the whole idea of women having sexual desire still remains pretty taboo. So we just get the rants.\n\nThen there's this somewhat infamous article. (at least it's been treated as such when I've posted it elsewhere.)\n\nhttp://lukemuehlhauser.com/the-plight-of-shy-male-nerds-in-a-feminist-world/\n\nWhich if you don't feel like reading. I'll include the two bits that I found most important. \n\n> Here’s the thing: I spent my formative years — basically, from the age of 12 until my mid-20s — feeling not “entitled,” not “privileged,” but terrified. I was terrified that one of my female classmates would somehow find out that I sexually desired her, and that the instant she did, I would be scorned, laughed at, called a creep and a weirdo, maybe even expelled from school or sent to prison.You can call that my personal psychological problem if you want, but it was strongly reinforced by everything I picked up from my environment: to take one example, the sexual-assault prevention workshops we had to attend regularly as undergrads, with their endless lists of all the forms of human interaction that “might be” sexual harassment or assault, and their refusal, ever, to specify anything that definitely wouldn’t be sexual harassment or assault. I left each of those workshops with enough fresh paranoia and self-hatred to last me through another year.\n\n\nAND\n\n>Of course, I was smart enough to realize that maybe this was silly, maybe I was overanalyzing things. So I scoured the feminist literature for any statement to the effect that my fears were as silly as I hoped they were. But I didn’t find any. On the contrary: I found reams of text about how even the most ordinary male/female interactions are filled with “microaggressions,” and how even the most “enlightened” males — especially the most “enlightened” males, in fact — are filled with hidden entitlement and privilege and a propensity to sexual violence that could burst forth at any moment.\n\n\nAnd he'll for the sake of balance here's an article from a female and more feminist perspective on the matter. \n\nhttps://polyamorydiaries.com/stop-shaming-men-for-having-a-sex-drive/\n\nWhich has this great quote on the topic. \n\n>Sex-positive, feminist blogger Emma Lindsay explains it best:\n\n>When we shame someone like Ken Bone for, essentially, getting turned on by women we are perpetuating rape culture. When we call men “creeps” for having extremely normal biological desires, we emotionally stunt them, so they are unable to negotiate for said desires in good faith. If men weren’t ashamed to be seen in their desire, they wouldn’t mind having sex with women with brains and emotions. They wouldn’t be so fascinated by the promise of sex objects unable to judge them. They wouldn’t hate themselves, and by extension women, for making them hate themselves.\n\n(I didn't link the article that was taken from because I felt it was a bit too off topic)\n\nBasically. I feel like this shame many men are being fed towards their own sexual desires is one of the main contributors to their inability to \"ask\" for what they want. \n\nAnd I think the current discourse doesn't help either. \n\nEvery time I see the word \"entitled\" levied against a lonely man, be they an incel or a \"nice guy\" \n\nI can't help but think \"why is it so wrong that this person wants to have sex?\" \n\nThey're not wrong or bad for wanting this. They're not entitled. The term is so overused that it's lost it's original meaning.\n\nThey just want the same thing as nearly everybody else. To have a few orgasms, and to touch/hold another human being in an intimate fashion. \n\nYet we approach these people as if they're monsters for being frustrated at not being able to fulfill the exact same desires we all have. \n\nand what's worse. IMHO is all the people that try to say that \"this is just the way it is, and there's nothing wrong with living a life of abstinence and sexual frustration\"\n\nTreating sex and love like it's a drug addiction they need to break. while hypocritically partaking in it themselves. \n\nCan you imagine if went to a rehab center only to find out that all of the doctors and workers there openly did all of the drugs you were being told to stay away from? \n\nNow this is not to say that I think women should be “blamed” for men not having sex, nor do I think anyone owes sex to anyone else. \n\nBut. if it weren't so easy for men to be inherently labelled predatory for their perfectly natural desires, and there weren't such grievous consequences for being tagged as a \"creep\" Maybe a lot of these unfortunate trends would start solving themselves.",

    "text": "An Excerpt from 'Confessions of a Male Nurse' demonstrating male disposabilty and sexism in the work place. In 'Confessions of a Male Nurse' Michael Alexander shares his experiences as a male nurse. This passage is about the sexism he faced.\n\n*Four Police officers have just brought an aggressive psychiatric patient(Mr. Brown) to the clinic...*\n\n...\n\n‘Watch him, boys,’ the officer in charge warned. \n\n‘He’s just waiting for his hands to be free.’ He was brought down to the ground, face first. In this position he wouldn’t be able to use his arms to hit us as the handcuffs were removed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was nothing more we could do until the psychiatrist arrived, which we had been told would be in about 15 minutes. It was time to leave. I instructed the officers holding the legs to go first, then next the officers holding the hands, followed very quickly by me. The secret to a safe exit is simple: move as fast as you bloody well can, slam the door and lock the bolts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs the bolts were thrown home, Mr Brown charged for the door pounding on it with fists and feet for several minutes, before giving up and sitting back down on the mattress, staring at the door. \n\n**‘I think he needs a male to look after him,’ said the charge nurse, kindly volunteering my services.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe police left and I was given the job of sitting outside the seclusion room door and peering in through the tiny reinforced window every five minutes. An urgent call had gone out for the psychiatrist to come as soon as possible. Mr Brown needed some serious sedation; his mind and body needed to rest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we waited, Mr Brown came to stand by the door, inches from where I sat, and tried to plead with me to let him go.\n\n‘I’ll be good now. You can trust me. I’ll do as you say. You can even open the door and I’ll just sit here. Just open the door, that’s all.’\n\nI ignored him. It wasn’t long before he changed tactics.\n\n‘Let me out, or I’ll fucking kill you. You’ll be the first. I’ll make it hurt. Let me out now and you’ll live. Do you want to die? You’re gonna die, with my hands around your throat.’\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe began to kick the door, the old wood taking a hell of a battering. I checked all three locks, to make sure they were all bolted securely. I endured several minutes of some very graphic abuse, before he tried the pleading tactic again. In total I suffered 20 minutes of this barrage of begging and threatening, before the psychiatrist arrived.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDr King took one look in through the window and ordered a very strong dose of tranquilliser.\n\n‘He does appear to be in a very bad way, wouldn’t you say?’ he asked casually. I wasn’t sure if he expected an answer or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‘You sort out Mr Brown and I’ll draw up the injection,’ Dr King ordered. He didn’t appear to be the least bit worried by the situation. Of course, at the age of 59, he would have no hand in the upcoming restraint.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nT*he problem now was how to get in there and administer the injection. Since the police had left, I had to ask the staff to assist me and I was sure that help would not be forthcoming. For a start, I was the only male on that shift and, second, the average age of the women was at least 40.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**‘Um, I’ve got a bad back; hurt it during my last restraint,’ said Jane, the only nurse my age.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***The other women didn’t even bother with an excuse; they said flat out that they did not have a death wish. I had no option but to call in the police.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore long, the same four officers who had brought Mr Brown in were beside me, peering at the patient who had by now realised we were coming. If there had ever been any notion that Mr Brown was going to make things easy for us, and that he might have calmed down a bit, his shadow boxing performance soon put an end to it. It seemed as if madness had lent strength to Mr Brown.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI motioned for the officers to lead the way.\n\nThe officer in charge, Sergeant Perkins, looked at me and said, ‘He’s your bloody patient; you go first.’ It had been worth a try.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a strategy we use when taking down a violent patient, it involves each person being designated a specific body part, that is, right arm, left arm, right leg, left leg or head. If you are responsible for a body part then that is all you aim for. This strategy requires feeling confident that your partners do their job and concentrate on their body parts. If I was to grab Mr Brown’s right arm but my partner was to fail to take the left arm I would end up with a very swift hook to the side of the head. It’s all about trust.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt’s also about speed; we needed to try to overwhelm Mr Brown with speed and organisation. The door was opened quickly (which was actually rather hard since it had three locks) and I led the charge, my head down and my eyes glued to Mr Brown’s right arm. I caught a couple of glancing blows to the shoulder and head, but luckily nothing connected properly and soon we had his arms and legs pinned. The last officer came in and supported the patient’s head and we slowly lowered him to the ground. We had done a good job; we had our man immobilised and no one was hurt – not even the patient.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we lay there, the doctor calmly waltzed in and complimented us on such a nice takedown. He jabbed a very big injection into Mr Brown’s buttocks, then calmly removed himself from the room. It was now time for us to make our exit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt least this time I wasn’t the last out. The two lads restraining the legs exited first, and then Sergeant Perkins and I left, as we had the arms, followed very closely by the last officer who had held the head. The door slammed shut and the bolts were thrown across. Mr Brown didn’t bother to get up; he just lay there staring at the wall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt’s pretty hard to forget some of the more colourful characters and even harder to forget some of the more violent ones. It is an unfortunate fact that violence is not uncommon in a psychiatric ward, whether it is to oneself or to others. Some days it seemed as if the unit was a big cauldron, brimming with pent-up anger and excitement. Such strong emotions, such raw energy, are not easily diffused in a closed environment; they have nowhere to go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I resumed my vigil outside Mr Brown’s room, **I thought** ***about how having another male or two in this place would help.*** **Thankfully the unit eventually hired a full-time muscle man, a giant of a guy that even a crazed patient would think twice about crossing.** ***Some nurses felt this was not needed and sexist; I just thought it common sense.***\n\n...",

    "text": "One brave young man takes on gender inequality at USC  \n\nMisandry—the hatred of men—has been a staple of my polemical writing  for more than fifteen years. I felt a special obligation to hammer away  at gender myths such as intimate partner violence (women are about [as likely as men](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062022/) to initiate violence against their partners as men), false sexual allegations (a [disturbing percentage](https://medium.com/t/@jimpreston_36730/how-many-rape-accusations-are-false-f52e4c675f2a) of such allegations) and demonstrable [bias against fathers](https://theccf.ca/ideology-and-dysfunction-in-family-law/)  in family court, because male journalists who dared to write  sympathetically about men and/or critically about women put their  careers in jeopardy (no exaggeration), and most had learned to keep *shtumm* in this domain.\n\nThat  situation has been changing slowly but steadily. Some men have decided  they aren’t going to spend their lives in rhetorical purdah on the  subject of their own cultural dhimmitude, and have been stepping up to  the plate, whatever the personal cost. The university campus is home to  the feminist commissariat—and it’s a brave man who dares to stick his  head above that formidable parapet. Because the cost of doing so can be  high.\n\nThis is the story of one such activist who paid a price,  which only fueled his resistance efforts, and which in turn inspired  others, in reversing a decades-long erosion of men’s rights on campus.\n\nIn  a meeting held in June, 2017, Kursat Christoff Pekgoz was pressured by  his academic director at the University of Southern California into  terminating his PhD degree in English Literature on what Pekgoz  considered spurious and unprecedented grounds, accompanied by “many  threats and irrational exaggerations” (the meeting was recorded).  His  contract was not renewed and his funding was cut off. This is extremely  uncommon. In fact, Pekgoz is unaware of any other PhD student being  denied a doctoral degree in English Literature \\[at USC\\].\n\nThe real  reason for his PhD termination, Pekgoz alleges, is his history of gender  activism via a series of Title IX complaints against a number of  universities, such as Rutgers, [Northeastern](http://ncfm.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NCFM-Title-IX-complaint-Northeastern-University.pdf) and Georgetown, to which he added [one against USC](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/ea7b71_0c223159779e4beaaea809873f2504a7.pdf) at the end of May. As he [told a PJ Media reporter](https://pjmedia.com/trending/ph-d-student-files-federal-complaint-says-usc-retaliated-against-his-pro-men-title-ix-activism/), “They all know that I am a Title IX activist for men, with strong libertarian/conservative views.” \n\nTitle  IX’s language is very plain. It prohibits any institution from funding,  sponsoring, or listing gender-discriminatory programs and initiatives,  so for example, even listing a woman-only scholarship or placing an  employment ad specifying only women need apply runs counter to Title IX,  though such breaches happen all the time. Title IX also prohibits  discrimination in terms of counselling or health benefits. That should  mean that both men and women are treated with equal objectivity and  respect when, say, sexual-assault allegations come up for assessment.  But universities have [not covered themselves in glory](https://helpsaveoursons.com/category/fighting-back/), to say the least, on that front. \n\nIndeed,  motivation for Pekgoz’s robust activism arose in part from a Title IX  complaint against him for sexual harassment. In response, he went on  offence with a forceful and persuasive [counter-charge](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/ea7b71_16c1692eab8844218afdb2b419622827.pdf)  that his accuser had in fact sexually assaulted him (it’s worth  reading, because it offers a formidable sample of the kind of meticulous  research and annotation Pekgoz applies to every single thing he says  and writes. It does not seem to leave much wriggle room for his accuser,  and I think any objective reader would come away from it with,  minimally, doubts as to the accuser’s credibility.) \n\nIn 2018  Pekgoz complained to the Department of Education’s Office of Civil  Rights (OCR) about both USC and Yale University, prompting an  investigation into both schools’ women-only scholarships and programs,  such as a USC Women in Science and engineering group that excludes  males.\n\nLast January, Pekgoz and two former lawyers (not affiliated with Harvard University) filed a Title IX [complaint with the OCR against Harvard](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/ea7b71_85533d99ee0748ac813ca937735a4f94.pdf),  in which they rebut the received wisdom of female victimhood with an  abundance of impeccably-sourced evidence demonstrating the various ways  in which men are discriminated against in society and on campus.  Notably, “the overwhelming majority of all persons sanctioned under  Title IX theory are male. However, there is good evidence that men and  women experience sexual victimization at equal rates and the majority of  male victims [report female perpetrators](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1752928X11001569). The majority of Title IX administrators are women.”\n\nAlso in the Harvard complaint is a reference to Supreme Court prohibitions against male-gender discrimination. In [*Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan*,](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mississippi-University-for-Women-v-Hogan)  for example, the Supreme Court held that denying male admission to  nursing courses was impermissible under the Equal Protection Clause of  the Fourteenth Amendment. They wrote that a sex classification must be  “…determined through reasoned analysis rather than through the  mechanical application of traditional, often inaccurate, assumptions  about the proper roles of men and women. … Thus, if the statutory  objective is to exclude or ‘protect’ members of one gender because they  are presumed to suffer from an inherent handicap or to be innately  inferior, the objective itself is illegitimate.” This statement would  seem to undermine the reflexive argument adduced by feminists that  affirmative action for women is still necessary because of historic  disadvantage or because there are more *Fortune 500* male CEOs than women.\n\nThe  most interesting complaint to the OCR, because it reveals the distance  the men’s rights movement has come from its first tentative and atomized  beginnings two decades ago, is the one led by Pekgoz [against Cornell University](https://www.scribd.com/document/399202262/Coalition-Complaint#from_embed) in February, which Pekgoz described in an  [interview with *Campus Reform*](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=11853) as “one of the worst in the nation” for anti-male bias. \n\nThe  document contains a “list of exclusionary programs” at Cornell, such as  the lack of a Men’s Resource Center to balance the women’s Center, or a  Men’s Health Center to balance the Iris Cantor Women’s Health Center.  Likewise – even though “men are twice as likely to have heart attacks  through life than women” – there is a women’s Heart Program, but none  for men.\n\nBut the list itself, while interesting, is not what is  most significant about the Cornell complaint. Rather it is the public  support for the complaint amongst Pekgoz’s colleagues and from many  respected public intellectuals, such as American Enterprise Institute  scholar and feminist critic [Christina Hoff Summers](https://www.aei.org/author/christina-hoff-sommers/),  that lend unusual moral weight to its claims. More than 185 professors,  scholars and activists signed on to it, including Canada’s own Jordan  B. Peterson, arguably the most recognizable and inspirational spokesman  for gender equality in the world today. Peterson referenced Title IX’s  long association with women’s rights succinctly: “what’s sauce for the  goose is sauce for the gander.”\n\nPeter Wood, president of the National Association of Scholars, told *Campus Reform*  that he had signed the complaint because it “addresses a fundamental  unfairness in contemporary America, centred in our colleges and  universities” and because “it shows that exclusionary practices create a  hostile environment” for men, some caused by an “animus against males  perpetrated by feminist ideology.” Lawrence Alexander, a law professor  at the University of San Diego, told *Campus Reform* that he signed because “its allegations are true and even understated.”\n\nSuch  public affirmation on men’s behalf by high-status academics in  prestigious institutions represents something like a tipping point in  the gender wars, it seems to me. Margaret C. Valois, a Virginia-based  Title IX attorney who specializes in defending accused male students  filed a similar Title IX complaint against Tulane University and [obtained a win](http://www.aei.org/publication/successful-title-ix-complaint-forces-tulane-university-to-end-gender-discrimination/)  recently. Valois, Pekgoz and another aggressive veteran in the battle  for gender equality, Professor Mark Perry of the University of  Michigan-Flint, are profiled by anti-feminist Canadian vlogger Janice  Fiamengo, a signatory to the Cornell complaint, in [Episode 94 of her popular Fiamengo File](https://inclip.top/studiobrule/aLDRY3qCkmjIuoI/will-2019-be-the-year-of-mra-lawsuits-tff-episode-94.html) series, titled “Will 2019 Be the Year of MRA Lawsuits?”\n\nWill  it? It does seem that we are at a pivotal moment—that there is a  powerful current of social unease, running just below the still  hegemonically feminist surface, with the unfettered misandry that  pervades our culture. In Pekgoz’s Harvard complaint, for example, he  notes that whenever the Department of education investigates an  institution for anti-male discrimination, public attitudes on the issue  are on the side of men: “\\[A\\]ccording to a recent poll conducted by  YouGov, 69% of all Americans believe that men face discrimination to  some extent. 74% of men believe that such discrimination occurs, while  63% of women agree that men face some degree of discrimination.”\n\nFiamengo points to what she ([and I](http://www.barbarakay.ca/articles/view/1297)) consider radical feminism’s shark-jumping moment, the publication in the *Washington Post* of Northeastern University academic Suzanna Danuta Walters’s odiously misandric June, 2018 article, “[Why can’t we hate men](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-cant-we-hate-men/2018/06/08/f1a3a8e0-6451-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html)?” which earned her a [Title IX complaint](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=11249) filed by the National Coalition for Men [(NCFM).](https://ncfm.org/)  Walters doubtless expected her screed would find the passive acceptance  such anti-male rants often have done in the past, but was clearly  startled by the fierce blowback she received.\n\nA final word about  Kursat Christoff Pekgoz. I don’t know him personally, but from his  history, I would say that the USC Literature department picked the wrong  guy to tangle with when they forced him out of his PhD program. This is  a young man, now 30-something, who comes from Turkey, a land where they  play political hardball, and backing the wrong horse can earn you  something worse than a Twitter mobbing. He learned about activism in  what we might call an “unsafe space.”\n\nPekgoz’s [*curriculum vitae*](https://www.kursatchristoffpekgoz.com/)  informs us that In Turkey Pekgoz went out on potentially dangerous  political limbs. He took part in the Republic protests of 2007 against  fundamentalist Islam, as well as a protest against Islamist hate speech  targeting Armenian and Jewish minorities in 2009, amongst other forays.  He advocated against electoral fraud by the Islamist regime. He taught *pro bono* for an anti-Islamist organization that seeks to eliminate illiteracy among young women in Ankara (real feminism in action). \n\nAll  this speaks to character. For relentless discipline and determination  in achieving goals, add this salient fact: As a long-distance swimmer,  Pekgoz has covered 11,000 m in the open sea, with the best speed of  5,000 m in 130 minutes. This is in seawater with a temperature of 17C.  Don’t look to such a man to truckle to latte-sipping ideologues  trafficking in gender injustice. Ever.\n\nAccording to his bio,  Pekgoz has “perfect pitch.” He means musically, of course. But it may be  the case that he has perfect cultural pitch as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.thepostmillennial.com/one-brave-young-man-takes-on-gender-inequality-at-usc/](https://www.thepostmillennial.com/one-brave-young-man-takes-on-gender-inequality-at-usc/)",

    "text": "List of Men's Rights Issues Just what I see as important, with a few sources.\n\n###Labor, work / life balance\n* Men work longer hours than women\n* Men work more difficult jobs than women\n* Men suffer from greater rates of occupational health problems (black lung disease, mesotheleoma, etc)\n* Men are more likely to die on the job\n* Men receive fewer benefits like paid time off, paid medical leave, and health insurance\n* Men have less free time to see a doctor, and often do not have medical coverage to pay for a doctor\n* As a result of many of the above, men live shorter, disease ridden lives, but retirement age is the same as (and sometimes higher than) women\n\n###Household responsibilities\n* Men do most of the dangerous, dirty, and difficult work around the home\n* Men get nagged, harassed, and bossed around inside their home ([source 1](https://public.psych.iastate.edu/ccutrona/psych592a/articles/Vogel%202007.pdf), [source 2](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2008/09/25/women-call-the-shots-at-home-public-mixed-on-gender-roles-in-jobs/), [source 3](https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle-2-15039/women-decide-to-rule-the-roost-1-1503380))\n* The total amount of time men spend at work and at home doing chores and child care is more than the amount of time women spend on these activities ([source 1 (Pew)](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/ft_18-05-01_fathersday_time/), [source 2 (US BLS)](https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4635193/Screen_Shot_2014-06-18_at_12.56.18_PM.png), [source 3](https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-myth-of-the-lazy-father))\n* Men have less time to themselves for leisure, self care, napping, and sleeping, compared to women (source: same as above)\n* The way society views all of the above is completely backwards: women complain about men and about the amount of work that men do, often portraying men as lazy or incompetent (see [source 3](https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-myth-of-the-lazy-father) from above), despite the fact that, if anyone has room to complain, it's men, not women\n\n###Masculinity and Misandry\n* Men are attacked for behaving like men.  Husbands are attacked for behaving like husbands.  Fathers are attacked for behaving like fathers.  And boys are attacked (and often medicated, shamed, and disciplined) for behaving like boys.\n* The vast majority of media representations of men in TV, movies, and commercials, are negative ([source (from rbomi)](https://archive.is/NHC61))\n* Even when men are portrayed positively in the media, it's usually because they have abandoned masculine traits and embraced feminine traits instead (so a man is seen as a bad guy when he was acting like a man, and later a good guy when he \"connects with his feminine side\") (source: same as above)\n* Misandry is widespread throughout all of society and is widely accepted.  Many people do not know when they are being misandrist, or that it's even possible to be misandrist.\n* Men are shamed and attacked with words like *creep*, *pervert*, *incel*, *deadbeat*,and *rapist*\n* These types of slurs should be considered equally sexist / bigoted as words like \"thug\" for black people or \"wetback\" for hispanics\n* Men's behavior is highly regulated by women and female shaming behavior\n* The clothing that men are allowed to wear is highly regulated by women and female shaming behavior\n* It is not uncommon to hear comments about the size of a man's penis, or for women to threaten to cut off a man's penis\n* Genital mutilation is commonly used to \"fix\" behavioral \"problems\" in young boys\n\n###Education\n* Our school systems are increasingly hostile towards boys\n* Boys are treated like defective girls and their behaviors are \"corrected\" through discipline, and through medication, so that they will behave more like girls\n* Boys make worse grades than girls, and graduate at lower rates than girls (despite, in the past, doing better than girls)\n* Our education system went through several reforms to help out girls, and these reforms are responsponsible for making things worse for boys ([source](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/05/the-war-against-boys/304659/))\n* Society is hesitant to address or fix any of these issues, despite the fact that we were willing to fix these issues when they first effected girls\n\n###Wealth gap\n* Single women make more money than single men\n* Millennial women make more money than millennial men\n* Women as a whole own more wealth than men do -- most \"money\" in society belongs to women ([source 1](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/bmo-report-despite-controlling-14-trillion-in-wealth-american-women-still-have-challenges-to-overcome-2015-04-02-13173119), [source 2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2010/07/28/women-making-economic-strides-and-not-slowing-down/)).\n* The expectation is for men to spend money on women, not the reverse\n* Women spend their boyfriend's and husband's money, often even when they make more than their boyfriend / husband\n* Women very often receive large portions of a man's assets and future income in a divorce, which contributes significantly to the wealth gap\n\n###Divorce and child custody\n* Courts have an obvious anti-male bias when it comes to divorce settlmenets, child custody cases, and awarding child support\n* Laws concerning marriage, divorce, child custody, and child support, are sexist, and often times name \"husband / wife\" and \"father / mother\" directly in the legal language\n* Even when this is not the case, the effect of these laws are still sexist, in much the same way that drug laws and drug enforcement have been acused of being racist ([source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Jim_Crow))\n* Women should not be allowed to walk away with a substantial amount of the man's money and assets from a divorce\n* Women should be forced to work a job instead of receiving child support, alimony, and welfare\n* Men should receive default 50 / 50 custody without having to pay child support.  Men should not have to go to court, pay court fees, hire lawyers, and argue their case in court.\n* It is not fair for a man to work full time, take 50% of the child rearing responsibilities, and still pay child support.  If a man can work and still put in his fair share, then so can a woman.\n\n###Police brutality and legal discrimination\n* Men are discriminated against in almost every aspect of the legal system.  In many cases this discrimination is *worse* than it is for minorities.\n\n###Domestic abuse, rape, and violence against men\n* The Deluth model of domestic abuse is overtly sexist against men\n* Women physically assault men at equal and sometimes greater rates than the reverse\n* Domestic abuse that includes yelling, gaslighting, and emotional abuse, are probably much higher than what's reported, and men likely make up a majority of the victims\n* Nagging, harassing, henpecking, and bossy behavior from wives and SOs should be counted as domestic abuse\n* Taking advantage of a man for his money should be considered a form of \"financial abuse\"\n* Men are raped at equal rates as women but there is very little awareness for this.  Most men are raped by women, not by other men ([source 1](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known/), [source 2](http://webshare.law.ucla.edu/Faculty/bibs/stemple/Stemple-SexualVictimizationPerpetratedFinal.pdf)).\n* Men are viewed as being more dangerous or violent than women, despite there being clear gender parity when it comes to domestic abuse and sexual assault\n* As a result, men receive less support and there is less awareness for these problems in comparison to women\n* Men who are raped suffer from greater rates of emotional trauma than women do\n* Women who rape men tend to be more violent and are more likely to use force than men.\n* There is a widespread and rampant \"rape culture\" against men: many women do not believe that it is possible to rape a man, and as a result women are more likely to step over boundaries in ways that men don't.\n* Many people do not view abusive behaviors from women in the same light as those same behaviors from men ([source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8006596_Psychologists'_Judgments_of_Psychologically_Aggressive_Actions_When_Perpetrated_by_a_Husband_Versus_a_Wife))\n* Men are often viewed as the more responsible party than women\n\n###Men and Minorities\n* Many areas of men's rights and minority rights intersect, with minority men facing problems from both racism and sexism\n* Examples include police profiling, police brutality, and racist / sexist comments and behaviors\n* Men are often treated like criminals, and this treatment is even worse for minority men\n* White men perform worse than white women in almost every single aspect of life, with the exception of job earnings (which is largely the result of men working more hours, more difficult jobs, and having a worse work/life balance compared to women)\n* Minority men perform worse than minority women in every single metric you can look at, including job earnings\n* Minority women perform better than white men in some areas, like when it comes to police brutality, police profiling, and discrimination in the court system\n* Who has it worse: Men, or minorities?  Obviously it is minority men.  It is not true that minority women have things worse.\n* Joking about minority women somehow having things worse has created a culture of denial over men's issues and the problems that minority men face.",

    "text": "Feminism: Enabling Female Psychopaths Men and women, and gender fluid, nonbinary, persons of colour, LGBTIQ+ persons, (and definitely not privileged white men), we got a lot right in the Western world since World War 2. Two things amaze me about the organization of Western society. One, society has so effectively removed the opportunities for the psychopathic individuals to thrive with one exception. Two, that one exception is feminist psychopathy directed to men.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTeachers can't smack, gropers get caught on camera and imprisoned, there's enough prosperity that generally people have an option other than staying when their romantic partner is abusive, workplace bullying no longer flies like it used to, by and large violence between men is far less tolerated, child abuse is not kept silent about but every effort is expended in its prevention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn other words, the many 'hunting grounds' the psychopath might have previously used to express his or her disregard for the rights of others have been closed off or at least curtailed severely. However, all is not lost for the psychopath, because a new hunting ground has been opened with a numerous prey, and all one needs to be given an open season ticket to hunt is a vagina. (No, sorry MTFs, I doubt a surgically constructed one would give you full hunting rights, but you could always try).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe major thing I have noticed in the course of my life is the manner in which feminism has given massive cover for antisocial and psychopathic women to harm men. It's the only context that I'm aware of in Western societies where this 'privilege' exists. Try treating blacks, Asians, Hispanics, spastics, the blind, homosexuals, Muslims or Parsis like this, and you'll lose your job quicker than you can say, 'our company doesn't stand for discrimination'. But treat a man this way, go right ahead! Because if you are a psychopathic woman mistreating a man YOU WILL NOT FACE SOCIETY'S USUAL CENSURE AND CONDEMNATION OF SUCH BEHAVIOUR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have experienced this myself, from quite an early age in fact, although generally speaking I believe I have avoided the harsher edge of this reality. Employment is the obvious context this comes to mind - a female boss or even colleague can make hell for a male subordinate, she's got cover. If the guy were to do a tenth of that to a woman, he'd be up before HR with, 'do it again and you're out', warning at the very least. I don't know how it is in America, but in Australia my understanding is female managers are brought in directly so they can work on firing a sufficiently difficult female staff member - the male managers are scared of doing it, so will often be swapped out for the termination process. I've mostly had very good female bosses, but the behavior of some women colleagues I've dealt with (and yes, they were disproportionately lesbian) clearly indicated that they had cover AND THEY KNEW THEY HAD COVER.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the problem, women in Western society know they've got cover when they have a dispute or conflict with a man. This kind of imbalance is always a problem, it's destabilizing, but that's not what I'm talking about here, the everyday woman getting her way because she knows she can. I'm talking about the genuinely antisocial and psychopathic woman, the woman who has a genuine contempt for humanity. This is a very small subset of the human population, but they cause enormous havoc and harm. We cannot do anything, as a society, to stop a certain number of psychopaths growing to maturity every year, they are an indelible part of the tapestry of human existence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut while in the past we've often allowed them to predate because of indifference - who cares about the poor? - or fear - I'd better not criticize Stalin. I cannot think of a time, before the current state of affairs emerged somewhere in the 1990s as far as I can tell, where we have without a violent change of government given them complete cover for their actions, and in fact supported them in the very process of their psychopathic abuse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I was young in the early 1990s my older sibling, who was sometimes violent, poured boiling coffee on my back. I had to get burns treatment at the local hospital, and the young male doctor there asked me if my father had done it. No, I said, my sibling did it. He asked the question, while he treated me, about three additional times. A more suggestible kid could easily have given the answer he was so clearly fishing for. I remember years later, a fully fledge adult, I talked to a therapist. He wanted to know all about how abusive and violent my father was (somewhat abusive, virtually never violent). He sympathized, he understood. But he didn't want to hear me say anything negative about my mother, who I certainly believe had psychopathic tendencies and who has wrought mental destruction on my siblings, particularly my younger sister. At the time it didn't register, but later I started thinking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was watching a YouTube video that discussed the fact that men's rights groups were banned as student clubs on Canadian campuses. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s4sZi8zjzY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s4sZi8zjzY) here's the link. A woman and man who appeared to be from ethnic minority backgrounds argued up hill and down dale why such groups were an evil fifth column that should be banned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe woman, who appeared to be Indian Canadian, even suggested men's groups might be more acceptable if they talked about 'the real issues', such as the plight of 'men of color' and 'transgender men', and she intimated that her white fellow panelist, supportive of freedom of speech, should zip it, and, all class, she seemed to mock him being of an older generation. She and the other man who spoke in her support against men's rights - who also appeared to belong to an ethnic minority, but seemed to be motivated more by sureing up his liberal credentials for political reasons than psychopathy - hinted that 'straight white men' should put up and shut up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen there are the news reports Canada will give 95% of its foreign aid for women and girls. Well, that's nice...if you're a psychopath, and somehow find boys dying of HIV in Africa okay while girls dying of HIV in Africa not okay. Anyone who has lived in a developing country knows this is what it means, it's not some theoretical institute that spouts hatred we're talking about, it's for the basics - and the Canadian government has literally said girls' lives matter, little boys' lives don't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've heard female family court judges expressly say they love the job because they can use it to deny custody to fathers. It's not so much the fact women are helped when men aren't that disturbs me - sure, it's unfair that men don't get special teaching places reserved for them to balance the gender numbers, but women get engineering places because WE MUST have gender balanced numbers there. But what I'm talking about is seeing the malice of genuinely psychopathic women given extraordinary rein to harm and injure men, and inevitably, their girlfriends and wives and children. I have seen time and again so many feminists truly motivated more by a desire to hurt men than help women. Brett Kavanaugh, an innocent man with wife and daughters - fuck it, hurting him with disproven falsehoods is more important than considering the welfare impact of this on his wife and daughters. It is more important to hurt a man than help a woman, which would make sense to the psychopath, right, because the psychopath disregards everyone except themselves including women. It's just that the direct harm is allowed to be delivered to the man, and all well and good if the indirect harm then flows to the women in that man's life. What isn't allowed, under feminisms perverted rules, is for the harm to be directed DIRECTLY to another woman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt reminded me of what Cassie Jaye said in an interview, if I'm paraphrasing right, feminism isn't about helping women, it's about helping feminism. I'd go a step further, feminism isn't about helping women, it's about hurting men directly even if this indirectly hurts the women connected to men.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will be blunt. The majority of the most extremely hateful behavior I've seen has been from women who either openly self-identify as, or who the inferential evidence indicates are, lesbian. I've seen it from both straight and lesbian women, but I would say most of the most extreme psychopathic and antisocial behavior I have seen by women against men has been from lesbian women. I am not saying lesbian women have a greater incidence of psychopathy, I do not know if there is - or whether there would even be allowed to take place - research into this. But this is what I have seen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to leave everyone on a negative note. So I'd just like to add that this problem has gotten consistently worse over the last 20 years I have observed it and every indication is it is going to continue to get worse. There appears to be no catalyst or force to change this, and so, I would expect, an increase in psychopathic and antisocial behavior in society by a small minority of women against a lot of men.",

    "text": "I want to unlearn everything I know about being a woman I feel confused and off the textbook. It’s exhausting to re-evaluate everything I was ever taught about how to be a girl. Society, family, friends, strangers, all forms of media. Everything that raises someone feels like a hostile entity to me now. Like, I came from a heavily conservative, misogynistic house. 18 years of solid training about how women are subhuman, and feminists are literally demons. The only women ever spoken about well in my family were the ones drinking beer and saying “they don’t need feminism!!” Most of what I was given to watch and read came from the “better days” when women knew their place, so I consumed so much 50s and 60s content. All the sexist tv shots of docile little women submitting to their rapey, off to save the day husbands. I was homeschooled with heavily biased curriculum, bought from old religious companies. Giving me the view that the only way to be a good girl was either to be a nun or pure mother. Eventually when I went to public school my parents wrote me exemption notes to keep me out of health, sex ed, or any “propaganda” classes where I actually could have learned something about my body or what women are capable of doing. As a child I was stuck in the house doing chores since as long as I can remember, watching my brothers play on every sunny day and expressly told that it was because of being a girl that I couldn’t be a kid first. And yet my brothers grew up like idiots, not knowing how to feed themselves, wash clothes, clean a dish, and they continually talked bad about all the women they struck out with and how they’re stupid sluts for not wanting to be their pregnant at home maid by the second date. Any time we walked by someone wearing a bikini, or skinny jeans, or a tank top, my mom would pull me in the opposite direction and growl about what trashy feminist scum they must be. I myself was never allowed to leave my room in anything less than complete coverage. Couldn’t wear pjs or shorts around the house because of the men that lived there. My own family. That I was made to feel uncomfortable showing an ankle around. By 9 I was wearing bras every day, even sleeping in them because if I woke up during the night to use the bathroom and my mom saw me, it was hell for not being properly dressed. Also by 9 I had my period, something I never understood a thing about and wasn’t allowed to speak of. We had a code word for it. We double bagged and hid all tampons and pads, and weren’t allowed to be in any visible pain or difference during that week. Although mine was more like every day, or not for months. The pain was insane. The doctors visits stopped as soon as they suggested birth control or monitoring my ovarian cysts. I was eventually thrown out of the house for daring, at 18, to have a boyfriend and was caught sending flirty texts. \n\nI’m perpetually frustrated. Many things don’t feel right, but I’m told by everything around me that it is and I’m the crazy one. How do I know what to do? How do I know which parts of me are products of a misogynistic upbringing? I wouldn’t even consider myself a feminist for a year after leaving home, thinking it was a curse word and turned me into a terrible person. But when I realized the truth I jumped wholly on board. It’s equality, it’s freedom from the oppression, femicide, and degradation women even in the West face everyday. And it pisses men off. But I don’t care anymore. I even had a “not like other girls” stint where I thought that it was right to wolf whistle and ogle women like a man does, or distance myself from anything “normal girls” do. I felt I had to swallow my discomfort with media like game of thrones, which made me feel gross with the excessive nudity and rape, and that I had to nod approvingly and talk about how hot tit girl #2 was. It feels wrong. But it’s so much easier than fighting every. Inch. Of. Reality. That shoved into my face how little a girls’ opinion matter. Is there some kind of guidebook for this? For finding out how to free oneself from internalized misogyny and sexist cultural upbringing, and how not to go crazy feeling like the only one in a man’s world that takes issue with some things??",

    "text": "My story of facing abortion laws in Alabama I posted this in The Handmaid's Tale reddit last night, and I would like to share it here as well. \nPerhaps something positive can come from a horrible experience, I would love to prevent another woman from being denied a choice about her body. \n\nYesterday, Women's Rights in my state, as well as the surrounding states, took a huge leap backwards. I guestimate that if I or someone I love required an abortion we may have to drive hundreds of miles.....(I have been to upset to research Florida and Texas laws to confirm this).\n\nPlease allow me to share my story. A few years ago I was a resident (temporarily ) of Alabama while my husband was stationed there for work. I was 21 weeks pregnant, and although feeling a bit ill, went to our ultrasound appointment with feelings of joy and curiosity to learn the baby's gender. Instead, like so many other women before me, we heard the deafening silence of no fetal heartbeat. We were crushed. Suddenly my supposed UTI infection and resulting fever had more gruesome implications. My son was dead. My son was dead inside of me, for an unknown amount of time. \n\nMy shock was begining to transition to grief when all of those emotions were forced on hold. My husband and I began to fear how sick I was becoming and listening for next steps. There were none. Although I had a fever and clear signs of an infection starting, the doctors informed me that there was nothing that they could do. My body had not initiated the process of labor, but they were sending me home. Why? And this.....this is a quote, \"We do not perform abortions,\". I was told this by 3 separate Dr's over the next week and a half, each day more sick and weaker than the last. Abortion is not allowed. One physician, to his credit, said that he wished that he could help me, but due to regulations and the funding for the hospital the procedure was not only prohibited, there was not even the equipment present he would need. The only clarity I was given was that before 20 weeks it would be considered a miscarriage, after 20 weeks it is considered stillbirth. Yet, neither term explains why my health and life was jeopardized. \n\nEspecially bizzare, if what Alabama was against was a D&C procedure, (referring to it as \"abortion\"), bc I ultimately did not have a D&C. Did Alabama laws consider inducing labor an abortion as well? I will never understand. \n\nWe drove hours to my home state, where I was immediately admitted and given pitocin (I assume, it was a labor inducing medication) and my son was stillborn a few hours later. \n\nI have never gotten over the shock of that experience, of being told repeatedly that my body was not important. That my body was not under my decisions or choices..... that regulations would allow my body to be compromised, weakened, and sickened... Not to mention the emotional trauma it caused.  I apologize that this is not as articulate as I would hope, even now this is difficult to write. \nSince then I have lost 2 loved ones to sepsis, and I realize how fortunate I was to have found help before the infection reached my bloodstream. \n\nAlabama has doubled down on their abortion laws, and now my state has followed suit. The \"heartbeat\" law went into effect July 1. Most women do not even know they are pregnant before 6 weeks.... and often a heartbeat can be detected then. Effectively making abortion all but illegal in my state and my neighboring state of Louisiana as well (if their law passed as mine did). \n\nI am pro-choice. Being pro-choice, for me personally, means that I respect others beliefs but also do not believe a law should decide. That means that I can respect some who is pro-life's beliefs as well, I just do not think it should be LAW. Isn't that the point of our democracy? Isn't there supposed to be a seperation of church and state?\n\nBeing from MS, I cannot say these things in general conversation without outcry by most. Not even to most of my (non immediate) family members. This state is the definition of the bible belt. Abortion, to MS, equals killing innocent babies. That does not happen to be my belief, and to most of the people saying this it would also never occur to them to check their white privilege / middle class privilege. I try to. I imagine myself, if my daughter needed me, driving to Canada if that is what it took for her to exercise her right to chose. Yet I know that so, so many women would not have the means to do that. That these laws will force many, many to become mothers when they know they are not in the position, mental, physical, or financial state, etc to bring a child into the world. \n\nUnfortunately there are cries of, \"keep your legs closed, slut!!\", and very little research into the truths of abortion. A lot of cries for \"saving the precious babies\", and very little research into more effective birth control regulations, sexual education, reproductive healthcare, and adoption policies that would serve their purposes more accurately. \n\nIt is tragic that they cannot see how damaging these laws are. I pray they never find themselves forced to view their deceased unborn son as a threat to their health rather than simply a tragedy to mourn.\n\nAs a young woman with an incurable and progressive genetic disorder called Ehlers-Danlos, my prior pregnancy put a huge strain on my body and progressed my joint instability. I was diagnosed later in life, and I do not regret for a moment being pregnant. I use my cane gladly, I adore being a mother. However, even at 36, with a tubal, I know that if that were to fail I could become pregnant again. It would be devastating for my body to carry another child. I would be in a wheelchair, possibly the rest of my life. Like I said, I am 36. No, it would not be fatal, necessarily, but it would destroy the life that I have. Shouldn't that be MY choice? If my healthy sexlife resulted in an unplanned pregnancy, for me to make the right/best choice for myself and my family?\n\nI could try to rally a protest. It would fail. I write letters, I contribute......but it feels futile here in the south. \n\nI apologize, I just realized how lengthy this has become, so thank you if you read this far. I only write this for encouragement, fight. Please fight for yourself in your states. Please. If anyone is in the south and is fighting, let me know and I will gladly join. I even have a handmaid's costume from last Halloween ready to go. \n\nIn Georgia a woman can now be prosecuted if she leaves the state for an abortion. Imagine that. If a woman left a bad relationship, terminated a pregnancy and the man found out he could have her prosecuted simply for spite!\n\nOn the news tonight is the story of a 5 month pregnant woman who was shot during an argument and SHE has been charged with the death of the baby bc she started the argument. The actual shooter was not charged. \n\nAs I said, it is frightening to witness this happening and seeing no response from women here. \n\nLove and light to you all. Sorry for typos, would be difficult for me to go back and proofread.",

    "text": "Finding Strength in the Classics - Long read, but I need your words! \\*\\*I understand this is a long post but stick with me!  I need your strength, your words, your thoughts.\\*\\*\n\nI work in the construction industry.  I am the lowest paid employee on our payroll.  My dad is the owner, my brother is a project manager, and I work in the office doing invoicing, dispatching, HR, and payroll.  I am the first person in my family (on either side) to go to college.  I have a BA in Psychology and Women's Studies.  \n\nAt work my dad and brother refer to me (34 years old) and the office manager (61) as \"girls\".  For example, \"I'm not sure about the PO#, ask the girls\".\n\nOne of our employees is blatantly disrespectful.  He was not doing something he should have been doing.  I told him via e-mail.  He blew up, marched past my office and into my brother's office to talk about it.  I got up and told him that I wrote the e-mail, and that my brother had nothing to do with it.  He stormed out of my brother's office.  I told my brother to refer him back to me next time.  This has happened 3 times.  The disrespect he shows irks me.  To be clear, my brother is NOT my boss.  We will take over the company TOGETHER when my dad retires in the next five years.    \n\nMy dad will ask that I take off work to take my grandma (his mother) to the dentist/doctors appointments.  He has never asked my brother.  We are equally as busy.\n\nI've been told by my dad regarding my financial struggles, \"Maybe if you lost some weight, you'd find a good man that will take care of you.\"  \n\nFor the record I am a single mom.  I have my daughter (age 11) all week.  Her dad takes her every weekend and pays child support.  I also own my own home and rent out an apartment above my garage for extra income.  I drive for Uber in the evenings and on weekends for extra cash.  I'm doing just fine.  \n\nI work hard.  I'm good at my job.  I've done big things for this company and am proud of those accomplishments.  However, I am exhausted by being continually undermined.  At times I feel powerless.  I am SO frustrated. \n\nSo in order to make myself feel better, I've found comfort in the \"Classics\".  I am reading The Feminine Mystique in its entirety.  I've watched documentaries on feminist icons.  I've found comfort in the words of Gloria Steinem.  I have revisited old notes and texts from college.  I've found Reddit and this thread.  I'm still frustrated.  \n\nThis is a plea for good news.  For advice.  For a sense of community.  Help me sisters and sister supporters!  Comment about your personal feminist victories.  We are stronger together - help me find mine through your words.",
