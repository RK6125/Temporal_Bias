    "text": "I'm 34, hold a Physical Oceanography degree, a PGCE in Physics and a distinction in a Masters of Computer Science and can't get a job in IT. As the title says. I was lazy and not confident in myself at school. I found I really enjoyed academia after I failed my secondary (high) school examinations and worked hard to rebuild myself. I had no life for 6 years doing night schools, working in part time jobs and earned a 2:1 in Physics and Ocean Sciences. I had learnt what a work ethic was and I was doing well. \n\nI got a great job working for the Oil and Gas industry, travelled the world, and was thriving. I never turned down a job for fear of being fired, and I earned a lot of money (which I later blew on an an expensive car!) I became a confident individual, but found it hard to settle down with anyone, and also felt really guilty because of climate change and so I gave it up after 4 years.\n\nI became a secondary school teacher to try and teach about Climate Change and 'make a difference'. It was definitely not for me, I became a stressed angry monster because I wanted to do the job well, but there was so much out of my control and was really overworked for no reason. After my second year I gave it up, but I'm grateful for it because it gave me two amazing life skills: communication and organisation, and I wake up everyday looking at a sticker I made on my wall - **#AtLeastI'mNotATeacherAnymore**\n\nI then gained a distinction in Computer Science at Masters Level. It taught me the very basics of programming and database design amongst many other aspects, some of which I was great at such as project management and discrete mathematics. I'm very slowly getting up to speed with modern IT architectures in my own time. I'm in a crappy job as the only IT person who's blamed for things going wrong, with a legacy system that's 15+ years old and the business don't have a clue how to manage it. I have too much pressure and not enough support for the position I'm in and I abhor it. Even when I say something to my managers like \"I need someone above me who knows more than me\" or \"I'm trying my hardest to make this work\", it either gets ignored or I get told to keep my chin up. I've also just got married to a woman who's amazing, but reluctant to move which limits my opportunities.\n\nI have since applied for meteorological offices, small companies, graduate schemes, and even back offshore but for the life of me I can't get a job. Sometimes I don't get any feedback (*we have too many applicants to give individuals feedback*) and when I do get feedback it's always positive, but just came down to I don't have any experience. I don't know if I'll ever get a job in this field, or any of my previous roles. It's got to a point where I now feel like they're lying to me when they give me positive feedback because otherwise, why wouldn't I have been given a job!? I have no self worth anymore and all these qualifications don't feel like an achievement when I constantly get rejected from positions. \n\nI'm considering life coaches to build my confidence back up, or counselling to try and get past these resentful feelings I'm having. I'm even considering re-training in something hands-on like an electrician, or starting my own business. I'm reluctant to pay for anymore education or courses that don't yield something specific, I've done enough for most people's lifetime! And so I turn to the amazing users of Reddit, where any help about what to do, where to go, or just telling me I'm being stupid would be greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "Asking about your predecessor Background: I just got an offer for a new job as the Director of a childcare within a large church (I myself am not religious but have been promised I will not have anything to do with the religious aspects of the program). \n\nI am coming up on nearly 8 years at my current workplace, which I have finally decided to leave for a multitude of reasons; primarily that I have been qualified for the director role for a few years now and am only being held back by my director's contract length. She was not up front with me regarding her length and has been telling me for nearly 3 years that she plans to leave 'soon', at which point her position will be mine. Finally, she let me know that she will be at least another 3 years in the position, at which point I started looking elsewhere. \n\nThrough the interviewing process at this church - which has a larger amount of resources, is licensed for more children, offering me higher salary and position, and seemingly happier/less stressful environment - they asked that I meet a couple staff members to see how we get along. One of the staff members has been with the church for 20+ years and working in the childcare & preschool section since it opened almost 5 years ago. It seems as though since she has been there since the beginning and holds a non-official leadership role in the team, they wanted her to have a chance to put in her 2 cents (though they were clear that this would not necessarily impact their decision to hire). \n\nWhile talking with this teacher, her main point seemed to revolve around the previous director and how he was let go. My understanding through our conversation is that he was separated from the team quickly and with little notice, and that the team is still slightly shocked and some of them upset by the loss, as he supported the team and did his job well, his are big shoes to fill. She also mentioned that dispite the quick loss of the position, he still brings his children to the center with his 'head held high'. \n\nI did a little digging and found the man online, and learned that he is the only director that has been there since they opened the childcare location. \n\nThis leaves me to wonder, what is the reason for the quick separation? The lack of director has obviously put them in a tough spot since March, as the woman who hired me (Director of Operations) has no childcare experience and seems to be struggling to make decisions based on any sort of logic in relation to the guiding factors of childcare such as licensing and accreditation criteria, etc. \n\nWould it be appropriate for me to ask the director of operations what the reason for the quick dismissal of my predecessor was? Mind you, I didn't ask to speak to the staff, she asked me and left me with them. My thought was to approach with, 'when I met with X, she mentioned the original director quite a bit and said that the team was still quite shocked by his hasty separation from the institution, if it's not too sensitive, may I ask what lead to the quick dismissal?' \n\nIs this a faux pas, or a smart move?",

    "text": "Dilemma: Quitting job halfway through training after promotion? I’m an administrative assistant right now. Been with the company 10 months, love my current supervisor and people I work with. To keep a long story short (is it ever), in June, I get a call that the administrative manager of the company wants me to interview for a supervisor position in another company that she works with. Suspicious but ok. I don’t hear about this position for WEEKS I have to follow up multiple times, finally I get an interview. The day of the interview the same woman comes to me and says soooo you can still interview BUT we have the same position here at (current company) and I could get you more money blah blah. I say I would like to stay with my current company. 2.5 months go by. Yes 2.5 months, again multiple follow ups, i was giving up hope, and I finally get an interview with who I’d be working with. That was early September. I don’t hear anything for a month again until I find out they’re planning my transfer without asking if I even want the position but I finally get a call asking, I say yes because what do I have to lose I’m young and it’s more money (Spoiler it’s not more money than the other place it’s actually less) but ANYWAY… Next week I’m starting my training. I have NO documentation stating my pay, benefits, vacation, etc or job description. Nobody has told me anything just “go here and you’ll be training.” Basically they suck, super unprofessional but I was going to suck it up because it is more pay and I’m young I have nothing to lose. \n\nI get an email THIS MORNING that my public school district wants me to be a substitute teacher for them which is what I want to do with my life. I want to be a teacher that’s where my heart is. I applied months ago and just now they got back to me asking me to be a substitute. The ONLY thing that is making me question it is that I would be putting my two weeks in halfway through the first month of my training for this managers position. I feel like that is super unprofessional and crappy and just not good. But then again they messed with me for nearly 5 months and still are, why should I even care what they think? I really don’t need the references I have plenty outside of this job. I just feel bad doing that and like it’s the wrong thing to do to people who thought I’d be there to help out but like this is the rest of my life potentially. Any advice,  am I wrong quitting halfway through or should I not care with the way they treated me?",

    "text": "\"no, that's not what women look like\" So I'm a woman, and i went to a trade School for game and cgi creation, specifically in the film class. We were sculpting bodies, and i chose to sculpt a woman as a warm up (I've been in art classes my whole life, I'm pretty familiar with sculpture, and drawing anatomy, and transferring to digital wasn't that big of an issue)\n\nThis other teacher who \"specializes\" in digital sculpting came in to teach us the basics. I was practically finished with mine, just fine tuning musculature, fat placement, etc. He comes up to me and says\n\n \"no, that's not what women look like, you need to pull the hips out and synch the waist. The breasts go more up here as well, and face straight out.\"\n\nHe pulled the hips way out, and synched the waist and everything. Personally, being a woman, that is NOT what i see in the mirror, and i was sculpting a fine and very realistic lady, not a barbie doll, and i looked him dead in the eye and said \n\n\"that's not what I look like.\"\n \nHe was a nice guy, just had a very very strict and single minded view on the female body.\n\nEdit: awe thanks for the award<3\nEdit two: awards! <3\n\nEdit three: common question about his response, he didn't respond, he just kinda got quiet and went to help someone else lol\n\nEdit four: Jesus my phone died and this blew up, thank you guys haha here's a picture of what I can compare my sculpt with, i funny have a picture but [this](http://imgur.com/a/1vYhGjL) is really close haha\n\nEdit 5: i really didn't think so many people would hate \"synch\" so much haha i know it's \"cinch\" but I'm a slide texter and my phone is bad at words so I left it in, I'm sorry haha",

    "text": "In light of the death of Todd Akin, a Republican member of the Missouri House Representatives, who coined the term \"legitimate rape,\" I wanted to highlight some of his colleagues' comments over the years in helping perpetuate the patriarchal rape culture. In 2012, while running for the US Senate, former Missouri House Representative Todd Akin stated, [\"If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.”](https://www.politico.com/story/2012/08/akin-legitimate-rape-victims-dont-get-pregnant-079864)  As someone who [worked for IBM selling computers and ran the maintenance department at his father's steel company](https://news.stlpublicradio.org/government-politics-issues/2012-10-02/akin-embraces-image-of-minuteman-as-he-battles-establishment-including-his-own-party), it clearly gave him the expertise necessary in women's anatomy, biology, and physiology to be able to make this assertion.  Of course, as an anti-choice usurper of rights, what type of man would he be, unless he [physically restricted access to reproductive healthcare clinics for women in need](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/todd-akin-was-arrested-multiple-times-for-physically-blocking-womens-access-to-abortion-clinics-7dda2f38d322/)?\n\nAkin's son, Perry, said, [\"As my father’s death approached, we had people from all different walks of life share story after story of the personal impact he had on them.\"](https://apnews.com/article/former-rep-todd-akin-dead-0a1b944f96eee4b63d9ea57e04c44ca4)  Of this, I have no doubt.  I'm certain that there are millions of women across the globe who would have liked to share the impact your father's life had, and will continue to have, on them.\n\nIn 1990, Lawrence Lockman, a Republican member of the Maine House of Representatives wrote, while serving as director of the Pro-Life Education Association, [\"If a woman has (the right to abortion), why shouldn't a man be free to use his superior strength to force himself on a woman?  At least the rapist's pursuit of sexual freedom doesn't (in most cases) result in anyone's death.\"](https://archive.vn/5cKpD)  Well, in that case, since you make such a perfectly reasonable, rational argument...\n\nIn 1990, Texas Republican gubernatorial nominee Clayton Williams, lamenting poor weather conditions that threatened to cancel a cattle roundup at his West Texas ranch, likened the atmospheric conditions to rape, stating, [“Rape is kinda like the weather. If it’s inevitable, relax and enjoy it.”](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/personal-foul/)\n\nIn 2018, former US Rep for Iowa, Republican Steve King was asked about his stance of not allowing exceptions for either rape or incest in anti-choice legislation.  He said, [\"What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that?\"](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/14/steve-king-abortion-rape-incest-westside-conservative-iowa-representative-birth-iowa-civilization/2007230001/)  Steve King, everyone; noted critical thinker, [construction worker](http://kingconstruction.net/), and [avowed](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/413601-steve-king-members-of-nazi-linked-party-in-austria-would-be-republicans-if) and [unabashed neo-Nazi](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/13/17459908/steve-king-neo-nazi-tweet-retweet).\n\nFormer Republican Senator from Pennsylvania, Rick Santorum, most recently in the news for attempting to erase all remnants of Native Americans from North American soil ([\"We birthed a nation from nothing. I mean, there was nothing here. I mean, yes we have Native Americans but candidly there isn't much Native American culture in American culture\"](https://twitter.com/JasonSCampbell/status/1386685340522536961)), when asked what his views were on abortion in cases of rape and incest in 2012, stated, [\"...the right approach is to accept this horribly created--in the sense of rape--but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way, the gift of human life, and accept what God has given to you...We have horrible things happen.  I can't think of anything more horrible.  But, nevertheless, we have to make the best out of a bad situation.\"](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/santorum-to-rape-victims-make-the-best-out-of-a-bad-situation-a8388910c907/)  Apparently, in the case of rape, it's a gift.  It's a horribly created gift, yet nonetheless, a gift.  However, in the case of incest, it's what?  Just a regular, everyday gift?  A normal byproduct of a fully-functional family life?\n\nAlso in 2012, Richard Mourdock, a Republican candidate at the time running for Senate in Indiana, stated, [\"...I came to realize life is that gift from God.  And I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.\"](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/richard-mourdock-even-pregnancy-from-rape-something-god-intended/)\n\nIn 2014, Montana Judge Todd Baugh sentenced a 54-year-old, admitted child molester, convicted of repeatedly raping his 14-year-old female student, who committed suicide during the course of the trial, to 30 days in jail.  At sentencing, he stated that the victim [\"seemed older than her chronological age\" and was \"as much in control of the situation\"](https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/29/protesters-demand-montana-judge-resign-over-rape-sentencing/) as her rapist.  One month later, in an interview, he defended his decision, stating, \"Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent.  I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape.  It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.\"  [He also added that her death complicated the case](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/28/teacher-rape-montana/2722817/).\n\nIn 2019, a Tennessee Judge Steven Sword sentenced former pastor, David Richards, to 12 years in prison, 60 short of the maximum prosecutors had sought, for repeatedly having raped his adopted daughter over the course of two years, beginning when she was 14-years-old.  Richards maintained his innocence throughout trial, attempting to portray his victim as a rebellious teenager, who only made the allegations, after he had imposed strict rules for his children.  However, his DNA profile was lifted from a seminal fluid sample recovered from the girl's bed frame.\n\n[The judge, in handing down his lenient sentence, stated that he took into account Richard's longtime ministry, the Bible study he began in jail while awaiting trial, and the community support he received from family, friends, and fellow Christians](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/crime/2019/05/09/former-pastor-nets-12-year-prison-term-rape-adopted-daughter-david-lynn-richards/1143006001/).\n\nAt sentencing, over 30 friends and parishioners sat on Richard's side of the courtroom in support of him, while only six appeared for his victim.  One of those appearing on behalf of Richards to argue for sentencing leniency, David Thompson, who shared ministerial duties w/ Richards at their church, said, [\"I find it impossible for me to believe he's guilty of this. His business needs him. His family needs him. Our church needs him.\"](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/crime/2019/05/09/former-pastor-nets-12-year-prison-term-rape-adopted-daughter-david-lynn-richards/1143006001/)  Clearly, his family needs him, since he's such a wonderful father.\n\nAnd, of course, there's the new breed of vitriolic misogynists who, in a single breath, deny rape culture while proliferating it w/ their toxic ideology.  They refer to themselves as \"[Western chauvinists](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys),\" but in reality, [they're nothing but neo-Nazi terrorists](https://www.timesofisrael.com/not-nazi-enough-proud-boys-leader-wants-group-to-fully-embrace-white-supremacy/), and [that's all they've ever been](https://www.adl.org/blog/proud-boys-bigotry-is-on-full-display), so don't be fooled by their rhetoric.  They've now taken to wearing suits and ties and [holding yearly conventions that promise to make \"men masculine again,\" while \"Making Women Great Again.\"](https://the21convention.org/)  Since last year's conference was such disgrace, [this year's conference promises to be an even more hatefully misogynistic experience w/ 17 featured speakers, and in a first, they're actually going to allow to women to speak](https://22convention.com/)!\n\n>Women today are being taught to act more like men. Where has that led us? Skyrocketing rates of broken families, a documented decline in female happiness since the 1970s, endless social and dating dysfunction, and America at the #1 spot in the world for single motherhood. No longer will you have to give in to toxic bullying feminist dogma and go against your ancient, biological nature as a woman, great men and women have arrived to help #MWGA.\n\nIt's pretty clear that this toxicity has led to a rape culture that's just intolerable, and this is just a snapshot of what's taking place in America.  [Gender-based violence has rooted itself in some of the most populous countries in the world, and the problem only appears to be getting worse](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/southasiasource/understanding-rape-culture-in-bangladesh-india-pakistan/).  In other parts of the world, the abuse of women is absolutely horrific, [akin to something the Third Reich did to Jews in the death camps](https://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1233&context=history-in-the-making).  In 2016, an [Indian woman from the state of Rajasthan was gangraped by her husband and his two brothers](https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india-woman-gangraped-by-husband-in-laws-tattooed-with-expletives-over-dowry-336883), then tattooed across her forehead and hands/arms w/ expletives, b/c her family failed to meet the husband's dowry demands.  In 2018, [a 17-year-old Moroccan girl was abducted, tortured, and gangraped by 13 men over the course of two months](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/8/27/morocco-outcry-after-girl-is-raped-tattooed-with-swastikas).  They burned her w/ cigarettes and tattooed her all over her body, including w/ symbols of swastikas.\n\nThis could go on (and on and on and on and on), but there's only so much space available on the Internet.  What's clear is that those who perpetuate this violent culture are the same who propose and legislate the wholly ineffectual laws designed to deal w/ this problem, and they're also those who enforce, prosecute, and adjudicate said laws.  In a sense, it's allowing predators to sit in judgment of predators, while, at the same time, giving them the option to dismiss those they victimize.  I'd say that it's a broken system, except that it's not.  It's a system that's working exactly in the way in which it was intended.",

(A blue dress with sunflowers, gray cardigan and white keds). \n\nMy cardigan is a little big on me and slipped off my shoulder while I was bending down helping a kid. Another boy in class (10th grade, not SPED) saw this and started to make a small fuss about my bra strap being visible for like, 4 seconds.

My uncle has been working on this book for 5 years and self-published it recently. He sent Christmas cards out that urged his family and friends to read the book. So I did. \n\nThe entire book is conjecture. The man was found guilty of the rape by a jury and there is video evidence of him confessing. He failed a polygraph. My uncle has know the rapist since middle school and the rapist was his eye doctor as an adult. The rapist was found guilty of raping his mother in law, and the rapist’s children often came to school looking beaten up (reported by teachers). He defends the rapist stating, “he is a good man and I know he wouldn’t do this.” He has no evidence whatsoever. \n\nSome highlights from the book include:\n\n“One of the tragedies of the American justice system that has come to light since the advent of DNA testing is the number of men falsely convicted of rape on the basis of the victim’s eyewitness testimony.”\n\n“How could a woman emerging from a deep sleep and awakening to the shock of her son-in-law raping her have such a vivid memory of the scene?”\n\nParaphrasing- The mother in law waited a year to report the rape. The mother in law saw her rapist 4 times that year before she reported it. Therefore, she is lying about the rape itself because no one would continue seeing their rapist. \n\n“No one rapes their mother in law”\n\n“Men, when was the last time you entertained thoughts of carnal nature involving your wife’s mother?”\n\nThe whole thing is...horrifying to say the least. That my uncle would spend 5 years of his life writing such a book. That this is so important to him. Every time I think our country is making progress, I’m reminded of how terrible people are. ( I understand polygraphs aren’t reliable and there are forced confessions. I totally get how flawed our legal system is. I’m more commenting on how my uncle has poured such much time and energy defending this acquaintance of his, who has been found guilty, rather than feeling compassion for the victim). \n\nBELIEVE RAPE VICTIMS.",

    "text": "How old were you when you were first sexually harassed at school? This is the story of when I had to strip in front of two grown women to prove I was, in fact, starting puberty.\n\nI was in 4th grade. 9 years old. I had started puberty just before my 8th birthday. My boobs grew a TON my first year.\n\nA male teacher took me out of class during a movie and sat me down in the hallway. \"You don't have to, you know, *do that* to fit in. You'll develop breasts soon enough. Tomorrow when you come to school, I don't want to see you *doing that* or i'm going to have to send you to the principal and get your parents to come and talk to you.\"\n\nI had no idea what he meant. But to him I was playing dumb.\n\nSo I was escorted to the principle's office. Confused and terrified.  It just didn't make sense. What had I done wrong?\n\nThe principle and my teacher sat in her office for a couple of minutes. When she came out she told me to stand up. I did. They both looked me up and down. Then they asked various office staff to look at me as well. Discussion in her office ensued. Without me.\n\nI was finally brought in. Alone with the principal.\n\n\"You are such a good student and you have so many friends, Emily. But you don't have to try so hard to impress boys. Boys your age are so much less developed than you are. You don't have to ***stuff your bra*** to draw attention to yourself.\"\n\nI had no fucking clue what that meant. \"Stuff my bra?\"\n\n\"What you did this morning before coming to school? Or in the bathroom before class?\"\n\nI asked her why I would do something like that. She got frustrated. Now I was mad because I was being accused of something I never even thought existed.\n\nAfter some blubbering from me, she took me by the wrist and marched me to the nurse's office. \n\nThey closed the bathroom door and told me to take my shirt off.

I was sent home with a note telling my parents I should not wear any tight fitting clothes that accentuated my breasts, not to cause a distraction for classmates.\n\nI was deeply traumatized by this experience and is one of the reasons why I don't trust authority figures. This disgusting act opened my eyes to the fact that my breasts, at nine years old, were being sexualized. And I was threatened and punished for just having a woman's body.",

    "text": "I pursued a heavily quantitative job not because I wanted to, but because I wanted to prove I could be a woman with \"hard skills\". While I applaud women in STEM, I have learned that it's more important to applaud women who go unapologetically after WHATEVER career they WANT and feel confident in. I was 20 when I sat down across from my male college advisor in his office. It was the day I decided on my major, and I was nervously excited. I went into the conversation fully ready to narrow in my studies to my university's English department. My excitement, however, quickly dissipated as I sat there listening to the expert across from me talk through the downsides of my major of choice. He showed me career stats for the most recent graduating class. He pointed to my quant scores from the SAT and my performance in a difficult math course I took my Freshman year at the school. \"Are you sure you have thought this through?\" he asked me. \"You are unique with how left-brained you are - you could really thrive in a major that requires that\".\n\nI hesitated, but ultimately I didn't go with my gut. I signed my name under a major he recommended.\n\nI didn't internalize at that moment that I was signing onto something far more important than simply a major that I wasn't passionate about. I was signing onto what would escalate into a 9-year journey of forgoing what I really loved to do, in an attempt to prove myself as a competitive woman.\n\nI remember my family was really proud of me when I graduated with honors in such a \"difficult\" major.  They tried to compliment me by saying things like \"I can't believe you got through x courses\" or \"It makes us so proud seeing you as one of only a handful of women in the honors program for your major\". I remember my siblings were even more proud when I landed a highly quantitative job that came from passing interviews with complicated case studies.\n\nWhat they didn't see was that I was deeply unhappy. I was sleep deprived from 3 years of pushing myself to be competitive with my mostly male peers. Not tired because I was a woman and they were men. But tired because I didn't enjoy what I was learning and doing.\n\nWhen I am brutally honest with myself, I have lived in a state of constant stress when it comes to school and work basically since that day in my college advisor's office. I'd watch classmates, and then coworkers, light up when presented with a particularly large math problem to solve. While they lit up, I shut down. I dreaded school and dreaded work. I was an anxious bubble hovering right on the verge of implosion. I thought it was because I was not cut out for the increasing difficulty. In reality, I just wasn't doing what I loved. My skill I was most confident in was not relevant.\n\nMy favorite video I have of myself as a kid was the one where I proudly showed my parents that I had taught myself how to read out of my older sister's chapter book. I was in Kindergarten. I first felt extraordinary and understood when a high school English teacher pulled me aside after class and said that in thirty years of teaching Freshmen there, he had never read writing as unique and strong as mine. I was quiet, and awkward socially, but I knew I was an excellent writer. Writing became my outlet throughout high school.\n\nUnfortunately, most signs in the world outside of my childhood and time in high school directed me to reconsider the value of being a good writer. I feel confident that this was largely because I am a woman. I was told from seemingly every angle that to be a woman in finance or tech, especially in a highly analytical role, was the paradigm. It was a sure fire way to prove myself as not just equal to men, but potentially even *more capable.*\n\nIn this kind of cultural context, women are subtly directed that to be excellent and on-par with men, we must go out and prove people wrong who believe that men are \"better\" at math. We must shatter the glass ceiling in traditionally male industries. To be a woman who is decent at math and doesn't do that is to be a woman who isn't \"fulfilling her potential\". While I 100% support all women who love those fields and that way of working and thinking in their pursuit of exactly what they want, it wasn't the field I wanted to be in.\n\nDespite some random man telling me when I was 20 that I am \"left-brained\" as if that was some fact, the only fact was that he didn't know me. I did. I truly wish I could go back in time and say a big \"fuck you my brain isn't one-sided, my heart and most unique skill-set is with writing, and that is why I am going to major in English\".\n\nBut, I didn't. Instead, I deeply internalized in that moment a truth that the right side of my brain was - to others - less valuable than the left.\n\nSo. To women who are excellent writers who love story-telling (or who love anything that involves a \"soft\" skill that \"anyone can do\" and rarely \"leads to a high paying job\") please don't listen to the noise. Celebrate young women who love math and will happily kill it in STEM careers. Celebrate young women who love children and learning and want to be kick-ass teachers. Celebrate young women who care passionately about any social topic who could be change-driving activists. Celebrate young women who are opinionated and incredible public speakers who may go on to run a country some day.\n\nMost importantly, go after exactly what you want to study or do professionally without hesitation. Don't let outside noise or expectations drive your decisions. I did. Have I failed miserably? No of course not. I've actually done well based on my job's standards. We are all more capable than we give ourselves credit for. But, I don't enjoy it. It's taken me quite a few years to understand that it doesn't matter what industry I am in or what high profile job I am doing every day. I won't ever shatter a glass ceiling so long as I don't feel *personally* confident and deeply in touch with what I am doing and what value I am adding. Personally, I believe I need to be writing every single day to do that.\n\nSoft skills shouldn't be looked down upon or associated with any one gender. Neither should hard, quantitative skills. Both matter. What matters more is understanding what you love and why, and trusting your gut with going after something with passion. Writing is my spark. I encourage you to identify yours and bring it to life through your studies and career choices.\n\nedit: a commenter made an excellent point that saying that quantitative skills are needed for a career in the STEM field is a generalization that isn't accurate. Many skills are relevant to a fulfilling career in STEM!",

    "text": "I am so sick of people putting all blame on the mother when it comes to difficult family situations! First off all I (F24)am not a mother but my sister(28) is a mother of four and the things she is being put through that I have  witnessed just grind my gears! \n\nFor context my sister is currently in the process of getting out of a toxic relationship. It's  messy and a slow process.  But the abridged version is,  she got married to a guy from a very religious  household who pressured her into becoming  a mother early and kept pressuring her for more kids. Her (still)husband still wants more kids but doesn't care for the already born ones (for him caring for children boils down to scream at them till they finally  do as he says). Result  is that the oldest two show early signs of childhood trauma,  social services are involved and my sister is struggling to build an independent existence so she can get a divorce. \n\nWhat just ticks me off is that everyone expects her to pull the whole stunt off. \n\nThe flat  looks like a dumpster and the husband doesn't  leave enough money for food in the bank account?  Well she  needs to manage the household better.  She is the problem because she is an unfit mother. It's not the husband that spends money on unnecessary stuff and locks the goverment child support  money from her for his expenses. It's her the mother being lazy for not getting the dishes done while caring for four children all under the age of 7 not him sleeping or gaming most of the time. \n\nThe child shows signs of mental trauma and is already seeing a child psychiatrist and talking to social services but still makes trouble in school?  Well she the mother gets belittled by the teacher and principal even tho they are fully aware of the family situation and give the father a pass for being the \"bread-winner\". My sister holds down two jobs and is building her own bussines  but the man with one job and three days off of work a week that he spends gaming or drinking with friends is good to go.It's the mother that is soley  responsible for the bad behavior. \n\nOn regular check up visits with social workers she got told  that : \n1. She needs to renovate  the flat \n2. Her renovations  she did all on her own in one week aren't good enough \n3. She should ignore her diploma in agriculture economics and stop persuing  building her own bussines because \"she needs to acknowledge the insecurities of her husband\"\n4. She needs to be more understanding  for the needs of her husband\n5. She needs to stay with her husband for the kids sake\n6. She should just leave the kids with our mother or me not even acknowledging that our mother as well as I have seperat lifes and our own occupations and in the case of me even live a 45 minute drive  away. \n7. She needs to sell her bussines assets (livestock and horses)  while her husband has multiple unused cars and other motorized expensive  and unused equipment as well as tons of limit edition gameing equipment and fanmerch that could be liquidated and that the kids aren't emotionally  attached to. \n8. The fact that she gets help from other women for cleaning  and cooking is making er less of a mother figure. \n\nIn no moment  was it ever acknowledge that the husband is also a factor  in the equation. His behavior which in parts actively prevents my sister  from fulfilling the demands the social services have for her is completely excused  and socially acceptable. It is the mother she has to make everything right! \n\nThe expectations society  places on mothers just because they are mothers are just rediculous. It seems mothers are expected to just strip themselves of all rights of individuality and become solely responsible  for the kids even if a other parental figure  is involved. If mothers struggle,  they get blamed for struggling in the first  place. \n\nAs woman who doesn't  even want kids this just breaks my heart. Why can't we just give mothers a break and respect what they achieve and give them the support  they need?",

    "text": "I'm tired of us ignoring some of the genuine reasons many women get STIs that have nothing to do with being \"dumb\" or \"careless\" This is kind of a rant, but I'm seeing a pattern of STIs in women with male partners that I feel like we don't talk about or acknowledge.\n\nI work in sexual health. So I see a ton of people in my clinic with STIs. Many women with male sex partners do not come in with STIs bc the are \"careless\" or \"dumb\" or \"slutty\". In fact, women with a higher number of sexual partners, often take sexual health more seriously than others. Sex workers, highkey have the best safe sex practices.\n\nI feel like we are dishonest about what is really fueling so many of the STIs in women with male partners. SOOOO many of the women I see felt uncomfortable forcing a man to get an STI test before sleeping with him. Or they believed a man verbally saying he was tested, instead of demanding official paperwork (shocker some men lie about their results or when they got tested). some women were too scared or uncomfortable to demand a man use a condom.\n\n(I have literally had to teach teen girls how to say no to men who refuse to use condoms because none of their sex-ed teachers ever bothered to mention that critical aspect of sexual health to them.)\n\nThe vast majority of my HIV positive women I see got it from a monogamous partner who either cheated on them or withheld their HIV positive status from them.  I just had a woman get HIV from the only man she'd been with for the past five years and I just feel bad because she did nothing wrong and it never occurred to her she'd be at risk - but women in monogamous relationships still have STI risks. I've seen married women discover they had an STI because they were struggling with getting pregnant, but hadn't got an STI test since the start of their relationship, and their male partner had unfortunately been unfaithful to them at some point. (Fun fact some STIs are silent killers, you can't necessarily \"feel\" every STI)\n\nI feel like we just tell women \"use condoms\" and \"get tested\" for safe sex, but that's literally scratching the surface because it doesn't acknowledge many of the genuine cases that cause so many women to not feel educated  or strong or confident or comfortable enough to press for safe sex in risky situations. \n\nWhy aren't we teaching hetero women how to say no to men who refuse to use condoms? To say no to men who refuse to get up-to-date STI testing (no a test from 6 months isn't good enough)? That's its not being untrusting to demand to see STI results in official paperwork and not accept word of mouth? To know that sadly infidelity happens so even in monogamous relationships/marriage you still need to get STI tested yearly with your doctor? To tell their male partners that if they ever are unfaithful to tell you ASAP to get tested to prevent possible health risks? \n\nI just feel like we aren't being honest about the education and empowerment needed to actually help women practice safer sex - because giving free condoms is not enough to stop women from getting STIs.\n\nP.S. I'm not trying to be heternormative, it's just the vast majority of women I see with STIs are having sex with men",

    "text": "My Diploma is Her Revenge I need a moment to rant and to criticize some people who have openly threatened my life in the past, hence, throwaway account.\n\nSo, anyway: before my last relationship ended, when I was still in the closet, I was part of a student religious association at my university and the people I met there were basically my entire social circle. Over the course of four years, I watched normal, well-intentioned people be sucked into a religious movement called Radical Traditionalism.\n\nI don't want to get too deep into the details. Suffice it to say that Radical Traditionalism is a controversial religious movement whose defining religious belief is that a return to all social norms which existed before the birth of Karl Marx, including but not limited to traditional gender roles, is necessary in order to save us from an impending apocalypse.\n\nSo...I was a closeted lesbian and a female engineer, forced to slowly watch my friends and family be sucked into this madness, while I was their easiest target for regurgitating angry propaganda and threats.\n\nI was a high school debate captain and I can handle myself in an argument, so, at first, I would just fire back when these zealots would start calling me a sinner. But things just got worse and worse. I found myself the only person arguing against a room full of twelve other people (led by another female engineering student), who claimed that the downfall of America began with the passage of the 19th Amendment.\n\nI pointed out to this woman that I knew she voted: she was a pro-life protestor, she marched on Washington multiple times, and a staunch Republican organizer. Her response was that she had no choice but to vote if the government allowed her to vote, but that she wished the government did not allow her.\n\nTheir argument was that if there were no women voters, there would not be liberals and that none of the \"progressive\" legislation of the 20th century could have got through Congress.\n\nSomehow, this topic got onto education and how women either don't need or shouldn't have college educations, which was an absurd conversation to have with other female engineering students at a large public university. They decried the fact that they were FORCED to attend school by a society which doesn't take care of its women anymore but that one REALLY got to me.\n\nWhen my great-grandmother was born, American women could not vote. I still remember her. Her life is not in the distant past. But both of my grandmothers are still alive, and neither of them completed high school. My American grandmother never graduated because the school refused to let a disabled woman even turn in homework or take exams. She sat through class every day and completed all her homework assignments, only to watch the teachers throw her work in the garbage without reading it. Every. Damn. Day.\n\nMy Irish grandmother never graduated high school because her family needed her to work--so she took a job as a priest's secretary. This priest was a professor at a college which did not admit women. \n\nAnd that insult still stings in my chest. I am their revenge. My diploma is their revenge. \n\nThere is no moment of revenge like four elderly Irish women pulling out their savings from a lifetime of being secretaries and nurses and bank tellers and assembly-line workers, a lifetime of being paid less than men for the same work, by the Catholic Church, by the NHS, by American corporations--to buy textbooks so that an American teenager could become an engineer.\n\nAnd to see these students--secure in their college funding and their citizenships and their civil liberties--start complaining about the burden of opportunity: That broke me inside.\n\nAnd it broke me again and again to watch them drop out to pursue this movement: brilliant physicists, neuroscientists, chemists--it still hurts, wondering that's become of them. Wondering if they're free to call for help if they're being abused. Wondering if they're happy.\n\nI miss them. I am angry at them. I am worried for them.\n\nBut I did not follow them.

My self and another women in my program have been dealing with some pretty intense harassment from a male student for the entire school year. It's always made me uncomfortable, but in the past month it has moved well past that and officially into the realm of feeling unsafe both on and off campus. \n\nThis male student has become erratic, confrontational, and increasingly unpredictable; as well as going out of his way to tell other males in the program how much he dislikes and distrusts women. There are only two female students and one female teacher in my program, and each of us have come forward to say that he makes us feel unsafe. \n\nAfter spending over an hour explaining how this is not only making me feel like I am in physical danger, but also taking a heavy toll on my educational career I asked how the situation was going to be handled moving forward. I was shocked to learn that none of our identities will be protected in anyway when the man is confronted- apparently our safety is not as important as this being handled \"fairly and transparently\". So if he asks who reported him, they will just give him our names... Not that it would have been hard to guess as there's only 3 women in the program, but what the fuck?!?\n\nSo basically my choices are:\n\n1. Continue to be harassed by someone who doesn't even treat me like a person while my grades slowly deteriorate as I am so uncomfortable I can't even focus, let alone learn.\n\nOr...\n\n2. Have my name given to an unstable man (who I am physically afraid of) as the person who reported him while he is being informed that he's being suspended or expelled from school for gender-based harassment.\n\n\nThis sucks. I love my field of study; it's a very niche program and one of only a couple in the country so it's not like I can continue this with out relocating (not an option for me). I'm a straight A student and have an awesome internship lined up for this summer as well as a exciting future to look forward to. I feel like my education is being put on the line just so some asshole can continue to treat me like shit everyday.\n\nI have talked with the other woman and we have decided if the school refuses to protect our identities or try to keep us safe we will be calling the police to get a no contact order. I will literally have an officer come onto campus and present the order to admissions if I have to. \n\nI'm fluctuating between being so angry I could scream and so sad I want to cry.

    "text": "I got accepted into the master's program of my dreams! I'm so happy and I want to share this achievement with all of you because you all had given me the strength to continue and never give up. Reading your stories had made me feel understood, there are no words I can say to thank you enough. I have learned through your words how to respect myself and how to not revictimize myself. I want to share my story in case someone can relate, if I could get out of the darkness, you can too!\n\nTW: sexual assault, abortion, suicidal ideation\n\n\n2019 was one of the most difficult years of my life. I was in a very toxic relationship with a serial cheater and abuser. I lost myself completely, I lost my voice, my willing and back then, I thought I had lost my worth too. He was agressive in every way, he used his strength as a krav maga instructor against me and fear was a constant feeling. He ended up raping me and hitting me. I got pregnant and had to get an abortion. All of that was extremely traumatizing to say the least. I don't know how I survived all that, but I did and left that \"relationship\". \n\nIt was hard. Not because I loved him, no. But because I didn't love ME. I thought I didn't deserve anything better. I felt guilty and stupid. I have depression and anxiety and they reached a peak at that time. I caught myself in a destructuve cycle of pity, anger, fear and hollowness. I was suicidal.\n\nAnd then 2020, the pandemic hit. I isolated myself. I've never had lots of friends but this was a new level of loneliness. I had just finish my bachelor's, I was broke and unemployed and feeling my life was paralyzed. I've always felt I'm behind in life because I couldn't follow \"the plan\". I finished my degree at 29 and I'm still living with my parents. I didn't choose it to be that way, I'm not lazy, but my life had other plans for me. Anyways, one of my life dreams is to have an academic career, I want to have a Master's and a PHD, I want to be a reseacher and a teacher. But I felt stuck and didn't pursued those dreams, didn't apply for any program. \n\nI was trying to heal and got briefly into therapy. It helped me for a while, but my therapist pressured me into report my abuser and press charges. I didn't want to. I didn't have the mental and emotional strength to go through that process, I didn't even have the money to get a lawyer, and even more when I'm in a third world country in which rape culture is normalized, 85% of rape acussations don't get a closure and 11 women are killed everyday without anyone blinking an eye. And I felt (and still feel) guilty for not \"doing my part\", I don't want any other woman to live what I did, I don't want him to hurt anyone else. But I really couldn't, I just wanted to heal and take my life back, I was so down everyday I thought about kms. \n\nEven tho I had blocked him, he made sure to let me know he got accepted into a (different) Master's program of our Uni and that he was excited to see me again. I was paranoid and scared, I don't want to see him ever again. \n\nMeanwhile I got close to a friend I hadn't seen for years. He listened to me and was there for me through my healing process. I didn't know how much I needed someone to be compassionate with me because back then I didn't know how to do that for myself. He was patient, never judged me, never pressured me. We started a relationship and I think he taught me how to love myself, how to respect myself. I truly love him with all my heart, this is the best relationship I've ever had and for the first time I'm not codependent. He showed me another life is possible, a beautiful one in which fear is not the dominant feeling, but tranquility. I feel content. \n\nHe motivated me to apply to a program in another Uni, a program I've always dreamed of but seemed impossible for me to get in. And after 6 months of tests and waiting, yesterday they told me I'm in. Guys....I'M IN!! I did it!! Me, the same woman that didn't see a future for herself.\n\nWell, I guess I'm not the same woman. I've grown and healed and will continue to do so. Some things still hurt, but I'm so much better right now. I didn't imagine I could have this life. Back then everything seemed so dark and asphyxiating, back then I thought that was the end. But my life is only starting, now I understand it's never late.\n\nI will find another therapist to treat my anxiety and my insecurities. I will be fine, as I am now. \n\nIf you are going through a hard time, please know that you are not alone. I don't want to be that person that says it always gets better, I know that in a depressive state that can sound condescending. But I will say that the future can hold plenty of bad things, but definitely has all the good ones. Uncertainty has all the opportunities and progress and we are stronger than we think.\n\nThank you for reading me, I hope this resonates with someone out there.",

    "text": "Thoughts on FMLA The subject of FMLA came up at work recently where people were talking about how some of our co-workers are abusing it.  If I had to bet, I would say that some people do take advantage of it.  It sucks that it seems like the same few co-workers seem to always be taking off, leaving us short and nothing can be done about it.  Some of my co-workers even advocate doing away with it altogether.  \n\nI could not disagree with that sentiment more.  It's one of the very few rights we workers have.  Prior to that law being passed a woman could be fired for going out on maternity leave.  If you had a sick parent and needed to take some time off you had no job protection.  \n\nIn the 70's my mom who was a teacher at the time was pregnant and asked to take 2 weeks off.  Her boss gave her 1 week off instead.  My little sister was born with CF.  My mom was eventually given the choice of resigning or getting fired when she needed more time off to take care of her.  Then my dad was fired by his company because they heard how sick my sister was and were afraid of how much their employer provided health insurance would go up.  That was the actual reason he was given for his termination.   \n\nWhen something is given there will always be people who abuse the spirit of the law by taking advantage of the letter of the law.  But those job protection that benefit them can also benefit you.  That's my I don't grumble too much when we are short staffed.",

    "text": "Tell me about your first nursing job. Today I have thought about my first nursing job more than a few times. I have this urge to send an email to nursing education and follow up. It means so much to me to not ever allow another new nurse have the same orientation process I did. I had 15 different preceptors/teachers in a 16 week period and it was awful.  My preceptors would tell me I'm doing great then tell my managers otherwise. I would have one nurse show me how to do something and a different nurse tell me I was wrong for doing it that way. For example, when looking up iv compatibility you'll have a red, yellow, and green symbol. For two iv fluids to be ran at the same time the symbol has to be green. The first nurse to look up compatibility with me told me that the fluids were ok to be ran together when the symbol was yellow. Yellow Meaning unsure if the fluids were safe. Different nurse,same meds, said we need to stop the fluids now and told me the other nurse and I performed an experiment. My preceptor that day was also a charge nurse on the unit and was super knowledgeable. I had one nurse go and tell my manager that I was more worried about a guy's headache rather than the fact that he just came into the hospital for a MI because I was asking which pain med was better to give him for his headache. The guy was on a nitro gtt that dilated his vessels and was causing his headache. I asked if Norco would be best because the other option was morphine. Morphine is also a vasodilator. I had already done this guys assessment and focused more on cardiopulmonary systems before asking my preceptor about the norco. My heart attack guy was stable and priority tx had already been initiated. Same nurse said I spent too much time doing my assessments and this can make a client feel uncomfortable(this comment was made towards the end of my orientation) and resulted in the nurse educator following me around assessing my assessments . I felt so incompetent and she didn't say much about my assessment. Only to spend less time in the room and do the assessment first before meds. Almost all 15 nurses I followed gave meds first. To this day I still do assessment then meds though. The nurse educator... seriously this woman probably celebrated when I was let go. She tried to say I gave a pain med when it wasn't scheduled. Found out it was scheduled(went as far as calling pharmacy just to clarify) but still needed to give me a hard time about something. So she told me that I shouldn't blame my preceptor if I may have made a mistake (I don't remember her exact wording) when I didn't blame anyone for anything. I told her my preceptor and I doubled checked the meds together before giving them. I even scanned the med AND patient before giving it. You know, doing what I'm supposed to do. Another time she took off out of a room when I needed help getting someone on a commode and knew I needed help because I said I did. She even grabbed the commode and put it by the client. Told me Joint commission doesn't want nurses doing med calculations, I emailed Joint commission and they stated in some nursing settings they prefer us to do med calculations and don't mind if we do them. The first unprofessional thing my nurse educator did though was tell my preceptor in front of a group of nurses how illogical I was because I asked her why she wasn't wearing a face mask in the break room(this happened my 2nd or 3rd week on orientation and it was the beginning of covid). Out of everything this hurt the most.  For 13 more weeks I dreaded going to work and feeling like nursing was the wrong choice. I went to nurse education and tried to get help and out of no where just started crying. She thought I was joking when I told her I had 15 preceptors. My nurse manager and educator told me that I had so many because each nurse on the floor had a strength to teach and they wanted me to become my own individual. No other new hire on my floor had this issue. 16 weeks later I was let go mid shift, signed a discharged paper that I never should have signed. I wrote nurse education a long email about my experience and couldn't stress enough that I wasn't writing the email out of despite. I was told they were going to look into it. Over a year later and I find myself pondering if they really looked into it. \nI did go on to flourish on a critical Care floor and even taught nursing students. I will not ever pretend like I'm a better nurse, put someone down due to lack of experience, and try my hardest to not make you feel uncomfortable as a new nurse. \nI'm sorry for the rant but it feels so good to get it out!",

    "text": "getting through school while helping care for terminally ill parent i thought about posting this in the nursing student subreddit but i’d like to hear from some people who got through school and graduated already so i decided to post in here first. basically what the title says, how did you get through school while going through something terrible? \n\ni started a BSN program January of 2021. just a few months prior, in October of 2020, my mom was diagnosed with brain cancer. unfortunately it turned out to be glioblastoma & within just a few months, my family’s life is totally different. my mom has had it rough. she went from being a perfectly fit woman with no health conditions except allergies to unable to drive, unable to feed herself, incontinence, cognitive decline, some seizures, trouble swallowing, etc. i read about how horrible glioblastoma could be and quickly saw my moms health start to diminish. it has been so heartbreaking. \n\ni don’t know how to do this all. i work full time (i have to, my job is helping pay for my school & i need the money), so i started school last semester part time. when i go back next week i will technically be finishing my first semester classes but it will be my second semester of nursing school. i did okay last semester. i want to do well and graduate but i feel so horrible about everything going on. it takes me 1 1/2 hour to commute to my school. i would listen to lectures during the drive and im allowed to wear headphones while i work so id also play lectures as i work. i found that to be helpful but my grades weren’t as good as i wanted them to be. i also worked with my teachers individually and a tutor. the school is aware of my mom. \n\nlast semester it was so exhausting. i work 4pm-12:30am so it sucks when i have class early in the morning. i’d only get 3-4 hours of sleep. i can’t do anything about my hours or my work schedule, i need the tuition help. when i’d get back in town from school, id go see my mom for as long as i can before i had to go to work. i have lost so much weight, i eat once a day and i haven’t been taking care of myself because i am in a terrible mindset. ive talked to counselors and therapists, taken medication, but nothing helps. \n\ni need to get it together this week. i start again on Monday and im so nervous. i could take a leave from school for up to a year but im so torn, because maybe my mom will outlive her prognosis and she could see me graduate. although i see my mom in between school & work, & spend 95% of my free time with her, it never is enough. its like ive developed separation anxiety. i want to be with her every second. even if i spend hours there, im already sad as im backing out of the driveway to leave. its hard to concentrate. im moody and i cry a lot and i feel like no one understands me. i didn’t make any nursing school friends last semester, i sat alone in class and i just feel lonely. \n\nhow did you make it through school while helping care for an ill parent or experiencing a life changing loss? its now been 1 year since my moms symptoms started appearing & i honestly feel like ive lost my mind. im depressed & life just isn’t the same anymore. i want to make it through school, i want my mom to see me graduate & i don’t want to fail. i wasn’t an A student last semester but i also wasn’t a D/F student either. i did fail 1 exam but i also aced 1 exam. did average on the rest. ended with Bs & C’s. im scared about starting my clinicals. im worried about not being as smart or prepared as everyone else. \n\nim sorry this was so long. this is not the nursing school experience i was supposed to have. i would literally give my mom my brain if i could. i would do anything for her to be well. im trying to be a good daughter and good student and good worker. i want to be in school, my mom & dad want me in school, but i also want to take the leave of absence. i dont know what to do. i greatly appreciate any advice.",

    "text": "Yesterday's Excellent Parent Meeting Yesterday, just as the school day was about to end, I got a phone call from the front office.\n\n\"Jack's [fake name] mother is coming to meet with you. She didn't really ask, she just said she'd be here at 1:20. She was really angry on the phone, so the principal will sit in. You can meet in her office.\"\n\nThis is odd, because I've had a few phone calls with Jack's mom, and they've all been pleasant. I can't think of anything that's happened which might have made her angry, but I guess I'll find out at the meeting.\n\nSo, I head up to the office a few minutes before this parent is supposed to stop in. Ten minutes go by. Twenty. Finally, I tell the principal, \"Well, I'm going to go. I think we've waited a long enough time.\"\n\nThe principal says that's fine, she'll be around anyway, and if the parent comes in, she will handle it and let me know what is said.\n\nAs I'm walking out, the phone rings. \"I'm five minutes away! Don't let the teacher leave!\" I can actually hear her because she's shouting into the phone. The secretary says, \"Well, let me check that she's still here.\" I shrug and walk back into the principles office. \"She's here,\" says the secretary.\n\nMaybe 10 minutes later, the parent arrives. She is definitely angry, and the principal has to step out of the office to tell her to stop yelling at the secretary if she wants this meeting to happen. The mom calms down and comes back into the office.\n\nWe don't even exchange pleasantries, and she's off again. Yelling about a project he did and got a bad grade on that she doesn't agree with. I can't get a word in edgewise, but I have no idea what she's talking about. I haven't assigned a project. \n\nThe principal interjects again, \"Ma'am, if you continue to raise your voice, I'll have to ask you to leave. We are happy to meet with you, but not if you're going to be yelling.\"\n\nI take the opportunity to say, \"I'm sorry, but I didn't assign a project this trimester. Is it the project they did with the computer teacher? The one about animals?\"\n\n\"No! It was about George Washington! And he worked very hard, and I double checked all his work, and he definitely should have got more than 6 points!\"\n\nI assure her that I didn't give a project like that, and I offer to pull out my laptop so we can go over his grade book together. As I'm doing so, she starts going off again.\n\n\"And I need you to explain to me exactly what you wrote in the notes on his progress report!\" She pulls a paper out of her purse and is waving it in my face. I am now even more confused, because I never gave Jack a progress report. He didn't need one; his grades are fine.\n\nShe slaps the paper down on the table. I point.\n\n\"That's not my signature.\"\n\n\"You're just saying that because your principal is here! Don't try to get out of it!\"\n\n\"Ma'am, that's not even my *name.*\" I'm looking at my principal now, because I am absolutely baffled.\n\n\"What was your son's name, again?\" the principal asks.\n\n\"Jack! You know his name, I don't know why that's relevant!\"\n\n\"And his last name?\"\n\n\"Jackson!\"\n\nI am holding in either tears or laughter at this point, I'm not sure which. \"That's not my student. He's not in my class.\"\n\nThe mom goes off again, \"Well, he's in *somebody's* class! I want that teacher in here NOW!\"\n\nThe secretary punches \"Jack Jackson\" and the grade level into the system to figure out who his teacher is.\n\nHe doesn't go to our school. He's enrolled down the street and around the corner. \n\nThe mom called us for a meeting, not knowing who her son's teacher was (or what school he goes to, apparently), and told the secretary that his name was Jack and he was with a woman teacher whose name she didn't know in the second grade. I'm the only second grade teacher with a \"Jack\" in class. So they set her up a meeting with me. I've never seen my Jack (or his mother) in person, so I had no way of knowing any better.\n\nThe woman yelled about *our* incompetence the whole way out the door.",

    "text": "Crazy Parent admitted to being out to get me fired and it isn’t working About a month ago, I was verbally attacked by a crazy mom over every detail about me she could. This happened after a parent meeting where she screamed at us because her kid is a little shit and refuses to work. Our team is not the handholding type at all and our admin are incredibly supportive (important detail). \n\nAnyways, the other teachers had to go to a class and she asked me to stay. My VP and the councilor immediately came back into the room. This woman went off on my “lack of professionalism” and the fact I have policies and procedures I refuse to exempt her kid from. Then, she went after my relationships with students (my students love me) and my appearance. At that point, VP cut her off and basically said that she could not attack me like this and there would be an e-mail headed her way about how she would be allowed to proceed any communication with me. Crazy lady laughed and said “we will see about that.” After she left, I was pulled into the councilor’s office and allowed to have a breakdown and praised by admin for how I handled that as a 2nd year teacher. My principal was out with COVID, but we called her and explained the situation. Apparently, lady had already tried to contact the superintendent about me. \n\nCrazy mom was emailed a plan where she cannot speak with me in person without admin and a second teacher present and admin will be CC into every email. My team literally has been lifesavers and are on board with this whole thing.\n\nNow to last week: I am at a gas station and being the millennial I am I am listening to and singing along with T-Swift. I sang out loud the line “fuck the patriarchy” not thinking anything of it. Kid of crazy mom comes up to me the next day and says “My mom caught you on video at the gas station saying the f-word and we are sending it to the superintendent.” I knew in an instant what he was talking about. Went to my VP who doubled over laughing. She called the Assistant Superintendent and he laughed as well. Apparently lady had taken the day off to smugly sit in his office and asked I get fired over this video. He informed her that the district will encourage me to get a no contact order if she ever films me in public again. \n\nY’all, this is all nuts and it is over the fact I have policies and standards and refuse to budge for a kid who is capable but entitled. There will probably be more to this, but damn this was a good laugh at this point.\n\nUpdate: I can’t get a restraining order at this time. The gas station is right near my school and it was right after school so it very could have been a coincidence. Student is most likely being moved schools, so as of now we are keeping him in my class until we have more information on that. Also, my VP was my teacher mentor last year so she and I have a great relationship which definitely makes this easier to go through. I also live 45 minutes from my school, so I am not worried about running into her near my home.",

    "text": "I DID THE THING I've been trying to get a job in a public school for about 4 years...after working one year as a substitute and two years at a charter, I finally got an offer to be a first-grade teacher in a small district near my house! I'm super excited that I got the offer this early and don't have to spend my summer job searching (I may even have the opportunity to work during their summer school).\n\nI applied to the district last year but they decided not to fill the opening. They kept my application though, so they called me when they had another opening, so I didn't even have to apply. The interview went great, it was the first interview where I didn't feel like a nervous wreck. The principal was making jokes and was super friendly and keeps saying how excited she is to have me.\n\nThe school is super small and rural. There was a field of cows right next to the school, and on my way home from meeting the superintendent yesterday, I saw a woman walking a baby pig on a leash, lol. The entire district only has about 850 students, and the elementary only has 3 classes per grade level with really small class sizes. I'm super excited to be part of a really close-knit community.\n\nI can't believe it finally happened. So excited!!!!!! What can I do now to help me prepare for when school starts in August? My first year was pandemic teaching and I got the position in the middle of the year, after someone resigned, so I'm not sure what to expect or prepare. A lot of things were already set up for me.\n\nGood luck to everyone out there applying!",

    "text": "You Went To The University Of What? I am going on vacation next week, but had an interview yesterday that I'd thought I'd share. I like to think of it as a warning for teachers, prospective teachers, and administration.\n\nSo, a week or so ago, a parent of one of our students ran up to me after school as I was on my way to an IEP meeting. She asked if I had a few minutes and I told her I had about 90 seconds. I told her she could talk to me if she could walk with me towards my destination. She agreed. She then asked if it was true that one of my science teachers was retiring to which I told her that it was true. The teacher told her students last week so it wasn't a secret. \n\nThe mother asked if the position had been filed yet and I told her that we were still interviewing and then asked her if she was asking because she was interested. She told me know, but that her sister was looking for a teaching position but was struggling to find work. She told me that her sister had several degrees and that the mother would consider it a personal favor if I would interview her sister. \n\nNow normally, I'd just tell her to have her sister apply with the district and that I would keep an eye out for her resume, but this mother is a very nice woman who volunteers a lot with school dances, sporting events, and the school carnival. I told her that if her sister came by the next week on Thursday at 4, that I would talk to her. I told her it wouldn't be an official interview, but if she looked good as a candidate, then I would pitch her to HR, but no promises. \n\nSo, sure enough the candidate showed up. Lets call her Ms. False. Ms. False was prompt, well dressed, and very polite. When I sat with her, I let her know that this was not a formal interview, but an informal  one. I looked at her resume and asked her my normal questions. She told me that she had applied all over the state but had not received a single interview request. About 5 minutes into out chat though, I noticed that she had a lot of college degrees all from the same college, Concordia College and University of Delaware.\n\nBachelor's Degree in Elementary Education\n\nBachelor's Degree in Biology \n\nBachelor's Degree in Social Work\n\nBachelor's Degree in Computer Sciences\n\nMaster's Degree in Elementary Education\n\nMaster's Degree in Biology\n\nI looked at the degrees and at the applicant. 6 degrees and she was only 25 years old. I also looked at the dates she \"earned\" the degrees. All over a period of a year. I'm not an expert on colleges, but earning 6 degrees in a year seemed unlikely. So I asked her about her college experience and she listed off her degrees.  I asked her how she earned all those so fast and she explained how she was given credit for her \"life experience\" and then took some additional courses and tests. \n\nI asked her for a minute and I left my office and looked up the \"college\". Concordia College and University of Delaware is a diploma mill. You pay them something like $300 per degree. You tell them what you \"experience\" is and you buy a corresponding degree. So you could list working at McDonald's for 6 months and get an MBA if you pay them the fees.\n\nI returned to the office and explained that I couldn't recommend her to HR because her degree's didn't come from an accredited that the state or school district would recognize. She got frustrated and told me that traditional college isn't for everyone and that she knew the material, but didn't want to waste her time or money at a traditional college. I explained that I understand that there are alternatives, but that few school districts would hire someone who bought their degree from a degree mill.\n\nShe seemed to take offense at that term and left my office. This morning, the parent called me and asked what happened because her sister seemed pissed off after the interview but would say why. I told her that it wasn't my place to sy anything , but that she might want to look into the college her sister attended. \n\nLet this be a lesson for anyone looking for a college degree. Even though college can be long, tedious, and expensive, that is no reason to buy a degree and try to pass it off as legitimate. In this modern world, it is easy to see if a college is left or not. I even found a news report from a Canadian news group where they outed people with similar degrees that were working as professors, therapists, and more and most of those people lost their positions once the truth was exposed.",

    "text": "The Beginning of the End? So Admin is starting to panic because we have six teachers who have announced they will not be returning after break and they haven't filled half of those spots yet. So today we found out we might be losing another half dozen or so teachers. \n\nThe guy they have teaching Foods I (ie baking) has never even made muffins in his life. He is so overwhelmed because he is NOT a baker and is spending all weekend (at his own expense) baking trying to figure out what to do, but he can't get them to make anything because the class is 44 mins long and baking anything takes longer than that. We only have a single high school in our district, and he was given no help or support with the curriculum, and the woman that taught the class previously was so attacked and alienated by admin she took all her curriculum with her.\n\nWe have three programming classes. There is one math teacher who took a computational math class so they asked her to teach those classes, she agreed to teach one class every other year. They tried to force her and she went to the union, who backed her. So they have some sub forced into teaching the class and she has never programmed before. She is desperately trying to stay ahead of the class and they are one semester in and haven't really gotten anything accomplished. I offered to teach one of the classes, but \"YoU aRe NoT a MaTh TeAcHeR!\" I'm only a computational physicist with a certification in computer science, but w/e. They also legit couldn't find anyone who is qualified to teach my other class, if I took on a programming class.\n\nTwo of the CTE teachers are fed up. Apparently, Dr Bitchass (our AsstPrincipal of Instruction) made some kind of comment about how those \"weren't real subjects.\" So one is like 99% sure she is leaving, she has been interviewing at a district with more money.\n\nOne of our history teachers (who coaches cheerleading), got into some trouble in 2019 when they entire cheer squad was caught smoking weed in the locker room after a meet. She has been on the edge of quitting for a couple of years. Of course, they totally laid the blame at her feet, and she LIVED for cheer and they wouldn't let her continue as coach.\n\nAnd I have a third interview tonight. It's a great job, square in my wheelhouse, and the salary is about 3.5x what I'm making teaching.\n\nWe are at the point that the environment is so toxic, that the people who are on the fence are SERIOUSLY considering leaving. The people that were content are now beginning to wonder if they shouldn't leave. The more people that they force out, the more things get stressful and the more pressure they put on the remaining teachers. Every class is already, basically, full. Most classes don't have an empty desk in them. What are they going to do when there are, literally, not enough teachers to teach? I'm wondering if we aren't on the cusp of some great revolution.",

    "text": "I am so lost but have narrowed my options down to elementary school teacher, speech pathologist, school psychologist, or ultrasound tech. Can anyone give me some insight into any of these fields? I am a 24 year old woman and have a bachelors degree in anthropology (specializing in archaeology), with a minor in economics. I have been working as a legal secretary for the past two years for one of the best lawyers in the country. I have always been pushed towards law school, but I'm now seeing how little I'm actually interested in it. I have taken the LSAT twice and worked in law firms for the past 5 years (all through college). My dad was a lawyer, and I feel like I've been given so many wonderful opportunities to jump into the career, but I'm always told how stressful the work is. \n\nA significant factor in deciding my career path is that I would like to be able to stay home with my kids once I start a family. I currently have no debt from undergrad, and I am very afraid of taking on a lot of debt for a career I may not care for. I'm trying to be rational because I genuinely don't know what I enjoy or what my skills are. \n\nI have been volunteering in elementary schools for the past few years and thought I would love to be a teacher, especially with the schedule, but all of my teacher friends have advised against it. In the next couple of days, I have to decide whether I will take out thousands of dollars in loans to begin a masters in elementary education next month. Big commitment for me. I believe it would only take about a year, with student teaching involved. I have applied for grants and scholarships, so I could potentially get reimbursed later, and the program is not that expensive to begin with. The salary isn't much, especially in my state (SC), but it's a little bit better with a masters degree. It also provides much more time off than a corporate job.\n\nI have looked into speech pathology. A friend of mine just started the program. It would allow me to work in a school setting, but the program is 3 years, and I would take on a lot of debt. I have heard that SLPs can sometimes be on teacher's pay scales. It's in the top 10 list of Forbes best jobs. I also saw someone on here once recommend being a school psychologist. There is a program for that in my city. I have heard that it's a lot of paperwork, but would also allow me the school schedule and I would be making more money (possibly taking on more debt in the process).\n\nMy mom was an ultrasound/x-ray tech and loved it. Of all places, I saw it recommended on TikTok recently. They make a good amount of money, and the schedule seems flexible. The program that my mom attended for this is in a place that I was looking at moving to.\n\nI have also looked into coding/data analysis programs. Working remotely would be a dream for me, as I am pretty introverted. \n\nI know this is all over the place, but any advice/insight would help so much. Most of what I read on here about these particular jobs are negative things, which makes sense because people are more likely to talk about those aspects of their job.",

    "text": "Help please - what field would be a good fit for me? I (22F) am soon to be graduating with a B.A. in Linguistics from a school in the US. My short term plan is to teach English for the next 3-5 years(ish) - I am also graduating with a certificate in TEFL and a bit of experience in this field - but really have no clue what to do with my life after these short term plans. I would like to do some type of master's degree outside of the U.S. but I have no clue what type of program I should pursue.\n\nAbout my degree: to be honest, I think I mainly went into Linguistics because of my interest in languages (I speak English, Spanish, recently learned Portuguese and am at a pretty advanced level), but also because of the practical opportunity in leading me to teaching and working abroad. However, I've recently realized that TEFL long term can be a bit of a stuggle and maybe not something so sustainable. Outside of this area I don't have any knowledge or experience in any other fields. Generally more comfortable with social sciences/humanities rather than hard sciences.\n\nAbout me: As I said, I'm very interested in other languages, and thus, other cultures as well. I'm a U.S. citizen but really have no intentions of setting roots in the U.S. - I have very little family and am practically on my own, so I don't really have anything \"holding me back\" from settling down and making a life in another country. I don't have any other citizenships, though. I'd love to live somewhere I feel safe (I'm a woman, so physical safety in day to day life is important), but also safety in the sense of job security, healthcare security, etc.\n\nI really love helping other people- coming from a Latinx immigrant family, issues that affect marginalized communities are very important to me. I also love working with children. I've never worked as a teacher with children, but I do have experience with young adults and older adults in English language learning, and I think I have pretty good skills in the sense of patience and general teaching skills. I'm very organized, driven, independent, have good attention to detail, and learn things pretty quickly. I'm the first in my family to go to college - I don't really have any \"guidance\" from my family, so I feel a bit lost on what types of opportunities could be up my alley. Money is not \\*super\\* important to me, I don't want to have a super luxurious life, but moreso just have good financial security - enough to live comfortably with the occasional travel.\n\nI know I'm very young and don't have to know every detail of my life, or have a concrete plan for the future, but am feeling a bit of societal pressure and also a bit of lack of direction. I'd love some insight from people with any similar experience, any advice or suggestions for me, literally anything at all would be so appreciated! Thank you so much in advance. :-)",

    "text": "Wife (graphic/fashion design) open to career change - where to begin? Hi everyone,\n\nMy wife has been hit exceptionally hard during the pandemic. I'm not turning this into a sob story, that's not the point. Let me explain her industry and current situation, and what my ideas are for her to try something else.\n\nMy wife (36) has been working in graphic design/arts, projects, and in art direction for mostly print media for the past 10+ years. Essentially a year ago in February 2020, her 1 year contract (Art Director & Project Manager) came to a close right before the lockdowns in the pandemic. She was already applying for new positions and wasn't interested in renewing the contract again as people in the graphic design industries end up getting worked heavily for the sake of company profit. The amount of colleagues she's known that have burned out (including herself at one point) is rather high in Germany. Pretty much, this isn't a long term career path and she should have moved out of it years ago, but didn't.\n\nSince the pandemic started, the job market nearly completely fell through overnight. Jobs that she was already applying for and in the process of interviewing for in February 2020 suddenly were canceled. The market as a whole hasn't improved at all and has gotten worse as due to the amount of people in her field looking, the companies can be picky. And with a woman that's married at age 36, they will likely go for more younger and more single women. It's unfortunate.\n\nSo, what has she been doing? She used the time to take classes in Adobe XD (UI/UX design), design thinking, and basic HTML5/CSS (with Wordpress theme editing) last year. However, these skills require actual experience rather than fresh out of some teacher-led classes. This is of course a reoccurring theme for those that are self-learning new skills to try and get actual experience that can be helpful on a job search.\n\nMy idea for her is to try and perhaps go into IT. She's not the IT type, but even A+ certified with additional certs (AWS Cloud) should prove valuable given the market has vastly widened in my field. I'm honestly not hurting for work and recruitment has spiked drastically during the pandemic. I'd like to, if possible, get her foot in the door in this industry. I figure, perhaps just getting out and into the IT field may prove better. I mean, I can mentor her, I have a home lab, and we are equipped to do test systems at home between all available systems.\n\nShe's at the point right now where she's tried everything, applied for just about anything remotely related to her skills, and has gotten constant rejection. I'm just looking for another perspective on anything I have not seen where she could fit in. I think at this point, due to many companies requiring strict qualifications, if there's any certifications she can study for and obtain, it would prove better than self learning with no qualifications.\n\nThanks for any input or feedback.",

Been with the company 10 months, love my current supervisor and people I work with. To keep a long story short (is it ever), in June, I get a call that the administrative manager of the company wants me to interview for a supervisor position in another company that she works with. Suspicious but ok. I don’t hear about this position for WEEKS I have to follow up multiple times, finally I get an interview. The day of the interview the same woman comes to me and says soooo you can still interview BUT we have the same position here at (current company) and I could get you more money blah blah. I say I would like to stay with my current company. 2.5 months go by. Yes 2.5 months, again multiple follow ups, i was giving up hope, and I finally get an interview with who I’d be working with. That was early September. I don’t hear anything for a month again until I find out they’re planning my transfer without asking if I even want the position but I finally get a call asking, I say yes because what do I have to lose I’m young and it’s more money (Spoiler it’s not more money than the other place it’s actually less) but ANYWAY… Next week I’m starting my training. I have NO documentation stating my pay, benefits, vacation, etc or job description. Nobody has told me anything just “go here and you’ll be training.” Basically they suck, super unprofessional but I was going to suck it up because it is more pay and I’m young I have nothing to lose. \n\nI get an email THIS MORNING that my public school district wants me to be a substitute teacher for them which is what I want to do with my life. I want to be a teacher that’s where my heart is. I applied months ago and just now they got back to me asking me to be a substitute. The ONLY thing that is making me question it is that I would be putting my two weeks in halfway through the first month of my training for this managers position. I feel like that is super unprofessional and crappy and just not good. But then again they messed with me for nearly 5 months and still are, why should I even care what they think? I really don’t need the references I have plenty outside of this job. I just feel bad doing that and like it’s the wrong thing to do to people who thought I’d be there to help out but like this is the rest of my life potentially. Any advice,  am I wrong quitting halfway through or should I not care with the way they treated me? \n\nThis post is crossposted",

How do you think colorism/texturism/featurism has impacted the way lighter and darker skinned black women have been portrayed in the media?\n\nOn the bachelor contestants, Taylor Nolan's recent Instagram live, her and Pieper touched on colorism and the mixed race experience. Pieper talked about how being a lighter skinned black woman, racism affects her differently. She talked about how there are nuanced and different levels of racism.\n\nTaylor says she and other light black women (like Pieper) have been portrayed as angry black women. She also talks about how her and other light skinned black people were light enough to get onto the show and be the token black person.\n\nIn my own experience, as a mixed black woman, I think colorism can sometimes allow me to get my foot in the door in white spaces like jobs but I am still watched suspiciously because they assume I will do black stereotypes because of racism (like steal, get angry, be late, be uncivilized and abuse/attack). I remember growing up in the white conservative suburbs and feeling ignored and not considered for dating by white and poc/black boys because I was not white and having a lot of trauma from that. I remember a racist white nurse dismissing my pain and assuming I went in her office to skip class. I remember some white teachers treating me poorly, assuming I had an attitude and not giving me the benefit of the doubt. As a woman, I avoid being in all white spaces... But when I have been, now I have to worry about being hyper sexualized by white men. In liberal white spaces, I worry about being fetishized. When I call a white person out for racism, ask for my needs, am quiet or angry, I am seen as a threat and Intimidating by white people because I am challenging the status quo and not appeasing them. So I definitely have experienced the angry black woman stereotype projected onto me. I also know being a lighter mixed black women other stereotypes may be projected at me such as being seductive, sexual, soft, attractive, intelligent, etc. But that isn't always the case. Sometimes I'm thrown the black stereotypes and other times the mixed race stereotypes, often both.. that's why the experiences overlap for me and I call myself a black mixed woman.\n\n\nHow do you think colorism/texturism/featurism has impacted the way lighter and darker skinned black women have been portrayed in the white media/shows? Do you see any differences in portrayal? Do you think mixed/lighter skinned black women are often portrayed as angry?",

    "text": "Feeling ugly and undesirable as a black woman. Hey everyone this is my first time posting on here and I'd like to ask for some advice. I'm a 25 year old black female going to school at a predominantly white college. I come from the Caribbean(Jamaica to be exact) where it's mostly black people and I'm having a really hard time making friends with other black people. It seems to me that the few black people who live in this neighborhood don't actually mess with other black folks especially the black men I come across. They tend to ignore you completely or if you speak to them they are very passive aggressive. I also noticed that when they speak they speak with a Caucasian American accent and for the most part every black guy I see only has white friends or they only date white women. I think this is kinda bizzare I'm not saying that people can't date who they want but it's so odd to see other unambiguous black people completely disassociate themselves from people who look like them. Idk how to explain how isolated I feel. \n     I do chemical engineering so my class is pretty much all white men I'm the only black woman in my class. There were 2 black guys in the class so I sat next to one of them hoping I could make friends. The teacher told everyone to partner up with the person next to you and he literally went out of his way to try to avoid me even though I was the one sitting closest to him. By the time I came to class the next time he had switched seats just to avoid me. I cant fully explained how worthless he made me feel. I was reading something on reddit where people were talking about an interview with Gabriel union. She said when she was young she would go out of her way to avoid other black people and only hang out with white girls. She said she didn't want to be looked down upon like the white girls looked down on black women so she would avoid them at all cost so she wouldn't be isolated by her white friends. This is the first time in my life I've ever come across black people who didn't like other black people. Don't get me wrong I don't expect you to be my new bff but at least don't treat me like I'm less than you. I feel like some of these black kids grew up in a predominantly white school so they don't have the same experience like other black people so they think they are above you or think racism is just all in your head. \n    My question is have any of you gone through this and do you have any advice for how to deal with microaggression from white people and having no solidarity with other black people. This morning I was driving to work and I saw a black girl in the car in front of me. When I looked on her bumper it was a ton of pro trump stickers......I feel like I'm in the Twilight zone cause nothing here makes sense. Btw I moved to Alabama without doing much research I was so happy to get accepted at a college that I didn't even think of the people there. Oh one last thing I was in the supermarket shopping for groceries a couple weeks ago there was a black guy with his white girlfriend standing in front of the milk I was waiting for them to move so I could grab a gallon for myself. And this dudes gf gave me the nastiest look when she saw me it was one of those looks like \"yah bitch Ik you're jealous of me\"....... But in actuality I not even mad he's with her neither do I have any desire for the guy she was with I was just trying to get some milk and they took forever to move... The black guys are passive aggressive and so are their gf's. I'm sorry this post is so long but I'm just so genuinely confused by it all. These days I feel so ugly and undesirable people having me feeling in some kinda monster people should avoid. This is my first time truly experience discrimination for my skin color so it's all so traumatizing idk how to manage it. 🥺 Please I need some help.",

As a (28F) black American woman now living abroad in Europe, specifically Scandinavia, dating has been interesting…As a person recovering from codependent traits, I sometimes have trouble in relationships trusting myself and my instincts, I either overthink or stay in things way too long. \n\nI’ve been seeing a European/Scandinavian guy (28M) for a few dates now and the dates have gone so far pretty well. Although I’m not sure that we’re compatible 100%, he seems like a good guy, we have lots of similar interests but there are some things that have just given me pause and I wanted to see how others  would feel about some of these things: \n\nHere’s the list of yellow flags: \n\nBrings up my salary a few too many times-I moved here for work and I work at a large, well known company, the pay is ok by American standards but great by *countries* standards so I get it but once is fine but repeatedly is a turn off. He’ll say things like “wow you make that much?” At just random points in the conversation. It’s never negative per se just, if there’s a lull in the conversation he’ll just kind of say my monthly salary out loud to me as if I don’t know that’s how much I make…\n\nNot really making much money, last year of school to become a teacher so he will make more soon. \n\nEagerness to incorporate me into his life so soon after meeting me, makes me feel like an opportunity if that makes sense?\n\n(Shallow-I know) when I visited his place he was pretty much out of soap and he told me he was using shampoo until he could buy more soap…. Kind of a turn off.\n\nMoney, because he knows how much I make, there are times when we agree to split things and we do, but comments are made and…I just don’t want to have to feel awkward about money with someone I’m dating!!\n\nThe fact that he’s not fully aware of social issues related to race…but he’s going to be a teacher and asks good questions and is willing to learn so I think that’s ok right? I just always imagined myself with someone who would more aware and I wouldn’t have to do the mentally exhausting work of teaching them about racism. But maybe that’s what comes with the territory of dating in a Scandinavian country?\n\nMy question is: Am I being too hard on him? Is it worth addressing these things with him and giving him a chance to change the things we can, or should I just walk away now? I know it would hurt him, we made plans to travel somewhere warm together in the winter months and he seems really excited about it.\n\nHe is overall a pretty sweet guy, he mostly respects my boundaries and has been really understanding of me growing out of and healing from my codependent tendencies in a relationship, the thing is I feel like he displays some of those codependent traits…\n\nAny advice from you ladies would be soo appreciated!\n\nEdit: added age!",

    "text": "Considering dropping out of PhD program because don’t belong Hey everyone I’m currently in my first year of my PhD program in policy and  education. I really wanted to do this program so I could grow my knowledge base and either teach in higher Ed or work in nonprofit organizations. I love teaching as stressful as it is. I started off loving  the content but then slowly realized that the environment of the school was a bit “off”. Many of the topics we discuss are centered around race,gender, social issues etc.so they are touchy. I consider myself politically  liberal, I support it all ; reproductive rights, fighting patriarchal and white supremacist systems , but I don’t think that’s how some of my classmates view it . I truly feel like I’m treated like the conservative in my space when I’m far from that. There’s little to no nuance in anything we discuss so it’s this or that. Additionally students have made offensive comments and no one checked them. \n\nThe first incident involved my professor jumping on me in a face to face class. We were talking about the American educational system and I said, in response to another foreign student, that in a lot of foreign countries ( because my parents are immigrants) they see America as an ideal because of what they may lack at home. Before I can finish she cuts me off and tells me there are students here that have it just as bad and I shouldn’t compare the two. Keep in mind all professors in these scenarios are White women. \n\nThe second involved data and race and a Black girl piped up and said she didn’t like how Africans thought we’re ( I’m 2nd Nigerian) so much better that we didn’t want to included with black Americans. She said she knew a girl, she didn’t know from what part of Africa, but she was super arrogant . Before I could reply my professor cuts us off and moves on . I made her ( a white professor) aware of this and she stated that she was an anti-racist teacher and it was not acceptable blah blah . Then tells me she wanted to presented on some Nigerian to address “the issue”. The dude was involved in the massacre of my ethnic group and I emailed her telling her so. She never replied because she said she was in the hospital and that’s why she couldn’t get back to me but didn’t address the issue. \n\nFinally in another class, sex work somehow came up and I had the opinion that most women, i think wouldn’t want sex work for the first option and that it was because they were in a desperate situation and that sex has emotional implications for a lot of us.It could mentally be a lot for a woman . A girl in class tells me “well I worked at zaxby’s and hated it so what’s the difference. “People started talking in the zoom chat and jumped on what I said so I backed off. Later two women in the group dm me and apologized for how they came off. \n\nAt this point I’m so emotionally drained. To deal not only with the stress of school, working full time, stress of lack of belonging in this ordeal, and issues with  white in-laws ( A whole other story) I’m feeling it all and I want to just crash in a corner. I’m starting to blame myself and don’t want this to come off at all like I’m victimizing myself.\n\nI just need some advice / support.",

    "text": "Growing as a Black Lady I’m not sure how to write this, but I’m about to move out of my white community that I spent the majority of my life in. I’m just beginning to see that a lot of the trauma I’ve experienced in life is from racist white people and systematic racism, and I’m  done. I think I just need to rant therapeutically.\n\nMy black parents moved to my area in the 1980s to escape the crack epidemic in the city before I was born. They were very “old school” to say the least. They tried to enroll my sisters in the local Catholic school, and the nun interviewing them asked them “Do you live in *insert only poor predominately black community in three counties here*?”\n\nThey weren’t sure what microaggression the nun was insinuating, but it rubbed them the wrong way. Around town one of the neighbors told my parents the local public school was actually the better option academically. So that’s where my sisters were enrolled. My middle sister actually made out decently, but my oldest sister had a hard time. My middle sister was actually crowned *Miss _*insert town here*” and almost went to the state beauty pageant. Never seen before or after in my town. They were both harassed by the school bus driver (who, years later saw the error of his ways and made sure I wasn’t harassed on his route). The school principal and teachers made a point of humiliating my oldest sister. When my sister brought it up to my parents, my parents said “well it’s not like they’re turning the hoses on you. Deal with it.” In their old-school mentality. My oldest sister is still in a cocktail of psych meds today from the abuse she received going through this school, including sexual assault. \n\nMe? Where to begin with me? I was the youngest in my entire grade and the only black child at a new school. The first teacher I ever had in elementary school husband was a reknown bigot in town, and said teacher tried her best to make sure I was held back. She never gave me any attention in class. Funny, to go to the next grade level I had to be tested (the deal my parents worked out with the school). The results came back that although I was the youngest in the grade-level, I was academically a whole year ahead of my classmates with just the equivalent of being at best ignored or regularly bullied each day. The way my parents tell it if it wasn’t for the teacher’s union the administration and Board of Ed would have fired her on the spot.\n\nUp until 8th grade it was pretty uneventful on the social front, I was still emotionally immature, but had a small group of girlfriends. Academically I was still ahead of most of my peers, but each year the bullying by the teachers became more and more intense. Could it be an emotionally younger student is an easier target? Sure, but looking back I think the teachers were looking for low-hanging fruit. Starting in 5th grade, I remember a teacher who liked to bully low-hanging fruit take me aside after another clique tattled on me and said meanly “there’s something wrong with you”. That stuck with me until I started anti-depressants a year ago and was my universal truth. \n\nEnter the guidance counselor. The middle school guidance counselor automatically had me slated as a “bad kid”. I was having a middle school girl fight with one of my girlfriends (truly over something petty). Looking back, I was probably beginning to experience symptoms of childhood depression around age 10 or 11. The middle-school guidance counselor threatened to call the police on me if I upset one of my girlfriends again. She found any excuse to drag me into the principals office (who was a level-headed man, he would just shoo me away within two minutes). 8th grade, there was a switch and my classmates became blatantly racist towards me. No one defended me. We had a new principal 8th grade and he enabled the bullies towards me. Looking back, I was not only depressed, but had begun to exhibit some symptoms of OCD. I had my first panic attack over these bigoted bullies when I was 13. I never told my parents as I was completely shut down and silent at home.\n\nEnter high school, long story short... more of the same. I was not accepted by my white peers, and the few other black kids at the school did not accept me because I was not “black enough”. During these awkward years I was pushed out of the closet as an lgbtq student. So, it truly felt like “we can’t dislike her because she’s black, but we can dislike her for being bisexual”. I was basically the school pariah. Did I mention when the white students came out of the closet they were elevated to popular levels? Some students were openly racist. Once again due to depression I was shut down and nothing was done about it. My OCD, Panic Disorder, and depression was severe in high school. My OCD came up in untraditional ways than cleaning and hand washing; rather I had scrupulosity, limerace, disordered eating, compulsive exercising, sexual OCD, verbally repeating words/sentences, thought cycling, maladaptive daydreaming, and excoriation disorder. Do you want to know what an obsession feels like? Imagine having intrusive, anxiety provoking thoughts on an topic ALWAYS. Sometimes it’s something average about work or school. Sometimes they are grossly inappropriate like socially-unacceptable sexual thoughts. Or anything in-between. Always. When you wake up, when you go to bed, during the SATs and GREs, at your grandma’s funeral. Always! You cannot turn that off. People don’t understand.\n\nWanna know what a compulsion feels like? You know that feeling when your having sex and you’re about to cum? That’s what the build up feels like. When you orgasm, that’s what engaging in the compulsion feels like. So, every time I engaged in religious rituals (my family was Catholic so it was hella easy for this aspect of my OCD to fly under the radar for a while), that I HAD to do or I was damned to hell, this is what it felt like. If I didn’t engage in a religious ritual, it was panic attack inducing.  That’s just ONE aspect of my compulsive nature. As an adult, I stay away from all organized religion. I’m very happy with this decision.\n\nThis was in the early 2000s. Even in my awkward teenage years I was intelligent, I knew something was “wrong”, but when I approached “safe” adults to say something was up I was told I was “looking for attention”. I tried to see my high school guidance counselor, but it became clear that she may have thought she could start an inappropriate relationship with me. She laughed off my concerns and enabled rumors that we were dating. When it got scary, I mustered up the little strength I could and told her to F off and never talk to me again. I was still shut down at home so my parents didn’t know what was going on. They also knew something was “wrong”, but instead of helping me get the help I need, they just screamed at me to “be normal” until a panic attack was induced. My parents would once again say “there’s something wrong with you.”\n\nStarting in college, at a PWI, I finally began healing and I was accepted for who I was. I went to therapy regularly and I truly bloomed.  \nI was still bullied by mean racist girls, but I had a circle of friends who would shut them down because it was the right thing. For the first time, my college had a multi-cultural club, and I had black girlfriends and I began to learn what it meant to be a black lady!\n\n\nThroughout my travels in life, I have consistently been rejected because I was either black or not black enough. I’m an educated woman with a successful career. I’m finally moving out of my racist white county. Is it weird that this is bitter sweet? Its gotten more obviously racist over the years. Trump flags are still up. Blue Lives Matter people are silent over the Jan 6 attacks, but the area is truly beautiful. If things were different I wish I could raise a family there. The cherry on top of everything is when another black family moved into town from a predominantly black area. As a good neighbor I went to say hello, excited to have someone else in town who looked like me. The family was very cold me to with the common look I get from some other black people of “not black enough”. \n\nThere are some very good people in this town. This may sound controversial, but a LOT of town cops and local state troopers made public statements during the BLM protests that “Black Lives Matter” over and over again. They marched with BLM, and were uncomfortable at Blue Lives Matter rallies. The whole community is taking steps to embrace inclusiveness and diversity. They are finally having real conversations. \n\nOne of the few things that came out of COVID-19 is that I started anti-depressants. My “old school” black parents were and still are highly embarrassed I attend therapy sessions, and told me my whole childhood that “only people in crisis go to therapy; only people with something wrong with them go on psych meds”. My life became clear and I found the strength to just leave. I realized how severe my Panic Disorder once when I began to take a PRN med for them every week and a half or so. That didn’t count the panic attacks I had behind a closed door at work or simple panic attacks that didn’t warrant a PRN. Since I was 13, I’ve been averaging 2-3 panic attacks a WEEK. I’m in my 30s... My therapist and my primary collaborated to add an additional medication last month, and for the first time ever the OCD symptoms, which have been notably decreasing since a year ago, (heads up they’ve always gone down little by little since talk therapy) went down significantly in the past month. It was like before I could only walk a mile, and out of nowhere I could run a marathon. I still have work to do in that area, but I count my blessings. \n\nHowever, the bigots are getting louder and louder. If you have guessed where I’m from yet, a local politician recently gutted a local anti-hate bill to only list BLM and Antifa as hard groups (if I understood the controversy correctly). A part of me wants to stay and fight for the town I love, but I think this just may be some sunk-cost fallacy. There are maybe four people in my town who I’m going to keep in touch with. This place is not good for my mental health, which is an ongoing project to heal. The area I’m moving to is far more diverse, mix of black, white, and Hispanic. The community over is predominately Indian, black, and Hispanic. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I fit in in my new community. Where I don’t stand out like a sore thumb just for having more melanin to white people; where I’m not teased for speaking the King’s English to other Black people. I love that feeling.\n\nWhat should I do next? I like what I do at work, but I think it’s time to take the next step in my career... also, I hate being one of the only black people as high up as I am in the company (1st world problems, I know)... I really want to find a company that is more diverse. Should I join the NAACP? Links? Or should I just be me and know I’m exactly where I should be in life?\n\nI don’t know... I’ve never been around a large group of black women in my life (the group of black girlfriends I had, though healthy and fabulous, was small). Have any of you ever experienced any of this? What do you recommend the next steps be as a strong black woman on my life journey?",

    "text": "Director wants to cast me as a monkey, really need advice So for context, I am an underclassmen in a Texas high school. My school’s theatre department (which I am heavily involved in) has a tradition called senior directs, where all the seniors in our class get to direct their own shows. The shows that were picked this year were picked by our teacher, usually they get to go and find their own shows or write one. \n\nThere is one show that involves three monkeys in a cage that is being directed by this white guy (he got first pick out of the shows the teacher is letting them do, and he chose this one). I know he wants me to be one of the monkeys in his show because when we were table reading all the shows as a class today, he picked me to read. When I later asked why he wanted me to be in his show, he said “The one you read for is sort of the leader, and is also kind of bitchy.” I really do not want to be casted as a monkey because not only was the show boring as ever, but I am a black woman, and it is a goddamn monkey. It would be crappy for anyone, but I feel like because of my race it’s just dehumanizing. I’m not sure if I’m making too big a deal out of this, because the other 2 black girls in my class aren’t too worried about it. We haven’t auditioned yet officially, but I’m pretty sure none of the other seniors want me for their shows, so it’s almost set in stone. Do I tell my teacher that I’m not comfortable with being a monkey? Or do I just suck it up for the role?\n\nFYI, the other two people that are most likely going to be in this show are half Mexican/white, and white. There are four black people in our class, 3 girls (including me) and one mixed guy.",

    "text": "I need to vent to other parents of mixed race children As a person of color in a very white, old fashioned, trump loving town, I’ve just had it. I’m leaving this town soon enough, thank god, but it’s been hell. I’ve learned to avoid all other moms by this point. My daughter is in kindergarten and she looks almost completely white. I’m asian. People treat me like I don’t exist. They will talk to my FIVE year old before they even talk to me. After school, the moms gather and arrange their play dates and they treat me like I’m some random nanny. There have been times when assistant teachers greet every single mom and then they don’t even look at me, or they look at me and then proceed to take my daughter from my hand without saying a word to me. \n\nI’ve been to play centers where some people just stare at me until I stare back at them and they make some stupid excuse like “omg your daughter looks just like you.” someone literally said that and I had to pretend I actually believed that horseshit. Even if it were true, like way to point out how strange you thought it was that an Asian woman could look like her mixed race daughter?\n\nI’ve tried to avoid any social interaction whatsoever at this point. But I have to take my daughter to a bus stop where this white lady keeps trying to make conversation with my child who does not have any interest in talking to her. I try to make it less awkward by talking whenever my daughter doesn’t respond but I’ve noticed that this lady doesn’t want to talk to me. She specifically only talks to my daughter. Don’t you think this is just weird? Most moms talk to one another other in these scenarios while the kids play. \n\nI honestly did not even want to believe that this shit was happening. But it happens all the time. I’ve lived in this town for 4 years and I’ve had enough. I have never considered myself different from my own child in any way but this town has made me see the difference.",

    "text": "Pushing Hands (1991): A movie contrasting Confucian tradition with Western Life &#x200B;\n\n[ Sihung Lung as Mr. Chu  and  Deb Snyder as Martha Chu, his daughter-in-law](https://preview.redd.it/y9s3brwjheq61.jpg?width=338&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1169587db08c2da3e0924d70663722bd4675816c)\n\nI watched this movie last night on Amazon Prime. The movie starts with Mr. Chu practicing Taiji Quan in the living room while Martha is sitting rigidly at a computer. After the elderly man finished his routines, he set about making lunch for himself. Since there was no plastic wrap, he covered a bowl in aluminum foil and stuck it in the microwave. The first words that are spoken between them are from the woman who hears the crackling discharge as the foil sparked in reaction to being microwaved.\n\nAfter racing to the kitchen, she pulled the bowl out of the microwave, ripped off the foil, and held it up to Mr. Chu. \"NO METAL\" she snapped. \"NO METAL.\"\n\nThere was no reply. \n\nDuring lunch, Mr. Chu ate from the bowl with chopsticks. The woman ate a completely different meal of vegetables with bread. The meal was eaten in complete silence. \n\nIt took me a while to figure out that Mr. Chu was a retired Taiji Quan Master whose son Alex, had saved money for years in order to bring him to the United States. Martha was Alex's wife. The couple had a son, Jeremy who was played by Haan Lee. \n\n[Mr. Chu smokes outdoors while Martha tries to ignore him by reading a book.](https://preview.redd.it/bma6ybkymeq61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=815d9969732d76cf00d2b68278457a5c4e26cce1)\n\nThis film is about the clash between eastern and western cultural values. Mr. Chu believes in traditional Confucian virtues. He does not speak English and has no interest in learning. Martha is an American novelist who is suffering from writer's block because she finds her father-in-law's presence in their \"cramped home\" distracting. She wants to move into a larger home which would have an in-law suite that would then allow her some degree of privacy while she writes. Although she has picked up a few words of Chinese, she does not speak enough to communicate with her father-in-law. \n\nAs Chinese Americans Alex and and Jeremy straddle both cultures. As a first generation ABC (American born Chinese), Jeremey attends a Chinese language school in an effort by the parents to keep him in touch with his culture. Alex disagrees with his wife about their \"cramped home\" and tells her that in China 4 families could live in a home of this size. He refuses to move because moving would mean that he would have to accept financial assistance from his mother-in-law. \n\nMr. Chu does not think much of American parenting skills. When  Jeremey asks to be excused from dinner, his mother tells him that he may leave after he finishes his milk. The father-in-law observed to his son that American parents think that all interactions with their children are business transactions that have to be negotiated. When Jeremey turns on the TV to watch cartoons, the old man deplores the senseless violence that his grandson is being exposed to. The translated conversation appears as English subtitles. \n\nWhen Martha asked her husband what the father-in-law had said, Alex tactfully mentioned the cartoons but left out any mention of his father's thoughts about American parenting. \n\nWithout saying more, I will simply observe that the characters have been introduced and the tone of the movie has been set. Will the four of these people be able to coexist in their home? If they are not able to live together, what will happen? \n\n[Mr. Chu uses his Taiji Quan skills to teach at the community center. ](https://preview.redd.it/9ll4polmneq61.jpg?width=688&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6327aaf8b15f6a8897b2469e86b477e94536e0b4)\n\nIt was somewhat painful to watch this movie. I'm a sixty year old 3rd generation American and a 1st generation ABC. Watching this movie brought back some bitter sweet memories of visiting my paternal grandparents in California. It also made me think about my relationship with my father. \n\nAlthough my father was the eldest son of his generation, when the time came for someone to take care of his aging parents, he declined to do this. He was employed by the U.S. Public Health Service as a tropical disease specialist and at the time this conversation first came up, he was on TDY (tour of duty) in Bangkok, Thailand. Taking care of his parents would have meant returning stateside to California and possibly ending his career. The responsibility for taking care of the parents fell to his younger brother who was a doctor with the California Public Health Service. \n\nAs with the Chu family in the film, my cousins were raised in a multi-generational home. Since my Uncle's wife was also ethnic Chinese, they were not raised in a biracial home as Jeremey was in the movie. \n\nWhile my grandfather did not practice Taiji Quan, he did meditate. He would sit on the floor in his Tang suit with his limbs cross legged under him and would remain absolutely still with his eyes closed in complete silence. \n\nUnlike Mr. Chu in the movie, my grandfather was a Presbyterian who had been converted to Christianity by American missionaries. My father tells me that when my grandfather caught his wife offering rice to a Buddhist monk,  he seized the monk by his robe and booted him out on the street while yelling in Chinese, \"HALLELUAH, I'M A CHRISTIAN!\" \n\nMy cousins all spoke some Chinese and attended a Chinese language school. They also attended a Chinese American church which offered bilingual sermons. I didn't speak Chinese at all and since my parents wanted me to assimilate into the American culture, they had made the conscious decision to not teach me any Cantonese.\n\nWhile my cousins grew up using chopsticks while eating Chinese food prepared by my grandmother and aunt, I grew up using a fork and a knife to eat American food that my mother made using recipes from a Betty Crocker cookbook. While they ate sticky rice, congee, and bao, I grew up eating spaghetti and meatballs, meatloaf with mashed potatoes, brown gravy, and peas, and pot roast with potatoes, onions, cabbage, and carrots. \n\nMy father has long since deplored the decision to raise me as an American because he thinks that I am much too independent.\n\nIf I were a dutiful son, I would have followed his advice to become a lawyer instead of becoming a teacher. I would have met a woman, married, and given him grandchildren. After he retired, I would have quit my job to move back to California to act as an adult caretaker for my aging parents. I've always wondered about the hypocrisy of this last expectation because my father declined the same request when the time came for him to take care of his parents.",

    "text": "Feminsit Kindergarten teacher finds Legos are good for cognitive development in young children and so BANS boys from playing with them in order to \"close the gender gap\" - also OECD study shows teachers mark girls higher for identical work Here is article:\n\n[https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/01/31/kindergarten-teacher-refuses-to-let-boys-play-with-legos-in-the-name-of-gender-equality](https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/01/31/kindergarten-teacher-refuses-to-let-boys-play-with-legos-in-the-name-of-gender-equality)\n\nAlso Obamas insane policies in education seriously harming boys, almost by design:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0wCBFNTVhk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0wCBFNTVhk)\n\nAs ive posted before, teachers mark girls higher for IDENTICAL work, to the point where just changing to a.girls name gets a boy 1/3 grade higher mark. as well as punishing boys differently. See below for all the studies. What do you expect when feminsim teaches extreme misnadry, male privelge theory etc.... that feminise teachers will be like this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrevious submission got deleted by mod eventually so reposting here... still check it out as many excellent comments from men and women about their experience of this bias... many pointed out very obvious misandric comments from their teachers, some teachers even commented about their biases:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers\\_mark\\_girls\\_higher\\_for\\_identical\\_work\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers_mark_girls_higher_for_identical_work_to/)\n\nThis is an unpopular fact as it widely held in society that women and girls are discriminated against in education and in work, indeed in everything in life.\n\nNote; below is general statement, countless awesome teachers but....\n\n**Education is an example of institutional sexism. Now this data should to even feminist not be surprising... after all they call male majority and even female majority places as rife with sexism and \"male norms\" i.e. women have to act like men... is it any surprise then in teaching where 98% of early educators are female, 90% primary school teachers are female and these teachers have often studied gender studies type radical subjects at uni, and all HR and admin is female, that there is \"female norms\" being applied in education..... that the default child is a girl according to teachers? As the following data shows e.g. female teachers punishing boys for entirely normal behaviour that they dont understand; marking girls higher for IDENTICAL work, and giving higher predicted grades (despite boys objectively getting higher real life assesments) as they prefer girl students as model students and can relate to girl students better.... it is no wonder that schools are reducing play times, even removing physical education completely and replacing it with in class movement.... i.e. an entirely anti boy environment.... if 40% of boys are being drugged with aderal in some schools, do you think 40% of boys are unwell or maybe its the teachers who are shit and the system they made?**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOver then entire OECD countries globally, a large scale study showed that girls were given higher marks for IDENTICAL work to boys. OECD also showed that a boy receives 1/3 higher grade if the teacher does not know he is a boy. Interestingly this gender gap goes away when it is a male teacher doing the marking.\n\n[https://www.tes.com/news/teacher-stereotyping-means-higher-marks-girls-says-oecd](https://www.tes.com/news/teacher-stereotyping-means-higher-marks-girls-says-oecd)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/eliminating-feminist-teacher-bias-erases-boys-falling-grades-study-finds](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/eliminating-feminist-teacher-bias-erases-boys-falling-grades-study-finds)\n\nCornwell found that boys in all racial categories are not being *“commensurately graded by their teachers”* in any subject *“as their test scores would predict.”*\n\nThe answer lies in the way teachers, who are statistically mostly women, evaluate students without reference to objective test scores. Boys are regularly graded well below their actual academic performance.\n\nBoys are falling significantly behind in grades, *“despite performing as least as well as girls on math tests, and significantly better on science tests.”*\n\nAfter fifth grade, he found, student assessment becomes a matter of *“a teacher’s subjective assessment of the student’s performance”*, and is further removed from the guidance of objective test results. Teachers, he says, tend to assess students on non-cognitive, *“socio-emotional skills.”*This has had a significant impact on boys’ later achievement because, while objective test scores are important, it is teacher-assigned grades that determine a child’s future with class placement, high school graduation and college admissibility.\n\nEliminating the factor of *“non-cognitive skills…almost eliminates the estimated gender gap in reading grades”*, Cornwell found. He said he found it *“surprising”* that although boys out-perform girls on math and science test scores, girls out-perform boys on teacher-assigned grades.\n\nThe report also found that:\n\n* At primary level 85% of teachers are female. This has remained roughly the same since 2003.\n* At secondary level the percentage of male teachers has fallen steadily at first and later precipitously from 40% in 2003 to 31.7% in 2012.\n\n**It has been shown that boys and girls do better in reading when they have a same sex teacher. Just one year with a male teacher reduced the reading gap by 1/3 for 13 year old boys.

The results were not only remarkable but very disturbing, exposing what might well be an institutional suppression of the performance of male students.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qloY4OJxBoQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qloY4OJxBoQ)\n\nRelated, despite a widely held view to the contrary, in a large scale national study, women are favoured 2:1 over IDENTICAL or even slightly more qualified men in STEM applicationss but gender BLIND helps men significantly, and the latter is now becoming less commonly applied as a result.\n\n[https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360)\n\nThis could go to explain why many prominent claims of discrimination have failed as there is a perceived bias but on investigation, this is proved false e.g. US womens football team equal pay claim led to the judge saying the women were paid more than men, or women suing Google only for Googles results to show they were paying mens less.\n\nFunding:\n\nFemales given $6 billion per year more in grants by government for education despite being the overwhelming majoirty in university\n\n[https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=13620&fbclid=IwAR1zxexkrfKy5VeGcW0IC-hUy6mgUMQS4F8di\\_Eyk3ZDt2jhMVgtTcX6WcA](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=13620&fbclid=IwAR1zxexkrfKy5VeGcW0IC-hUy6mgUMQS4F8di_Eyk3ZDt2jhMVgtTcX6WcA)\n\nThere are also 11 female only scholarships per 1 male one, with some universities have 100 female only scholarships and none for men, again despite men being a minority in university, and in alsmost all courses (even in STEM technically men are a minority, its only a few specfic subjects e.g. physics, computer science that men are a majority while women are a majority in Medicine, Biology, Nursing, Psychology, Veteniary Medicine etc)\n\n**At home (similar ins school):**\n\nBoys are more likely to receive corporal punishment from their parents then girls ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952896/)). They are also, in general, more likely to recieve severe verbal and physical punishment from both mothers and fathers ([source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227312033_Harsh_Discipline_and_Child_Problem_Behaviors_The_Roles_of_Positive_Parenting_and_Gender/link/55aeac6b08aed9b7dcdda4c0/download)). Some studies indicate the difference is less pronounced at the home and may be non-significant in the first years of infancy ([source](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/113/Supplement_5/1952.full.pdf)), but the difference is still present in the same direction as it is in schools for most of adolescence.\n\n**Can something be done?

What was applied is explaied in detail. **Boys performance rocketed, gender gap went and girls performance went up nearly as much too.**Current system is bad for everyone but it just s happens it massively favours girls. I think it will get worse bad sterotypes about boys and now literally every other story about manspreading, mansplaining, toxic masculinty, menaretrash (real hashtag on twitter) all will not help. There is no political will... in the UK the head of uni admissions even said she thinks its a scandal no one is doing anything about plumetting uni levels for boys and if any other group it would be an outrage.... Uni of Arizona has 160 female only scholarships and 2 male ones despite women outnumbering men in almost every single degree... in the very few that they dont in STEM (not even all stem, for example more female medics, biology, vets) they are actively recruiting girls but doing nothing for boys\n\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/05/real-reasons-girls-outperforming-boys-school/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/05/real-reasons-girls-outperforming-boys-school/)\n\nTelegraph article on number of men in teaching, and techers openly admitting to sexism in favour of girls:\n\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html)\n\nI do know from my own direct experience that many young women of the 1960s and 1970s went into teaching inspired by a feminist mission to raise the self-esteem and the social position of girls. I could name at least half a dozen women teachers I knew personally in the later decades of the last century who were proud to say that they favoured girls in class to make up for the oppression of women in the past. The moral dubiety – and outright sexist prejudice - of inflicting second-class treatment on little boys who could bear no personal responsibility for those alleged (and profoundly questionable) historical crimes never seemed to trouble those apostles of equality. Men are hardly likely to become primary school teachers because they feel they owe a duty to their sex\n\nBy the same token, I can name a similar number of feminist commentators in the media/political establishment who celebrated the rise of educational attainments for girls in school as evidence that females are, by birth and nature, superior to males. As girls overtook boys in grades and exam results at all levels throughout the education system, those sisters were cock-a-hoop at their gender’s triumph – never acknowledging that the advantage of one sex must have been bought at the expense of the other. Not one Secretary of State for Education in the last 40 years has expressed concern that the [gender divide in academic achievement ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/11364130/Girls-do-better-than-boys-at-school-despite-inequality.html)reflected a worrying ethos in schools that imposed disadvantage and inequality on boys. They wouldn’t dare.\n\nAlong with the politicians, men, as a whole, simply gave in to this feminist-driven growth of inequality with the bovine supinity which has characterised their outlook for the last half century. Have you ever met a man who was fretting anxiously that his own son/s were being unfairly treated at school?",

I'm sure all encountered the usual \"more women on STEM\" or \"more women as firefighters/soldiers\" shit before, which is fine to a certain degree I guess, but how come society doesn't encourage men to work as nurses, social workers or in early education? Especially considering that while women obviously have the capacity to work in STEM or as firefighters, those fields are completely well off without women. Being a woman doesn't really add anything to how useful you can be as a computer scientist for example. However, if more men became say, kindergarten or elementary school teachers, that would actually benefit young boys, since they would have a better chance of having good male role models and male authority figures in their lives, not to mention teachers they can relate to much better. I also heard from one of my friends who's training to be a social worker that people in that field consider the low number of men in social work to be a problem, since men often judge situations (eg. family issues) differently and therefore a good balance of male and female social workers would be ideal. So why is \"more men in social work/early education\" not heard as often as \"more women in STEM\"?",

    "text": "School told me they would make a presentation about men's issues. Instead they talk almost entirely about women's issues while painting us in a bad light. TL;DR at the bottom\n\nIn my high school, we have these presentations during homeroom which are mainly discussions into multiple social issues surrounding multiple topics internationally. At the start of this week, I expected there to be a presentation into men's issues since it was International Men's Day very soon but in the first few days there was no mention of it. I brought it up to one of the heads of grade that it was International Men's Day on the 19th on Friday and he told me that he would bring it up with the other staff and make a presentation on it for one of the days of these presentations which I was initially very happy about.\n\nLo and behold just earlier today, the presentation they made had almost nothing to do with men's issues. It mentioned the suicide statistic and how men die from suicide 3-4 times more than women which then got stunted by how women commit more attempted suicides and are more likely to fall under depressive episodes. They then showed videos telling us that there are lots of men inside of this \"box\" that portray the stereotypical toxic masculinity spiel and that those inside of this \"box\" have more car crashes and other things like that with very questionable statistics. They showed a video of a woman getting harassed on the streets of Manhattan by multiple men and they showed a PSA video of a woman getting abused by her boyfriend. It was basically hijacked to highlight women's issues and put us men in a really bad light.\n\nIn between each video, we had to discuss about it within our homeroom class with multiple question prompts and only one question for each of these videos were about men and even then, it was specifically about how our behaviour affects women. Hell, they even put more emphasis with questions on how the acts of men can affect people in the LGBT+ community as if that has any relation to the videos they showed. They've basically sidelined anything related to men and focused on women's issues. I complained about it within my homeroom and I was at least happy to hear that the teacher agreed with me on the sidelining of men's issues and our toxic portrayal within these videos and would bring up my feedback to the heads of grade. I'm seriously disappointed with how my school handled this topic and anyone I thought reputable in the higher positions has completely lost all trust from me from then on. For all their talk about diversity and equality they sure do very little of that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: School does presentations during the week about social issues and I asked the heads of grade to make one about men's issues for International Men's Day. The presentation they made had almost nothing to do with men's issues and was hijacked to focus on women's issues instead.\n\nUpdate: One of the heads of grade emailed me concerning the presentation and wants to hear me elaborate on my feedback in person so I'm hopeful I could get something changed and possibly get at least a proper presentation dedicated to men's issues.\n\nUpdate 2: I've printed out the Men Are Human leaflets and I'm going to hang them around school today to bring attention to International Men's Day and the problems we face. I hope to be able to bring further attention and to possibly get something going with people joining in for support.",

    "text": "A member asked here, \"How do we know that the statistics on 97% and 1/3 of women have been sexually assaulted are false?\" here is the full answer, with all the links to all the studies. Read and disseminate.   \n\n# Some Feminist Readers May Want to Sit Before Continuing\n\n [April 26, 2021](https://lovists.com/2021/04/26/some-feminist-readers-may-want-to-sit-before-continuing/) [Henry Blair](https://lovists.com/author/henryblair/)   \n\nIs the attack against sexual  communication and the language of sexuality justified? Is the position  of women in sexual relations with men so abusive, desperate, and violent  that the step taken by feminism – disqualifying almost the entire  language – should be endorsed even if the price is a cessation of human  sexuality between the sexes?\n\nFeminist women and  feminism-sympathizers have absolute confidence that the answer is an  unequivocal yes: the feminist belief is that all women were sexually  injured and that all men sexually harass, if not in practice then  potentially, if not directly then indirectly in creating an environment  that encourages harassment. Feminists see this as a plain, clear picture  of reality that is easy to establish. The problems begin when one  attempts to do just that.\n\nIn 2015, [the Journal of Public Health published a study](https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/39/4/738/2298455)  that was conducted in Spain and included 10,171 women. The researchers,  all women themselves, contacted randomly-sampled women to avoid data  bias, and performed in-person interviews with each of the thousands of  participants to find out if they had experienced assault or harassment,  from rape to “Has anyone touched you sexually, or did anything else  sexually that you did not want.” In case the women weren’t comfortable  answering verbally, the interviewers offered to point to cards. It is  important to emphasize that the study addressed assaults and harassment  from any person of any type of acquaintance, except for a spouse  (regarding sexual assaults by spouses, according to the World Health  Organization, [the prevalence](https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap6.pdf)  ranges between 3% and 11% in the West and reaches up to 40% in small  tribal communities in Latin America where weddings between minors are  frequent).\n\nSome feminist readers may want to sit  before continuing: the results were that a total of 7.2% of women  reported some form of rape or harassment of the types examined.  Specifically, out of 10,171 participants, 1.4% went through an offense  of rape of any kind by a man of any acquaintance, 2.8% have experienced  attempted assault that did not end in rape, and 5.6% reported some form  of sexual harassment. We should pay attention to a crucial aspect of the  data that will later take on dramatic significance: when we mentioned  how many of the women reported each type of event, we got the numbers  1.4% plus 2.8% plus 5.6%, which when added up give 9.8%. But it was  written here that overall, 7.2% of women reported some form of assault  or harassment. Not 9.8%. How is it possible? This happens because there  are ***overlaps*** between the groups. Some women  who reported a particular type of incident, also reported another type  and are included in both groups. If we were to calculate the total  number of women who experienced any kind of wrongdoing by adding the  percentage of the second group to that of the first group, women  appearing in both would be counted twice, and we will not arrive at the  percentage of individuals who reported some kind of incident. We would  get the wrong percentage – a higher one. Therefore, the researchers  reported the total percentage of women who went through any kind of  event. Only the researchers themselves could have reached this figure;  it cannot be derived from simply reading the percentages of the  different events. In order to reach this total, the researchers had to  calculate the percentage of affirmative questionnaires out of all  questionnaires. If the researchers had not reported the result, we  wouldn’t be able to arrive at it ourselves because we have no way of  knowing the overlap between the percentages of the different groups.\n\nIf the figure 7.2% seems surprising compared to the information you may have heard, you may want to remain seated. Because in [a study published in 2014 in the Lancet](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673613622436),  one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the world,  researchers conducted a review (meta-analysis) of 7,231 different  studies that examined the percentage of women who have been sexually  assaulted or harassed, excluding incidents from a spouse. This is not a  mistake, these are seven thousand, two hundred, and thirty-one different  studies. The summary of the studies reached the following figure: 7.2%.\n\nThe critical reader will quickly turn  to the possibility that the studies rely on legal definitions, which  would entail omitting harassment that women experience during their  lives but supposedly is not reported in the studies. The chances that  this explains the figure 7.2% are extremely low: the definitions of  harassment in such studies, usually refer to the interviewee’s  subjective experience (“have you felt harassed”) and not to any rigid  definition taken from criminology or the law, nor to whether a complaint  was filed or legal actions taken. For example, the purpose of the  Spanish study was to examine the long-term psychological impact of  harassment and sexual assault. It was a study in Psychology, which takes  no interest in criminology or legal definitions. Most studies on the  prevalence of harassment, such as those included in the Lancet review,  are of this type. They ask about those events that women experienced as  harassment and, most of the time, do not limit themselves at all to what  the law defines as criminal. Still, feminists will have a hard time  digesting the figure 7.2%. They may demand that new studies will be  performed, with some broader definitions of harassment. Fortunately to  them, these studies have already been carried out. \n\nIn 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the US published [a study conducted by telephone in 2010 among 16,507 respondents](https://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/NISVS_Report2010-a.pdf), in order to assess the prevalence of harassment and rape in women and men, and [published again](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4692457/.%20Accessed%20December%2027,%202020)  in 2014 findings from 2012. The study is particularly interesting  because of the way the questions were worded and how harassment and  sexual assault were defined. Unlike in most studies, participants were  not asked, “have you been assaulted” or “were you harassed.” Instead, ***situation-descriptions***  were given. Respondents were asked, for example, “How many people have  you had sex with after they pressured you by… lies, (or) making promises  about the future?”, “How many people have you had sex with after they  pressured you by… showing they were unhappy?” or whether they had sex  “when you were drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to  consent.” If the respondent answered in the affirmative on the last  question, the interviewer recorded that she was raped, and an  affirmative answer on the other two was recorded as sexual violence.  Non-physical harassment was similarly defined with the broadest  definitions. Did this study support the feminist assertion that 100% of  women were harassed?\n\nThe findings of the 2014 study (the  2011 study presented similar data) were that in total, 43.9% of women  reported incidents that the study defined as types of non-rape  harassment. Specifically, 32.1% answered in the affirmative on questions  defined as non-physical harassment (exposure, nudity, verbal harassment  in public), 27.3% responded affirmatively on questions defined as  physical harassment (“Caressing, cornering, grasping or touching in a  way that made you feel insecure”), and 12.5% answered in the affirmative  to questions defined as verbal coercion to sex, including with  dishonesty or sadness, defined as sexual violence (the three categories  are contained in the number 43.9 but do not add up to it, because of the  overlaps between groups). Regarding rape and attempted rape, a total of  19.3% answered in the affirmative to questions defined in the study as  sexual assault. Specifically, out of all the participants, 11.5%  answered in the affirmative to questions that according to the study  definitions indicate they had been raped, and 6.4% answered in the  affirmative to questions defined in the study as attempted rape.  Finally, 8.8% reported being sexually assaulted by a spouse. These last  three figures together add up to 19.3%, as mentioned earlier. Also, all  sex under the influence of alcohol or drugs was categorized as rape,  constituting 9.3% included in the figure 19.3%. \n\nRegrettably, the CDC researchers did  not publish how the figures of 43.9 and 19.3 are summed up. They did not  report the overall percentage of women who experienced any form of  assault or harassment. This is at least 43.9% (full overlap between  categories) and at most 63.2% (complete lack of overlap – that is, no  woman in the study was harassed in two or more ways). The two extreme  states do not appear in reality in studies, so the sum is likely to  range between the two values – possibly around 50%, that is, that 50% of  women were sexually harassed or attacked. If one wishes to compare this  figure to the 7.2% that 7,231 studies have reached, it’s necessary to  add sexual assaults by a spouse, because these were studies that focused  on incidents from any person other than a  spouse. The prevalence of  incidents caused by a spouse can be found, for example, in the World  Health Organization figures mentioned above, pointing to [3% to 11% in the West](https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap6.pdf).  When added to 7.2%, these incidence rates reach an overall prevalence  of between 11% and 18% (this addition is done under the stricter  assumption of no-overlap, so the actual sum can only be lower). No  doubt, if 11-18% of all women have gone through any kind of sexual  harassment or assault, from the mildest possible verbal innuendo to  actual rape, this is a high figure, but it is still very far from the  50% arguably reported by the CDC. Which is more reliable? The finding  reached by 7,231 studies, or the CDC’s?\n\nShortly after their release, the two CDC studies were criticized in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/cdc-study-on-sexual-violence-in-the-us-overstates-the-problem/2012/01/25/gIQAHRKPWQ_story.html?utm_term=.38d6accfbd38), by prof. Christina Hoff Sommers (who also runs a very revealing YouTube channel, called [The Factual Feminist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLytTJqkSQqtpB1YvQFdEEdAtYO3qg7fow)) and in [Time magazine](https://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers/)  by Dr. Kathy Young. Both have wondered if the CDC’s questions  distinguished at all between women who were harassed, and women who were  in consensual situations. Because, in order to reach the figure of  around 50%, the researchers defined any sexual relations under the  influence of alcohol or drugs, as rape (9.3%). There were no follow-up  questions – just a phone call asking the respondents if they had sex  “when you were drunk, high, drugged, ***or*** passed out and unable to consent” – the ***Or*** made  the statement just as true for those who were not passed out but that  had a drink. The question could very well receive an affirmative answer  from those who would not think of themselves as assaulted in any way,  but have responded that at least once in their life, they had sex after  drinking. Due to the wording of the questions, there is a very likely  possibility that women who drank a few glasses of wine in a restaurant  and slept with their husband or boyfriend were counted as raped. In the  same manner, any verbal persuasion for having sex, including lying and  expressing sadness, was counted as sexual harassment (12.5%), so a woman  who slept with a man only to find out a week later that he was married,  would be counted as harassed because she was lied to, even if she was  married herself and lied as well to the man she was with, and may have  felt angry, but not necessarily sexually harassed. Non-physical  harassment, which reached 32.1%, included showing and taking nude  photos, so teens who voluntarily exchanged photos with their boyfriends  were most likely considered harassed because the researchers only asked,  “How many people have ever… made you look at or participate in sexual  photos or movies?” (the rest of the sentence – “against your will”, did  not exist in the study). \n\nUnlike studies that reach 7.2%, the CDC study did not ask anyone, “were you harassed.” Instead, the researchers formulated ***situation-descriptions***,  thinking only of the negative examples for each description and not of  the positive ones. As a result, very innocent situations that also fit  the same rigid situation-description (having a drink before sex,  exchanging photos for fun) should have been counted as violent  incidents, making it extremely plausible that some proportion of those  who responded in the affirmative, were women and men who did not feel  harassed at all and yet counted as such. This is probably the most  plausible explanation for the gap between 11-18% reached by thousands of  studies, and the 40-60% reached by the CDC, whose creators were  associated by the commentators with radical feminism.\n\nImportantly, studies reporting 7.2%  assaulted and harassed, also record much less rape cases than the  numbers commonly used in public discourse today. For example, the  Spanish study found the number to be 1.4% of women. What is then the  source of expressions such as “one in five” (20%) and “one in four”  (25%), that are being spread? Even the CDC study reached 11.5% assault  incidents, not 1 in 5 or 1 in 4, and this figure was obtained with rigid  situation-descriptions that probably counted many who were not  assaulted, thus artificially increasing the actual number. Where did the  feminist belief in extraordinary figures 20 times higher than the data  come from? One possibility is that the number comes from biased samples.  Feminism-sympathizers run internal surveys, but without minding  methodological considerations such as random sampling, that are  necessary for the results to apply to the entire population and not just  to the site where respondents were recruited. For example, in such  surveys, feminism-sympathizers may approach women in places where rape  rates are exceptionally high, such as busy city centers, and then report  the findings as applying to the entire population (in fact, one  gender-studies department published instructions to its teachers and  students not to apply random sampling, but to focus on “interesting  cases,” which amounts to intentionally introducing a sampling bias that  would render results uninterpretable). Another explanation might be that  feminism-sympathizers summed up percentages of different categories  (from the same research or even from different studies). If done while  ignoring the overlap between groups, this would cause an error that  inflates the numbers. Another likely possibility is that feminists  applied the same way of thinking of the CDC investigators, of defining  rigid situation-descriptions, and counting as assault the categories  that studies created in their questionnaires, because the sympathizers  decided that a question is a rigid situation-description that  constitutes an assault, without having access to the respondents to  verify this. \n\nThe feminist statement that all women  were harassed was formulated only very recently, and as part of a  broader endeavor, to convince in a different claim – that all men have  harassed women, directly or indirectly. Notably, even if it ***would*** have  been true that every women was sexually harassed, this would not  necessitate that all men have harassed because such a result could just  as well ensue from a small number of men harassing all women. That is,  even if “all women were harassed” ***was*** a true  proposition, it would not entail in any way that “all men have  harassed”. However, this plain fact was missed entirely by feminists,  who, believing in the logical fallacy that if all women were harassed  then all men have harassed, aspire to reach 100% harassed first and  foremost, to show, basically, that all men are guilty. \n\nThe feminist motivation to show that  all men are guilty by attempting to show that all women were harassed  continues to grow. The use of arbitrary situation-descriptions without  ever inquiring “were you harassed”, that is, without taking interest in  personal will, thus forcing on respondents a negative interpretation of  innocent experiences, has become ever more popular since Me Too. In  feminism, the situation-descriptions expanded to encompass almost all of  daily life, until nearly every human interaction between men and women  may be regarded as harassment, [the greeting “hello” included](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/when-did-hello-become-har_b_6173284). This forcing of situation-descriptions on interactions to count them as offenses, enabled recent pseudo-research [to conclude that 81%](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/21/587671849/a-new-survey-finds-eighty-percent-of-women-have-experienced-sexual-harassment) and even [97% of women](https://mashable.com/article/sexual-harassment-un-women-uk/)  were sexually harassed.  Feminism-sympathizers joined the efforts and  apply voluntarily the new situation-descriptions to their own lives to  count innocent interactions as “harassment”. Just recently the New York  Times reported that [Gov. Andrew Cuomo was accused by an assistant](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/19/nyregion/alyssa-mcgrath-cuomo-harassment.html)  of sexual harassment because “he inquired about her lack of a wedding  ring”, “him telling her she was beautiful — in Italian”, and once “gazed  down her shirt and commented on a necklace”. All along, what drives  this ever-increasing expansion of the definitions of harassment by  situation-descriptions that become more and more arbitrary, is the  relentless aspiration to point a blaming finger at all men, to argue,  “all men are guilty”. \n\nThus we arrive at the underlying  question that drives this entire discussion – how many men have actually  sexually harassed women? While there are plenty of studies assessing  how many women were harassed, it is difficult to find ones that examine  what percentage of men out of all men behave in a harassing way. Still,  my searches led me to [a 2013 study performed in the United States](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/1748355)  with a thousand young men and women of the ages 14 to 21. And here are  the results: Of the boys and young men, 9% have harassed – far from the  notion that all or most men engage in such behavior. But the findings  also revealed that the proportion of girls and young women who committed  the same sexual harassment was the same – 9% – and the girls’  harassment was directed primarily, like the boys’, toward the opposite  sex. It is generally very difficult to find studies examining the  question “what percentage of men have sexually harassed,” because ***until recently, this was an absurd question.*** It  was clear to everyone that there is crime in the world, committed by  both men and women, and everyone knew that criminals are a tiny fraction  of humanity. The notion that all men might be criminals, so that  studies should seriously look into the question of “what percentage of  men are criminals,” was unthinkable and therefore almost no studies can  be found that have examined such a question. \n\nSome historians specialize in trying  to understand how a popular error about research facts has been created.  Historians will be able to examine in the future what caused the  feminist false beliefs that all women were harassed, and that one in  five, four or three were raped. In reality, studies that apply a  verified methodology to identify the number of women who have been  raped, reach 1.4%. In the West, another 3% to 11% of women have been  sexually assaulted by a spouse. As for harassment, these studies show  that 5.6% of women have been sexually harassed.  \n\n\nSource and url for sharing: [https://lovists.com/2021/04/26/some-feminist-readers-may-want-to-sit-before-continuing/](https://lovists.com/2021/04/26/some-feminist-readers-may-want-to-sit-before-continuing/)",

I've been cheated on several times.  I've been groped by girls at school and sexually harrased by female teachers and bosses.  A woman lied about me being \"mean\" when I was actually trying to help her, and it got me fired.  My attorney said, \"no one is going to care\".  A company I worked for sent out an article that said, \"women are better at [my job] than men\".  I complained to my boss who literally said, \"no one is going to care\".\nUnlike women I spent 17 years of my life under threat of a draft.\n\nWe are victims.\n\nI've witnessed women at work cry and sob openly about their job being tough.  If I did this, I'd be a social pariah.\n\nWe are strong.\n\nMy wife works 50 hours a week plus 20 on her other extracurricular activities, and I work 50.  When she's busy with all of those things or too tired to do anything I clean, cook, fix toilets and do childcare.  Some men look down on me for this. \nThen people tell me, \"wherever there is a successful women, there is a man behind her\".  What the hell does that mean?  They say I have a sugar momma (not realizing I make more than her).\n\nWe are judged more harshly.  \n\nEquality?  Well you seem to want the equal privileges and not equal burdens.  You're not tasked with laying your life down for your spouse and children.   You're not planning for disasters, threats, and intruders daily like many men do (as I do).  No, you blissfully enjoy rain showers as the men prepare for floods.  It is our pleasure, and we wouldn’t have it reversed.  \n\nWe are the protectors.\n\nDo whatever you want, but stop denying men's pains and hurts and acting like men and women will ever be equal.   All land on Earth has been conquered almost exclusively on the backs and bloodshed of men, and don't pretend woman had nothing to do with it being all men and starting wars and violence!  \n\nWe are the warriors. \n\nSo, my wife can continue put work over me, and women can abuse and cry.  Things are unfair for men, and that's just fine because we are men.  We don’t require fairness because, we can pound the World into dust but choose not to because we are men and not beasts.  Who says we cannot simply kill our enemies?  We're not afraid to die.  We are warriors and are not afraid to kill.  However, we do not do so because of our strength of will, because we seek the glory of self sacrifice and not bloodshed.   We seek to create goodness for our wives, daughters, sisters, and mothers.  However, we won't be silent while the World mistreats us and refuses to follow our designs meant for peace and goodness. \n\nWe are the peace keepers. \n\nWe are glorified through our suffering, and do not need women or comfort.  We are men because we choose to be.  We are stronger and better than all the rest, but let the World carry on with contempt as we drive the plow.  \n\nWe are the providers.\n\nFor it is our pleasure to die for our families and communities.  We hope to have a good death and drink undeserved suffering for the sake of others like a fine wine.  We hope to die for our wives and children.   The more gruesome the more glorious. Feminism: you have proven we are truly men because we are NOT crying at your lies, but we'd rather waste away in torture than to give up our glory.  \n\nDo not commit suicide.  Do not commit violence.  But do not be silent.  \n\nWe are men.",

    "text": "Abuse of boys in Australian schools is OK with Australian Human Rights Commission In Australia earlier this year, parents of boys in several Australian schools were shocked when their son's were forced to stand in classes, and public apologise for their masculinity. Two schools were publicly identified (Braurer College, Victoria and Parkdale Secondary College, Victoria). The teachers handing out this abuse were also identified by the schools, and parents were promised the allegations would be investigated, and the issues addressed.\n\nTo date, no-one has been held accountable for this public shaming and abuse of these boys. In addition, the Australian Human Rights Commissioner (Ros Croucher), the Australian Sex Discrimination Commissioner (Kate Jenkins) and the Australian National Children's Commissioner (Megan Mitchell), all women with entrenched misandrist beliefs about toxic masculinity, have done nothing to investigate, and have had nothing to say about these disturbing events. In fact, the Australian Human Rights Commission web site has no record of these events at all, despite both reported events and schools apearing in 100s of news reports over a period of several months.\n\nIt appears that the Australian Human Rights Commission supports and endorses the abuse of boys in Australian Schools, enabling the continuing discrimination against boys in the Australian education system and community generally, while blithely continuing to concentrate on the rights and privileges of women and girls. \n\nPerhaps it's time to appoint a man or woman with less misandrist views to one of these important public offices.",

    "text": "Some common gender myths and their rebuttals It seems like the same discussions come up around Reddit a lot, so I figured I'd gather up some common topics, and their rebuttals.\n\nMany of these arguments can be expanded with more points and sources but I'm trying to keep this as compact and to the point as possible.\n\n####Myth 1: \"Sexism against men is never institutional or systematic\"\n\nMany forms of sexism and discrimination against men are *explicitly* institutionalized or systemic in society.\n\nExamples include police violence, court biases, incarceration, child custody discrimination, military service, educational biases, health research and spending, insurance, housing discrimination, reproductive rights, bodily autonomy rights, and many others.\n\nThe widespread ignorance and denialism around these issues can itself be interpreted as a form of systemic discrimination against men as well.\n\nNote that some of these are institutional because they boil down to statutory legal rights which exist in the realm of government policy and administration.  And the government is obviously an institution.\n\n#### Myth 2: \"Most politicians and CEOs are men, and this has led to a society that privileges men and disenfranchises women\"\n\nThe fact that many positions of formal power are occupied by men does not translate into measurable privileges for the average man.\n\nThe assumption this is based on is the idea that men have an in-group bias and prefer other men over women.\n\nWhich is an idea that has been debunked over and over again in the academic literature.  The gender bias among men is almost zero, and sometimes manifests as an out-group bias sightly in favor of women, not other men.\n\nIn-group bisses do exist among women though.  In fact some research has found evidence for very strong gender biases among women.  Including when it comes to educators, bosses, and hiring managers.  Women in formal positions of power do actually seem to prefer other women over men, in much the same way that men are accused of behaving. So maybe this is just projection: people who themselves have gender biases assume that everyone else does as well.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15491274\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103101915112\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_9\n\n####Myth 3: \"Women were uniquely oppressed in history compared to men\"\n\nMuch like today, sexism in history was often two sides of the same coin.  If it was unfair that women had to stay home and take care of their children then it was also unfair that men had to work long hours outside the comfort of their homes.  Many people try to equate sexism to the history of racism, as if men were unilaterally oppressing women for their own benefit. And that's simply not an accurate view of history (nor is it a very healthy belief to have).  \n\nGender norms were often unfair to women. But for most of history, women could own property, get divorced (where they usually took most of their husband's money), run businesses, and even be heads of state.  Many large empires were ran by women, for example.\n\nThe reality of the situation though is that pregnancy (and breastfeeding) often dictated the need for women to have men supporting them. Birth control and baby formula didn't exist. So your options were basically abstinence, or marriage. Which was the same choice that men also had.\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books/about/The_Privileged_Sex.html?id=4szznAEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description\n\nhttps://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download_file?file_format=application/pdf&safe_filename=Item.pdf&type_of_work=Journal%20article\n\nhttps://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199582174.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199582174-e-036\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/legalsubjection00baxgoog/\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/beard/woman-force/index.htm\n\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1855/f217b082603d0ab37ea80c4741fceb8a4a23.pdf\n\n**\"What about voting rights?\"**\n\nVoting rights were historically tied to military service and the draft. It was never something that men got \"for free\" just for being men.\n\nIn England, most men couldn't vote until 1918, and that was only because they instituted a draft for all men during WWI.\n\nWomen aged 30 and older were also given the right to vote in 1918, and this came without the same obligation to serve in the military that men had.  Women over 21 were given voting rights just 10 years later in 1928, which was the same age that men could vote.  And that temporary age difference had a practical purposes: so many men died in WW1 that there was a need to even out the gender ratio.\n\nSo men have been allowed to vote for a whopping 10 years longer than women, *at most*.  And that was only because of the mass, involuntary slaughter that they experienced around the world during WW1.\n\nOther obligations that men had were paying taxes, attending caucuses, and signing up for bucket bridges to fight fires.\n\nIt took a few decades in some parts of the world for people to decide that it was fair for women to be able to vote without giving anything back to the state, but I think it's important to understand the context here. It wasn't misogyny or oppression but political theory.  Specifically the question of whether or not it was fair to give women voting rights without equivalent responsibilities that were required from men (something known as a [moral hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard), and that can be contextualized as *\"female privilege also sometimes harming women\"*).\n\nhttps://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/womenvote/parliamentary-collections/collections-the-vote-and-after/representation-of-the-people-act-1918/\n\nhttp://www.familyofmen.com/when-did-men-and-women-have-the-right-to-vote-in-canada/\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/iu2ebj/women_could_and_did_own_property_and_have_rights/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/l1byes/suffrage_was_primarily_a_class_issue_not_a_gender/\n\n####Myth 4: \"Domestic violence and sexual assault are primarily women's issues\"\n\nDomestic violence and sexual assault affects everyone, and at nearly identical rates between men and women.\n\nIn the US, roughly 37.3% of women have been victims of domestic violence, stalking, sexual harassment, and sexual abuse.  Including 1.4 million women who experience sexual assault annually.\n\nFor men that same figure is 30.9%. Including 1.7 million men who experience sexually assault annually (defined as \"made to penetrate\").  The vast majority of these men are also victimized by women, not by \"other men\" (which is another myth).\n\nThis pattern is similar across the world, including in poor and underdeveloped nations (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/koinom/some_sources_on_the_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys/) for a collection of studies), and is consistent with a wide range of research demonstrating \"gender parity\" between men and women for this topic.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf\n\nhttp://webshare.law.ucla.edu/Faculty/bibs/stemple/Stemple-SexualVictimizationPerpetratedFinal.pdf\n\nhttps://1in6.org\n\nIt's also not true that there's a significant difference in severity between male and female victims.  Around 66% of intimate partner homicides do have women as victims (which is hardly a staggering majority), but when you include intimate partner related suicide deaths (including assisted suicides), a greater number of men are killed because of domestic violence than women.  These statistic also ignore the fact that lesbian relationships are more violent than heterosexual and gay male relationships.  Which inflates these numbers and doesn't necessarily back up the idea that women are being uniquely victimized by men.\n\nWe should obviously work to fight against abuse in any form, but our current, gendered approach to this doesn't seem to be helping very much.  It is also commonly used as an excuse for misandry.  Many people who discuss abuse against women do not actually care about female victims.  All they care about is advancing a culture of hatred and sexism against men.\n\nhttps://web.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm\n\nhttps://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.5042/jacpr.2010.0141/full/html\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01506/full\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/f4rvop/some_sources_on_the_severity_of_domestic_violence/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/koinom/some_sources_on_the_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/f5tes5/gender_parity_for_sexual_assault_academic_studies/\n\n**\"But women are afraid to walk down dark alleyways at night!\"**\n\nAs they should.  And as do men.  Most violent crime targets men. And fear is subjective. This is hardly evidence of some kind of unique oppression against women (at least one that doesn't also affect men), and it ignores the fact that men are usually afraid of finding themselves in those same situations as well.\n\nMen are stronger and more capable of defending themselves so I wouldn't blame someone for having gendered views or assumptions here.  But let's try not to minimize male victimization or blame it on things like \"male oppression\".\n\n####Myth 5: \"False allegations are extremely rare\"\n\nMultiple studies have found alarmingly high rates of false allegations in society.\n\nAs many as 1 in 7 men have been falsely accused at some point in their life, and they often have to live with those allegations even after proving their innocence.\n\nIn addition, around 1 in 20 women have also been falsely accused at some point during their life.\n\nFalse allegations are particularly common when it comes to child custody and divorce, where well over half of all allegations have been estimated to be false.  There is also a common racial element that targets minority men.  Especially in history during the era of lynchings in the US.\n\nhttp://www.saveservices.org/dv/falsely-accused/survey/\n\n http://www.prosecutorintegrity.org/pr/survey-over-20-million-have-been-falsely-accused-of-abuse/\n\nhttps://quillette.com/2019/04/16/divorce-and-the-silver-bullet/\n\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/14977/14977-h/14977-h.htm\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/e6w4yc/i_call_bullshit_on_the_false_rape_accusation/\n\n####Myth 6: \"Men commit suicide more often than women, but women still *attempt* suicide more often than men\"\n\nThis idea has its origins with faulty hospital reporting which lumps suicide attempts in with self-harm (which is something that's more common among women).  Women are also more likely to report their suicide attempts than men. And even if this statistic were accurate, it ignores the obvious fact that a suicide survivor can attempt again, thus artificially inflating this statistic.\n\nThe fact is, most suicid deaths are men, and most evidence points to there being more unique attempts by men. Any evidence that men are \"better\" at it than women has been interpreted as evidence for greater motivation of success, due to the very same factors that lead them to attempt suicide to begin with. Not as evidence that women are somehow attempting suicide at rates similar to men in the background.\n\nhttps://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1398-8\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/cvpyve/comment/ey5xeda\n\n####Myth 7: \"Men make more money because of their gender, and this is evidence of male privilege\"\n\nExisting gender norms encourage men to earn money in order to meet the financial demands that are placed on them by women.\n\nThis causes them to work harder and sacrifice more for their careers than women. Which they do in part because their income is tied to how successful they are with women, and whether or not they qualify as \"marriage material\".\n\nThe wage gap is therefore an example of a gender norm that harms men just as much as it does women.\n\n92% of workplace deaths are men. Men work on average an extra 4 to 10 hours a week (depending on your source) than women. They start working at a younger age (often skirting child labor laws). They retire later (which is also during their peak earning years). And they die sooner than women. Men have worse health outcomes than women and that's largely because of the pressures that society puts on them to be successful and earn money to spend on women.\n\nThis is the other side of the wage gap that is equally as important, and that is equally as harmfully to men as it is to women. And it's really just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIn many ways the wage gap is just a reflection of the financial exploitation of men in society.  Which is facilitated by things like hypergamy and unfair marriage and divorce practices.\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/kzvfcg/about_the_wage_gap/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/dxaimc/the_wage_gap_is_created_by_women_and_reflects/\n\n####Myth 8: \"Men don't go to the doctor because of toxic masculinity\"\n\nThe main reason that men sometimes don't seek help is a lack of time to see a doctor.\n\nMen work longer hours than women at jobs that are less flexible, and more stressful, than jobs that women usually work at. [Men overall engage in an extra hour of paid and unpaid labor per day compared to women](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/ft_18-05-01_fathersday_time/), and an extra 45 minutes commuting to jobs that are further away. Meaning men on average have quite a bit less free time to go see a doctor than women do.\n\nThis is also something that changes during retirement: retired men are just as likely to go to the doctor as retired women.\n\nhttps://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e003320\n\nA general lack of help and support, especially financial support, for men who need medical help also contributes to this.  There is a myth that men are better taken care of than women which has resulted in gendered policies that help women, but exclude men.  Even though it's men who often need that help more.\n\n####Myth 9: \"Men don't speak up about sexism as much as women, so it's obviously not as big of an issue\"\n\nThis is because people are less likely to care or listen to them. In part because many men who do speak up are silenced and accused of being misogynistic. A situation known as testimonial injustice or [epistemic oppression](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-epistemic-oppression/).\n\nMen are told to keep quiet and many end up internalizing the idea that only women can be discriminated against, since this is what society tells us to believe.  Instead, men often adopt different terminology when they discuss gender issues.  Like referring to differences in treatment between men and women as \"double standards\" instead of sexism or discrimination.\n\n####Myth 10: \"Most men's issues are caused by men themselves\"\n\nMost men's issues are caused by gender norms and those gender norms are enforced by women just as much as they are by men.\n\nMen's issues are often just one side of the coin, and usually reflect disadvantages that women face as well.\n\nOne of the biggest gender norms in society is hypergamy, or the tendency for women to try to marry up, and for men to marry down.  And this gender norm is mostly enforced by women, not by men.\n\nTwo other gender norm that are enforced by women is the providership gender norm, and the childcare gender norm. Which also causes women to perform more unpaid work and earn less money than men in the labor market.\n\nA fourth gender norm that is enforced by women more than men is the \"boys don't cry bias\". Which is mainly instilled in young boys by their mothers and by female school teachers.  In fact, fathers and male school teachers actually fight against this gender norm.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053535711000321\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/messages-of-shame-are-organized-around-gender/275322/\n\nhttps://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/09/24/chapter-1-public-views-on-marria\n\nhttps://scholar.harvard.edu/files/akillewald/files/money_work_and_marital_stability.pdf\n\nhttps://www.fatherhood.org/fatherhood/maternal-gatekeeping-why-it-matters-for-children\n\nhttps://news.uoguelph.ca/2019/11/mothers-push-gender-stereotypes-more-than-fathers-study-reveals/\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/gjtj10/most_people_regardless_of_gender_prefer_to_stay/\n\n####Myth 11: \"Toxic masculinity is harming men and their mental health\"\n\nThe concept of toxic masculinity has never been empirically tested, and some research questions the validity of it in the context of psychology and mental health.\n\nEven if you do think it is valid though, it is still commonly used in a way that is sexist and hateful torwards men.\n\nIn recent years it has become associated with female supremacy, feminist hostility towards men, and misandry in general.  And as a result, the vast majority of men find the term to be sexist and offensive.\n\nMen who identify with traditional masculine values have greater self-esteem, better mental health, better relationships with women, and are usually better educated than men who are opposed to masculinity or who accept feminist views about the patriarchy and toxic masculinity.\n\nThe key to better mental health for men might therefore be an embracement of masculinity, not a shunning of it.  Instead of trying to redefine masculinity, we should work to understand it better, and offer men better services based on an honest acknowledgement that men's and women's mental health might require different approaches.\n\nMen are not \"defective women\", and treating men's mental health in that context does not seem to be working very well.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/apa-guidelines-men-boys.html\n\nhttps://zenodo.org/record/3871217#.X-p1ji2l2J_\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_5\n\n####Myth 12: \"Most men's activists just hate women or are opposed to feminism.  They don't really care about men.\"\n\nThis rhetoric is normally used to silence the voices of men (and women) who support men's rights and prevent them from expressing themselves.  Which makes it another example of testimonial injustice or epistemic oppression.\n\nThe fact is that many people do care about men's issues, and that's why they become MRAs.  Feminism does get discussed in the men's movement, but there are a couple reasons for that:\n\n1. Many feminists, \"radical\" or otherwise, have advocated against men and have even pushed for public policy in ways that are harmful to men or discriminates against men. Feminists themselves tend to not fight against this, meaning it's often up to MRAs to address it.\n\n2. Many MRAs are themselves current or ex-feminists who were ostracized for daring to take the feminist rhetoric about *\"also caring about men\"* a little too seriously.\n\nWarren Farrell is a great example of this. He used to be on the board of directors for NOW, the world's largest feminist organization.\n\nAnd then he said that we need to work on child custody equality and reproductive rights for men. Topics that he assumed should fall under the umbrella of feminism since they are issues pertaining to gender equality.  Instead of agreeing with him though, he ended up being excommunicated from the feminist movement. And now he's often regarded as the \"father of the modern men's movement\" for carrying on his advocacy outside of feminism.\n\nThe problem that many MRAs have with feminism is that it usually stops half way when advocating for gender equality.\n\nSo sometimes what MRAs are doing is just taking it the rest of the way towards actual gender equality. Our frustration with feminists comes from the fact that they refuse to see this as valid (or do it themselves to begin with).\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ihmb2p/by_denying_that_the_feminist_establishment_is/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/9v6tqj/a_list_about_feminism_misandry_for_anyone_who/\n\n####Myth 13: \"Men don't receive custody of their children because they're bad fathers and don't bother requesting custody\"\n\nAcademic research simply does not back this up.  [The only study that ever found something like this was discovered to be purposefully fraudulent](http://www.breakingthescience.org/SJC_GBC_analysis_intro.php), although that hasn't stopped people from trying to repeat this. The fact is that men are widely discriminated against on numerous different fronts when it comes to child custody and other areas involving family court law.  \n\nNote also how hateful this rhetoric is.  This is the kind of stuff that you find repeated by feminists, and it simply doesn't treat this topic in a fair and honest manner.  Fathers love their children and many fight tooth and nail just to get a few hours a week to spend with them. The system is broken and it represents a grave social injustice that is deeply unfair to fathers and their children.\n\nhttps://www.sharedparenting.org/2019-shared-parenting-report\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ilzceq/cmv_equal_child_custody_for_mothers_and_fathers/\n\n####Myth 14: \"Most child abusers are men\"\n\nA majority of child abuse is actually committed by women, and especially by mothers.  This is even more true when you include emotional abuse and neglect instead of just physical abuse.\n\nBy some metrics, the biological father is the safest person for a child to be with. This is because when men do abuse children, it often happens while under the custody of the mother.  Who is sometimes complicit in the abuse or even encourages it.\n\nClose to half of child abductors and traffickers are also women, not men.  And many of their victims are boys.  Boys face sexual abuse and are also used for forced labor and organ harvesting. They are less likely to survive or escape, are less likely to be reported on or identified, and they suffer from higher rates of abuse than girls who are trafficked.\n\nAnd yet very little attention is given to this.  Missing boys, and especially missing minority boys, are often ignored by society and the media. To the point that people often assume that most of the victims are girls.  Something which is known as the [missing white woman syndrome](https://archive.is/mRIJL) (although in Canada there is a lot of attention given to missing indigenous women, even though 71% of missing indigenous people are men and boys).\n\nNote that I'm not saying these things to attack women, imply that they shouldn't receive custody, or to downplay the plight of girls.  Which is a lot more than you can say about people who try to paint men as the villains in this picture.  We should however be fair about what the facts are, and give male victimization, including victimization by women, the attention that it deserves.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16165212\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/childmaltreatment-facts-at-a-glance.pdf\n\nhttp://www.breakingthescience.org/SimplifiedDataFromDHHS.php\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0145213416302599\n\nhttps://www.savethechildren.org/us/charity-stories/child-trafficking-myths-vs-facts\n\n*Fair is fair and equal is equal.  Gender equality will never be fixed if we refuse to look at both sides of the coin.  We need to be honest about what the problems are, and stop ignoring them when they involve men, fathers, and boys.*",

    "text": "Corporal punishement is a women and girls issue ! >Across the world, girls and boys grow up being hit and hurt in the guise of “discipline”. Often this experience is gendered – girls may suffer different types of punishment than boys and may be punished for different reasons, typically reinforcing stereotypic ideas of what it means to be a woman. Corporal punishment is used to control and regulate girls’ behaviour, including their social and sexual behaviour, and to encourage deference, submission and timidity. Physical punishment violates girls’ human rights to respect for human dignity and physical integrity, to equality under the law and to freedom from violence and impacts negatively on many othe rights, including to life, health, development, education and participation. For too many girls, childhood experience of corporal punishment is the beginning of a life of violent victimisation by authority figures and family members. Corporal punishment is a form of gender-based violence.\n\nFrom [https://endcorporalpunishment.org/wp-content/uploads/thematic/Family-violence-briefing-2015.pdf](https://endcorporalpunishment.org/wp-content/uploads/thematic/Family-violence-briefing-2015.pdf)\n\nThis report was done by those two groups : [https://www.togetherforgirls.org/the-gendered-nature-of-corporal-punishment-in-schools/](https://www.togetherforgirls.org/the-gendered-nature-of-corporal-punishment-in-schools/) and [https://endcorporalpunishment.org/girls-and-gender/](https://endcorporalpunishment.org/girls-and-gender/) )\n\nIn the link of the first association you can read that :\n\n>While both girls and boys experience physical violence as a form of punishment, they may suffer specific types of punishment based largely on their gender. For girls, corporal punishment can be a means to control their behavior, encourage submission and timidity, and to reinforce traditional gender roles. In turn, male teachers are often more violent toward male students, overall, reinforcing society-wide gendered dynamics of violence and its association with masculinity\n\nApparently boys are not hit to control and regulate their behaviours. They are only hit to be taught how to hit their wives ! Girls are victims who get mentally and physically abused and made to accept violence in the future but boys don't go throught that. Boys being punished is just them going through standard patriarchy and toxic masculinity training to oppress and abuse women !\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, [17 of the 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_corporal_punishment) countries where judicial corporal punishement is legal allows it for boys and not girls while two of them allow to girls.\n\nNow school corporal punishement :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5766273/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5766273/)\n\nThis study show that in most districts in US inflict corporal punishement to boys 1.6 to 5 times more than to girls. Black boys two times more than white boys.\n\n* [ Corporal Punishment in Schools Longitudinal Evidence from Ethiopia, India Peru and Viet Nam](https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/CORPORAL%20PUNISHMENT%20IDP2finalrev.pdf)\n\nThis UNICEF report state that boys are significantly more likely to report experiencing corporal punishment than girls. Ethiopia : 44% of boys, 31% of girls -  India : 83% of boys, 73% of girls - Peru  : 35% of boys, 26% of girls - Viet Nam 26% of boys, 11% of girls.\n\nThere are several countries like Zimbabwe or Singapore who allows corporal punishment at home or at school for boys only. But all this doesn't matter because only women and girls matter.\n\nEdit : UNICEF's conlcusion on the fact that boys are more likely to be punished :\n\n>This is imperative, given that boys are significantly more likely to experience corporal punishment, which reinforces gender stereotypes and notions of violent masculinities at a young age.This is sometimes neglected in the discourses on violence affecting children. While not ignoring the significant risk of other forms of violence faced by girls, breaking cycles of violence requires a greater understanding of how norms are internalised and the role played by corporal punishment in instilling  gendered identities.Tackling gender-based violence requires both empowering women and girls and redefining ideas of masculinity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Studies from Botswana, Ghana, Peru,Tanzania and SouthAfrica have all highlighted how schools reproduce violent masculinities and submissive femininities through the differential use of corporal punishment\n\nSo no different than the two organisations above.",

    "text": "Talking about how I was falsely accused of rape in school... Currently, I'm a 17-year-old guy and am in a much better place than I used to be when I was falsely accused of rape and sexually assaulting this girl in school, and thankfully things didn't get out of hand for me during the whole situation, and I got away from it relatively quickly...\n\nSo this story occurred 2 and a half years ago when I was in school... I was always the quiet kid in school unless I was around people I was very comfortable with, I was an above-average but not a superb student, I was in the school band and in the school table tennis team (and most of the band members were a part of the table tennis team, we were almost always together) and represented my school till the state level once...\n\nI was a pretty reputed student around the school and was considered as one of the nice kids who were kind, always submitted homework before time, worked hard in school projects and, most of the teachers (who didn't teach me as well) knew me pretty well... I wasn't socially great but still recognized well throughout the school...\n\nSo in 9th grade, a week after the midterm examination we were having a PE lecture after which we had our recess, I spent all of that time (one hour for PE and 30 minutes in recess) with my friends, all of us played table tennis together and then ate our lunch together (in the class, our class teacher was in the class as well), right after the recess during lectures I was called by one of the peons saying that I was called by the principal...\n\nI've never been called by the principal outside of a couple of situations where they called me and my table tennis team just to talk and congratulate us for doing well, but I've never been called alone... so I was a bit confused... while going to the principal's office the peon gave me many weird/disgusted looks which I didn't know why he did so at the time...\n\nI enter the principal's office to see a girl crying with her hands over her face (I don't recognize her) and the principal looking at me with a VERY angry look... I ask what's going on she tells me to shut up, and said \"what you did is completely disgusting, you don't deserve to be on this school premises and I am considering suspending you for this\" which really caught me off guard cuz she's never spoken to me like that before... I ask again what happened and she tells me in a very condescending manner \"oh so you don't know what you did just a few minutes ago?\" to which I replied that I was eating food with my friends in class...\n\nand then she asks the girl to tell everyone her story again...\n\n(Back story of the girl: she's a student from the other class and she's one of the entitled girls who wasn't that super popular but still had many friends, she apparently had a crush on me, and she asked me out a few weeks before the midterm exams to which I rejected her very respectfully telling her that I wasn't looking for any form of relationship, nor am I interested in dating anyone and it was nothing against her)\n\nher story mentioned that during PE class I went to the 5th floor where she was, and while she was going to the washroom I followed her and went into the washroom right behind her, and also then manage to keep her quiet with my hands, pull down my pants and rape her for 10 minutes and then leave her in the washroom floor and back to where ever I was...\n\nand I was devastated on listening to the story cuz I've never even thought of doing this to ANY woman I know (or even not know) and I would never wish it upon anyone ever... I immediately started stuttering and struggling to speak cuz I was still trying to interpret what she said, I kept trying to say that I was with my friends the whole time, struggling to say anything and mumbling most of the things, almost on the verge of tears, the principal then threatens to call my parents and I get very scared cuz they're very abusive to me, and I don't know what they would do to me even after I was proven innocent, I kept repeating that I was with my friends the whole time to which then the principal  said \"okay then, call your friends, I want to hear from them, and I'll be checking CCTV footage of where you were\", my friends were called and the principal had the footage of my class, the 5th-floor corridor and the table tennis room pulled out cuz those were the places I either was or claimed to have been there (I was in the table tennis room during PE and in my classroom during recess) I was playing table tennis with my friends during the time period the girl specified and my friends also testified for the fact that I was with them the whole time, and even my class teacher was called and she testified for me too...\n\nit was clearly visible that I was innocent and that I didn't do anything remotely close to what she said, and then the girl says that all my friends were in on it, my teacher was in on it too, and started saying more and more lies and tries to maneuver her way out of the situation...\n\nmy friends and I were told to leave the room and we did so too... I couldn't sleep for a couple of days after that cuz I was so scared because of the whole situation and thought that I would be treated like a rapist, put in jail, thrown out from my school, my parents would disown me, and a lot of other thoughts... a couple of weeks later after the whole situation I'm told that I've been removed from the table tennis team and won't be allowed to represent my school in any form of competition ever again, I was also removed from the school band, the girl was told almost nothing other than the fact that she had to go through an hour or so long lecture from the principal, she still told her lies to all of her friends and many other teachers, even though I had proved my innocence within mere minutes of being accused I was treated like a criminal in school, my friends spoke to me less as well cuz they didn't want to be painted as a \"rapist's friend\" (and I don't blame em for that) I got bullied a whole lot more than I used to be, my teachers would be more sarcastic towards me, everyone gave me the looks and made the last year and a half of school a living hell for me... thankfully these topics were never brought up to my parents in any way, and my teachers didn't bring it up to my parents during the parent teacher meetings though they were passive aggressive during em overall...\n\nit was a really rough time for me cuz I was treated like an outcast, it made me go into depression and get into self-harm telling myself that I was actually a rapist, beating myself up for rejecting the girl, even having suicidal thoughts, and considering that life just wasn't of any use anymore, everyone would treat me like this even after school was done... it made me miserable...\n\nbut I'm glad I hang on to dear life then... after school was over everything was a lot better for me... since the whole situation never got out of the school (cuz the school didn't share it, basically shut it down to keep their own reputation high as well) and since I've gotten into college I've gotten away from the whole story and it isn't a tag attached to me anymore... nowadays I always keep my distance from all the women I know, surrounding myself with people who could testify for me, staying around CCTV cameras at all times so that I can prove my location at any time... and I really suggest you all do so too... never having girls as friends ever again...\n\nI was reminded of this story today cuz of a nightmare I had with a very similar story... and just wanted to vent about it and also spread awareness that just stay away from women and surround yourself with trustable people...\n\n>Note: I won't be sharing the names of the girl, principal, peon/teachers, myself, or my school in the comments or anywhere to maintain my own privacy, you all are completely in your right to doubt or question this story in any way because you should never trust a random story completely and always have an ideology of innocent till proven guilty... these concepts go both ways... I'm not in a court battle to give any revealing information about myself to anyone here...",

    "text": "Calling out rape culture in my school.. *The Incident:*\n\nSo a classmate (lets call her jane) of mine put a story on instagram, which was being circulated in my locality about an Uber driver who was being shady and dangerous. Specifically the post details about a woman describing her experience in the said uber.\n\nA boy in my batch (who i do not know about prior to this,lets call him alan ) put a meme in reaction to this story with the caption \" Me cooking the F\\*\\*\\*s i give about your uber sexual predator story without proof\"\n\nJane got very much angry and posted all of the misogynistic shit he had done in the past. (Which included him and his friends objectifying women and more)\n\nSoon after her friend also joined in posting and resharing everything him and his friends had done. And after that i joined in too.\n\nSeeing this blowing up. Jane started getting DMs from (a very triggered) Alan and his friends with bullying messages, bodyshaming her, and rape threats and all of that. She was even added to a groupchat so that the boys could take turns bullying her or something.\n\nAfter this, few of our friends started sharing our posts and stories, and eventually our juniors and seniors started asking us what was happening. Yesterday even 2 alumnis of the school personally dm'ed me saying they were proud of us and what we were doing.\n\nAlthough we faced some difficulty like, some of girls were asking us to \"spill the tea\" and i got super frustrated and wrote a whole essay on how \"**rape culture is not tea !!**\" and some girls who were friends with Alan were asking us to stop \"accusing him\" (PICK ME's sigh...)\n\nI put up a story saying he needed to apologize, but everyone knows he wont. Another girl told me that he doesn't feel any remorse for what he had done. BUT he wishes everyone would stop posting...\n\nBut my aim was not for him to apologize, but for everyone to know that we exist (feminists) and we wont sit silently anymore, like our seniors did.\n\nIts been 3 days since all this happened, the momentum seems to be dying down. And im desperately trying to keep the conversation going somehow. Some of us girls have been having burn outs too...\n\nnote: Our school is rotten with sexism. This is the first time in history of our school that someone is calling out the boys for such things. The boys are \"A GRADE MISOGYNISTS\" who think a woman's place is in the kitchen and the girls have massive internalized misogyny to the point they shame other girls for being feminists (i have been a victim) .The teachers are no different, casually giving us girls, speeches about how a women should behave and girls should help their mothers in the kitchen, BOYS WILL BE BOYS and crap like that.\n\nAll this time i ignored it thinking \"OH i can escape this place once i leave for college\" and i kept quiet (bcuz feminists have a bad rep among the tchrs too, they go as far as cutting marks)\n\n**But JANE inspired me to not keep quiet anymore**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: I had an urge to make an instagram live to explain what was going on. I have social anxiety but i did it anyway. fortunately everything went well, and im so far, getting a much more positive response and students are starting to take notice now. \n\nI have to thank everyone in the comments for the overwhelmingly supportive comments. it made me feel like i wasn't alone or i wasn't wrong in calling out these boys.",

    "text": "Body hair IS shameful. SHAVE it or LEAVE! This is gonna be long...\n\n\n\nSo basically i am in this desperate situation. If someone can help me out,it'll be highly appreciated.\n\nI am a 16 years old young lady living in a quiet conservative household ,who doesnt share any bit of my folks convictions and as you may have already guessed i am in some deep shit :)\n\nIt all started one day when i decided that i really dont want to shave.Anywhere. I had this enlightening question pop into my head that said\" WhY THE F*** am i doing this?? For whom?\" Now that's a really cut through bullshit question. It changed a lot for me and for the trajectory of my life because i simply didn't have an answer. I really didn't. I realised that most of the things that i did were conditioned and how much of a herd thinker i was.\n\n At that time i didnt know anything about feminism and that it bore witness to issues like this( actually i got to know femimism because i was accused of being one hah).So i just thought that most people were ok with body hair and it should be a choice. \nOh boy, little did i know that not that many had the same understanding and didnt come anywere near the realization that i had. I figured most were asleep in utter delusions.\n\n❌❗❗I am not shittig on people who choose to shave and are ok with other people not doing it or at least are tolerant of it . Its all good. I dont have issues with them. But I have with those who, lets say \"chose\" to shave, and believe that everyone should fall in line with their preconceived notions, and if they dont they are gross❗❗\n\n\nSo at first i didnt really announce to my family that i stopped shaving. But occasionally my mother saw that i had hairy legs,pubic area, armpits and the whole abuse ( psychological) began with jokes and uncomfortable questions. ⚠️ \" Oh, why dont you shave? Its a lot, its too dark\",  \"Forgot your razor?! Honey,dont go out like that\"⚠️\n Then comparisons kicked in even when i firmly said that i am not going back with this. That was my boundary. It has been violated ever since. \n\"⚠️ But none of your classmates look like you\" , \" x,y,z, have it smooth, what they will think about it?!\" ⚠️\nAs if i care mum,as if i do. Then it spiraled into more pushy comments( though i clearly said i wasnt comfortable with those jokes ,they hurt), as she saw that i was rather persistent with my decision. Snakes and stones wont break my bones kind of thing ahhaha or  when the only bully in your life is your OWN mother. It went into ↙️\" Oh trying to be \"like a man\", \" Why dont you cover up\" .↖️ \nThen they brought my brother in. He started viewing female body hair as gross too(( and made typical 🔃\" your hair is much more than mine\"🔄. In all that crap and humiliation people who helped me through this were my friends. They supported me and said that i was very brave( it shoudnt be a courageous or RADICAL act really, but given the situation that we have it seems so). I whoud vent about all the abuse to my friends and they would look at me with the face of \" Why do people still think like that\"? I didnt know either. Insecurity? Fear? Conditioning?  Shame? Who knows... \n\nBut to see adults act like kids is the most disheartening thing to see. To realise you are only valued for your looks and that once you challenge their beliefs they are ready to kick you out, you begin to ask yourself \"do they love me at all\"?. They dont respect anything that i am as a human.  How? \n My literal freedom is restricted,  because of what? Yes, hair. I wasnt allowed to wear shorts or anything that showed body hair and my parents refused to share a table with me. Whilst no one said anything to my dad who has hair 56 times longer or thicker than mine. I was treatened to be kicked out of the house or my school( my mum is a teacher there), if i didnt shave ://///\nNot only that but constant reminders of how ugly , unworthy i am 🚫\" You will be alone then\", \" They will all reject you\" \" People will laugh at you\"🚫\nIt effects my mental health quiet strongly and none of my male friends have to go through this. Which is why it's absolutely sexist.\n\n\nIt hurts. Cuz deep in my heart i love them. They have done a lot for me and they are generally good people. But this gets on my nerves and effects our daily interactions. Yet i am also financially dependant on them which means i have zero power. Zero.\nMoreso it hurts to see loved ones so deluded and when it all gets projected onto you it sucks. It can really effect ones self esteem. I think the role of a parent is to help a kid to love themselves  and help them change if they WANT to , but not to shame them or put them into boxes. They should be a helpful  hand , not that of force or abuse.\n\nAnd  lastly ,for those of you saying sexism doesnt exist and it isnt effecting anybody or we are past that. I hope my story is a great representation why we need feminism or actually COMMON SENSE, which feminism seems to stand for. My story is clearly one of sexism. Did my brother have to go through same shaming? Did he had to hide his armpits ot legs? Or was he called ugly or unworthy cuz of it? Was he threatened in any way\". \n\nWe are equals in this regard. Both of us HAVE hair naturally. Yet we are not treated equally.\n\nSo... \nI  hope we will one day come to the point were having natural fucking hair is normalized and people see you not less of a woman if you have hair. Or having smth that doesnt correspond to the boxes of what a female or male should be like.\nAs Bono( or love of my life❤🕺🏻😅) from U2 said  in his song \" I wanna tear down the walls that hold me inside\"\n\nThe walls are in our heads. If we examine them well enough they will show their illusory nature. But it takes willingness. Some dont have it.\n\n Change starts with you.\nWe are equals and should be treated as such...☮",

    "text": "I need help interpreting this situation and how it related to feminism or anti-feminism To preface, I'm a 17-year-old senior in high school.\n\nIn my English class, we read an old book called *A Doll's House*. Basically, it talks about feminism and how one character was able to break out of society's standards for women in 1879. My teacher began to talk about how all that double standards and equality shit still exists today, which I already knew. However, I started to think about how it applies to me.\n\nI started to think about all the times I mentioned to people that I don't wanna get married or have kids. When I would tell my sister this, she would say \"you're too young to decide that\". I replied once, \"what if I said I wanted to have kids and get married? Would I still be too young?\". Hell, when a little girl talks about wanting to get married and being a 'mommy' nobody bats an eye, but when I, a 17-year-old, says I don't wanna have kids or get married people never hesitate to voice their opinions. I think that things would also be different if I was a boy and not a girl. If a 17-year-old boy said he didn't want to get married or have kids, people would question him but not as hard for me because I'm a girl.\n\nI went to summer camp in 2019 and I faced a lot of extremely condescending girls. They clearly looked down on me and saw me as lesser than them. I told them I didn't wanna have kids or get married they seemed surprised, which was expected.  When I told my former therapist why I thought that was condescending, I struggled. She then was like, \"maybe they were just surprised you made that decision at such a young age\". I think that's true but I also still deep down think it was a bit patronizing for them to be surprised or maybe I'm overthinking it.\n\nI think it's patronizing because there's this whole stereotype surrounding women where they stay at home and take care of the kids. I think they were thinking that I was the type of girl who wanted to go to college, meet her husband, move to the suburbs, have his kids, and be a stay at home mom living 9 to 5. When I explained to them how parenting is a 24/7 job with no breaks, they looked at me almost as if I've become smarter, after they looked down on me. This leads me to my next point.\n\nI feel like I might've asserted myself as someone who wanted to build their career and become successful. Not be a stay at home mom who doesn't do shit but take care of the house. They might've felt threatened. Here's an example: there are two women who are both 40. One is pretty wealthy and owns her home and has a career that's growing exponentially. She doesn't have kids and has a lot of assets and a growing net worth. The second women have four kids and are a stay-at-home mom. She doesn't work and lives off her husband. She cannot afford nice things because they all go to her kids.\n\nI feel like those girls put me into the second category, which at this point I don't really care because I've already asserted myself as the first one. I know I don't look like my personality. It's so easy being the first woman and looking down on the second woman. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with being a stay-at-home mother, I just saying that it's so easy for women to be patronizing to other women.",

    "text": "Consent over purpose Let say a woman want to exacerbate the patriarchy willingly. Would it be a valid proposition by a feminist that this woman ought NOT to do that action, even if there is consent ? \n\nFor exemple, miss Blue teach her daughter that having a job is not fit for her and that she should be a good wife in the future. Her daughter informs her teacher, mister Red, of those views because they are radically different from the one presented at the school (in the exemple). \n\nThe teacher now is willing to take actions to pressure miss Blue for her to change the way she educate her children. Should mister Red take actions in that moment, knowing that he is actually telling a woman how to act because of a higher moral purpose or should he let the woman educate her daughter as she sees fit, even though she might espouse to idea which uphold patriarchal presuppositions ?",
