    "text": "Admin giving food to students who skip class - venting. TLDR; At the end of the day on Friday, admin let four girls who are chronic skippers take a bunch of food from the teachers' lounge, bought for teachers, for Teacher Appreciation Week. \n\nI couldn't find a venting flair , but I am a relatively new teacher. This is my third year at a school in Washington state. \n\nI took first class outside to play games since the weather was wonderful. A lot of kids just wanted to sit out so I let them be on the bleachers where I could see them. \n\nAbout half way through the class and having some fun playing spud, four girls (three of whom I have taught and teach right now) appear and start goofing around with my students. \n\nI simply let them be, since I had no radio to call an admin and I figured it was better for an adult to be able to see them. \n\nOver the rest of the day, as I am in the hallway going to the printer or bathroom, I see these same girls repeatedly out of class , listening to music on a speaker, or talking to an administrator but not actually being sent to class. \n\nFinally at the end of the day, I see an email about food that was bought from a Mexican restaurant for staff. When I get to the teachers' lounge, these same four girls are being let in by the assistant principal and dean to take food for themselves. \n\nI am just baffled by them rewarding these kids in the name of \"building relationships\". It looks like the kids are simply taking advantage of kindness and knowing they can get away with not being in class. \n\nI have stopped caring now. I am not going to bother reporting kids who are skipping, let kids skip in my class, and do my best to make teaching be stress free for me.",
