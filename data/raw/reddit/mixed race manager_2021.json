    "text": "235 Applications - 11 Interviews, Here is What I've Learned So Far Background on Me:\nI have major self esteem issues. Enough that I am in therapy for it. I view myself as the worlds biggest loser for reference. This is not to make it a pity party for me but I think context is important. \n\nMonths ago I was thinking I was a straight up loser in the job market. Working a dead-end entry-level job. No REAL business experience that could translate well into a new job. The only roles recruiters ever reached out to me about were for Admin Assistant positions, which I was not interested in. When I told them, I was looking for more business fronting roles, they would stop replying to me or acted like I was stupid.  \n\nBut here I am. The biggest advice I have is to sell yourself with soft skills and buzzwords when you’re lacking in more important qualifications. Every company loves hearing how I manage multiple different inboxes and tasks. And how I am great at multi-tasking and staying organized. Do I really believe I am good at this stuff? Heck no. I receive tons of great reviews and awards for my work but to me it’s all just luck. But you must be your biggest advocate for just the interview.  \n\n\n\nApplications:\n\nOriginally, I started using Indeed, but felt like it wasn’t getting me anywhere, so I switched to LinkedIn. LinkedIn is where I've gotten 8 of my interviews from. It’s been a mix of both Easy Apply and applying on the company website. If I see the application is long and tedious, I just leave. I have yet to apply with a cover letter. If its a major company like Disney or Google, I would obviously use a cover letter.  \n\nI've applied to jobs that I was good fit for, and for those that I was a close fit, but was maybe missing a few qualifications. \n\nOut of the 11 interviews \n2 were from Indeed\n8 were from LinkedIn\n1 of them was a reference but has led to 2 interviews in different departments \n\nI do not waste my time on assessments BEFORE an actual interview is offered. I don’t see a point in wasting 30-45 minutes of my time just to see if I even qualify for an interview. \n\nI've accepted every interview I've been offered even if I wasn’t initially interested. I think practicing my skills in these situations is incredibly important. And you never know how the opportunity may evolve. If it doesn’t work out, you can see if there’s another position available for you. \n\n\n\n\nThe Interview\n\nI am actually pretty good at interviews. At least in my opinion. I am a hardcore researcher. I look up interview questions on Glassdoor and I have my typical answers for the most basic questions. I learn as much as I can about the company, and you would be surprised at how many managers are surprised I did my research. And whenever a question stumps me, I say \"wow that’s a really good question. I never thought about that before\" and I proceed to answer. And then I write it down so I can come up with a better answer if it ever gets asked again. \n\nOne question I always answer \"honestly\" is the weakness question. I also say I am working on sharing responsibility since I can end up overwhelming myself. And almost every interviewer has thanked me for not giving a generic answer, such as being \"too hardworking\" or \"a perfectionist\". Set yourself apart by answering this request with a real weakness and how you’re working to overcome it. Or just that you've acknowledged it. \n\nAt the end of every interview - I take the time to thank them for their time and I appreciated it. I also let them know that if they are interested in me as a candidate, I am interviewing at multiple companies for full \"transparency\". I do that even if I am not. I am not interested in an interview process going on longer than a month. And as a result, I've got 2 rounds at multiple companies in 1 week. \n\n\n\n\nMe asking Questions - \n\nSome questions I have been asking that have my interviewers saying \"good question\" and are generally impressed with. \n\nFor higher ranked positions: \n - The average tenure of an employee is around ___ years_. What do you think is contributing to this and what is the company doing to retain top talent? \n\nFor possible colleagues:\n- What are some of the challenges you've faced in this role and how did you over come them? Did you feel like the training was useful?\n\nEveryone:\n- Is there anything about my qualifications or me as a candidate that concerns you? I'm happy to clarify anything or answer any additional questions you may have before we part ways.\n\n\nI have yet to receive an offer but I am also way further than I thought I would be in the process.",

    "text": "Rant: Don't just take any damn job. Make sure they care about you and look for red flags So I turned down a job offer that I was peeved about when I thought about the interview experience. \n\nFirst of all, I have been unemployed for +6 months, so a lot of people will probably say \"take it and look for something else\". Which normally, I would agree with.\n\nThing is, my profession is a white collar job mixed with blue collar expectations. Meaning there can be dangerous work, and I'm not talking about using forklifts or moving boxes, no, I'm talking about working with hazardous materials.\n\nAnyway, this company that I interviewed for was only one interview with the hiring manager. I sat down, and they asked me \"For this job, we need someone for nights for a bit during this transition period, can you do this?\" I said \"sure, I can work nights for a bit\". \n\nAnd that was pretty much the only question they asked of me.\n\nWe toured the area, and I asked the hiring manager questions, but something still bugged me. I then asked the exact working hours, and they rambled, but I just smiled and nodded.\n\nThen I left, sent a thank you note, and a few days later, got a call for an offer. But again, I asked about the exact working hours for nights, and they revealed that the working hours are still undetermined for nights.\n\nThen I looked at all the red flags presented to me:\n\n- They didn't vet me at all. It really seemed they only wanted a body to work nights for an unspecified amount of time to \"help them in a time of transition\". It also makes me question their efforts into hiring new talent and the people I would be working with.\n\n- The training they would give me would only be for a few days during day shifts, then I would be thrown to nights by myself\n\n- Not specifying the hours after I asked about them twice tells me that after this \"transition period\" they will probably want me to permanently be on nights, which I'm not ok with\n\nSo really, I'm not ok with a company that isn't straightforward with their employees. I understand being in a transition period has a lot of scrambling around, but an accident on nights is bound to happen that way, and I want to keep my head. Literally.\n\nI know some people will probably call me an idiot, but my gut feeling was that this work opportunity wasn't good. I didn't leave with a satisfied impression that they cared about the talent they brought in. Makes me a bit upset since it was located in a good area, wish it would have been different.\n\n\nWhat are some red flags you found for a job offer/interview?",

    "text": "Why do they ask about your race/ethnicity in job applications? Should they? Hey everyone. So I have noticed that in every single job application ever (in the US) we are asked to say our race/ethnicity. Why? I think that's a horrible idea. I read somewhere it's because that data goes to government, so that they can see there is \"no discrimination\". But wouldn't that make more sense if the data was collected AFTER the person is hired, whoever they are? Especially since nowadays the applications are online, the hiring manager won't know the race or other physical attributes of a person, so they will judge solely on the candidate's resume, accomplishments, etc. I think it gives the employer more chance to discriminate, if the job seekers are asked to write their race. Because then employers could also take the race as a decision driver, and that is very bad. I always have found it so odd, why should my race matter, just look at whether I qualify. \n\nWhat do you guys think about it?",

    "text": "Anyone else been fired for not being a \"cultural fit\"? I'm completely stunned. I got called into the office at the end of my shift and told that I was being let go, effective immediately, due to not \"fitting in\". No warnings about job performance, no negative feedback whatsoever. I had been working there for two months and had gotten nothing but neutral or positive feedback from my supervisor. As recent as last week, I asked my supervisor if there were any areas I could improve on, and she said \"not to my knowledge.\" However, my manager told me today that he had gotten complaints from some of my coworkers that I was \"hard to work with.\" I find this to be extremely absurd as well, as I have always been courteous and polite with my coworkers in every interaction that I have, and have always pulled my weight as a new employee. Apparently, I rubbed some people the wrong way and now I'm out of a job. Out of all the ways to get fired, I hate this in particular because of the uncertainty I now feel. I'm wondering if I said or did anything grossly offensive over the last two months that preempted this. I feel a mix of anger as well, feeling backstabbed and betrayed by people who I trusted to help with my acclimation to this new job. Like I said, there was no warning or conversation before hand.\n\nI'm wondering if other people have been fired in similar circumstances. I'm feeling isolated and disappointed right now, so I'm hoping that I'm not alone in this circumstance.",

    "text": "Fired after only 1 month. 3rd time being terminated. As the title states, I was let go today from my job of barely a month as a business operations associate at an engineering firm. This isn’t the first time I’ve been terminated but a month seems quite harsh.\n\nI have mixed feelings. While I didn’t particularly care for the job itself it was still good experience and the pay and benefits were high. I was hoping to stay at least 18 months but that’s no longer possible. In addition, my unemployment durations vary. There were times I’ve found another full time job within a few weeks to more recently it took over 3 years to land a FT position after dozens of failed interviews and numerous crappy temporary minimum wage work. I won’t survive going through such an ordeal again.\n\nI was told the reason for termination was because I wasn’t understanding the duties quickly enough but no one becomes proficient in a job in only a few weeks unless it’s basic unskilled labor. I will admit though I do have ADD and thus I take a much longer time to learn and tend to struggle with detailed oriented tasks for which this role was extremely detailed oriented (absolutely everything had to be perfect and accurate since we’re of course an engineering firm). \n\nHowever, I’m not sure where to go from here. Practically every non-management job relies on attention to detail and I frankly can’t handle minutiae, repetitive tasks without mentally shutting down (brain fog, low productivity, making silly errors etc) and my skill set isn’t suitable for freelancing. I’ve mainly worked administrative, project coordination and business ops roles. Any advice or possible jobs that might suit me?\n\nAbout me: 27M, no degree, live at home, good with coming up with ideas, bad at details.",

    "text": "How to write a cover letter and resume I heard all of you, so now I am going to be attempt to be a part of the solution and not the problem, so without further ado...here's how to do both, first lets' start with a cover letter.\n\nWhat's a cover letter: A quick nitty gritty view of you that is a condensed version of your resume plus your personality kicked in, so when a few things before I show you how to write one:\n\n1. Have multiple cover letters: If you are applying for a manager role make the cover letter specific to being a manager with the traits and competencies attached to it. A line worker? Customer service? Whatever, you want multiples. Not only will this make it faster for you to apply for roles, but as you build your networking base as you sent out set cover letters you can add them to your job seeker folder on your computer or wherever you store it.\n2. Give it color: I don't literally mean color, I mean don't be afraid to let the interviewer see who you are...\n3. Key words key words key words: You are a master at SAS (software as a service) add it, you know python, HTML, java script, add it, some companies do use screening tools that will look out for this.\n4. Highlight any awards, accomplishments achievements: Even I sold the most subscriptions at gamestop carries weight over a guy who just wrote (worked at gamestop). \n\nSo how do you format? Okay so my cover letter looks something like:\n\nIf you are looking for the best instructional designer in your company for x role, then I 13inchmushroommaker am the guy for you. I have over 15 years in training and development, coupled with my masters in organizational leadership i've had the privilege of working for some of the largest organizations on earth that have gained me such skills as xyz that I have applied in xyz ways. To recap if an ID who is both a great mix of experience and education that has out of the box solutions is what you need then I 13inchmushroomaker is the person you are looking for. \n\nOkay now your resume, and how to format:\n\n1. Career objective: State in 3-5 sentences what your goal is, what you are, what you intend to do, and don't be afraid of putting in where you'd like to be in a few years.\n2. Job experience: What most people don't put here is the software/hardware they used, they only stated what they did. They only don't state what awards, achievements, praises they've won. Did you improve the company at all? Add that.\n3. Education: This goes at the bottom, but the same as above, any achievements? awards? clubs? extra curriculars? You can even attach hobbies here if they have some relevance. You gonna be a security guard? A bjj black belt looks good on there.\n4. Skills: Okay i've notice people just throw random things out there. Don't do that. Gather like terms, you do software? Add all the software under software, hardware under hardware etc. Make it easier for them to scan through.\n5. References: Don't add them, put them available by request. \n6. One page resumes: Fuck that, that is old school. If someone tells you that your resume needs to be one page they can suck it. \n\nThat is not a comprehensive list but it's what has worked for me even to this day, if you have questions or want to call it \"shit\" advice like someone else did, please don't hesitate to do so.",

    "text": "Is it worth taking a pay cut to leave toxic work environment? Hi everyone!\n\nI have worked in my job for 6 years. It is 10 minutes from home. I have an amazing team and director. It is a government role.\n\nRecently, elected officials amysteriously got rid of our county manager. They also placed another official on leave. No reasons given. They appointed an interim county manager who is just awful. He is rude, demoralizing, and throws staff under the bus at any given chance to save face. He is not a manager...no management experience. They just named him permanent for the role despite not reviewing any other candidates.\n\nMy job frequently involves politics but this is just out of hand lately. My supervisor is the best but is actively job hunting. I know he will leave once he finds a good opportunity. When he leaves, I will be in his position and have to deal with the brunt of new management.\n\nIf I leave I would still work in government but I'd lose my 14 days of vacation saved up and would likely take a 10k paycut. We have no debt excwpt our house so i could manage but it would suck. The position i take would be entry level so id have to climb the ladder again.. I would also be adding a 45 min commute to my life. \n\nI love my colleagues but when I come home I just feel down. This was my worst fear come true. My heart has been racing constantly for the past couple days and I feel like I am having panic attacks at times. I've never had these issues before.\n\nAnyways... for those who took pay cuts to leave toxic work environments was it worth it? Any regrets?\n\nMy biggest fear is that it will be the same wherever I go given the politics with my job. But my supervisor and others have told me it is not supposed to be this corrupt and bad.",

    "text": "My usually lovely fiancé has come out with most bigoted, close-minded crap out of seemingly nowhere. I work in an historically very male workplace. They have a recruitment policy of interviewing 50% women, 50% men. My (male) manager has repeated this fact a few times. I'm unsure of his motivations for even sharing that info. Anyway I met my fiancé at work. He's otherwise a left-voting, kind and tolerant person. \n\nThe reason I've made this post is because I told him we're getting two new members of staff, 1 man, 1 woman, and the man is called Igor and he's from Brazil. My boyfriend's responses were \"probably a transwoman or something\". My reaction was ????? He went on to say that the woman was probably black and/or in a wheelchair.\n\nHe just said he was concerned because the way they're handling things is going to result in a lot of young white men getting frustrated at having an unfair disadvantage and it'll backfire with more prejudice, if they keep losing out to them. He didn't use the term 'woke' but it seems like that line of argument has got through to him.\n\nI asked him how a Brazilian man would be unfairly advantaged, like we don't even know his race and Brazil has very different attitudes to race anyway. So I am left wondering where did it come from, and what is the best way to help him de-radicalise.\n\nLike I say, he's otherwise extremely \"progressive\" in our relationship, extremely pleasant to people and actually finds people of other backgrounds and cultures interesting. I was wondering whether other women have found this, and how to cope with it. \n\nIt really doesn't help that we work in a very macho, old-fashioned workplace and have a manager whose actions seem to encourage the idea that women like me had a helping hand and didn't earn our place, but I don't know how to change that either.\n\nIt's making me question my future with him, but I also have to live in a society with men like this so breaking up with him won't change much generally.",

    "text": "Trying to be friends with men can get so exhausting For some background context, I was working in facilities at a tech company for the past 10 years, so working with lots of men in all sorts of capacities.\n\n\nI was harassed pretty relentlessly in ways both subtle and very covert, and I just recently left the company to move to a different role in a different sector, in an office with a lot more women in general, as well as in leadership positions.  \n\n\nTowards the beginning of this year, after one too many of my 'friends' confused their loneliness from covid isolation with feelings for me, I made the decision to stop hanging out with men altogether.  I have very small handful of men that got grandfathered in, but I've been careful to hang out with them only in mixed groups as well.  It has been so awesome, my female friends are so wonderful, and my mental health really improved. \n\n\nLast night some ex coworkers reached out and mentioned they'd be at a bar near my new gig and asked if I'd want to meet up and catch up.  I would be the only woman in this situation. I decided to go because I'm removed enough from the situation, I felt it would be fine. \n\n\nIt was such a wild ride to find myself back in that situation. So for context, when I started my new role, I decided to go in with a fake wedding ring right off the bat to just start setting super hard clear boundaries so I would hopefully not run into the same issues I did with my last job.  Since I came from work, one of my old coworkers noticed and commented on it, and I just said 'Yeah, I was harassed so much at [old job] that I decided to go on the defense at new job.' \n\n\nThat was literally all I said, in a neutral, calm, matter of fact way, but I couldn't even get through that very short sentence without one of them making fake crying faces at me, (implying I was whining) and another one jumping in before I was done speaking to talk about the one time he was sexually harassed at work by a woman.  \n\nIn that coworker's story, he worked with a woman who was, in his words, 'very busty' and used to wear low cut shirts to the office/around him.  At one point he pointed out to her that if he came in dressed that way, that HR would be talking to him.  Supposedly, this enraged his coworker so much that she went to HR to complain, and HR took his side, and told the woman she was harassing him.\n\n\nIn my stories, (which I never got the chance to tell because these guys were mansplaining harassment to me) I was subjected to: \n\n\n1) A director who sent me an unsolicited dick pic and demanded I send him one in return to make it 'fair.' When I refused, he started threatening to get me fired, and would stalk me at work, and threaten me every time I was even near HR's office for unrelated reasons. \n\n\n2) An HR generalist rep who grabbed both my boobs and my ass, at a company party, in front of coworkers.  When I told her not to, she loudly insisted that I liked it.  She later got promoted. \n\n\n3) Another director who pursued me heavily for years. He also grabbed my boobs and my ass, and at one point grabbed the back of my head and forcibly kissed me. He was roughly 3 times my size, very tall and very broad.  When I tried to talk to him about it, he kept insisting I was giving him mixed messages.  He spent years trying to 'neg' me into dating him, constantly bringing up how 'old' or 'fat' or 'wrinkly' I was getting, taunting me that I better settle down soon before I hit a wall. He would regularly say these things in front of coworkers as well. He later went on to date one of the women that reported to him, he is 43 and she is 26. \n\n\n4) A guy who regularly harrassed me to go to a local strip club with him and would insult me loudly when I declined.  He did this almost weekly for about 3 years.  He also found some pictures of one of our 23 year old interns and in a bikini on her instagram and passed it around our office, calling her a slut.  He was 45. \n\n\n5) a coworker who was a peer (middle management) constantly comparing me to his wife or pubescent daughter, and constantly trying to interrupt my work, for example, if I was carrying a ladder, he would try to wrestle it out of my hands while saying he would want someone to do the same for his 12 year old daughter.  I was 34 and his peer, and carrying the ladder was a function of my job. He was later promoted. \n\n\nOur HR director NEVER helped me with a single one of these instances.  She would regularly ask me if the men had 'meant it as a compliment' and tell me I probably 'didn't make it clear enough I didn't want them to treat me that way.'  My reputation at the office is for being very direct and take no shit, but somehow that impression of me didn't extend to telling coworkers not to touch me or harass me? \n\n\nAnyway, that one simple sentence I managed to get out prompted the long story from my ex coworker, the single time he was harassed, over twenty years ago, and HR took his side without him even being present for the complaint, and he honestly thought that was a comparable, relevant story.  \n\n\nHe then transitioned to telling us about all the fun times he used to take his coworkers to strip clubs, and they would try to guess 'which ones were dudes,' which he referred to as 'it' as a pronoun.  He also regaled us with a fun story about a game he used to play with coworkers where they had to call a 'hot' woman they saw first, and if their other coworkers agreed she was hot, they won a point.  If their coworkers didn't agree she was hot, they lost a point.\n\n\nNot a single one of the other men there batted an eye at how the conversation went down, and laughed at his stories.  Fun fact, each of these men agree that our old workplace isn't sexist, because they've 'never seen it.'  \n\n\nI drove home not feeling exactly depressed or anxious, but I definitely left feeling... not great about how I spent my time in the pit of my stomach.  I don't know why I typed this all out, I guess to vent because I didn't feel heard or understood at all last night. \n\n\nI do feel really validated in my decision to limit how much time I spend with men though, which is a little depressing.",

I was promoted to production manager because I know what I'm doing, I know the industry, I know how to talk to people, and I'm good with the crews.  Basically, I was promoted because I am, in deed, good at it.  And yes, I am a woman.  I'm also a small woman and an attractive woman and I wont make apologies for that or pretend that it isn't a factor in my day to day life.  Being a small, attractive, woman has often been an asset to me so no, I'm not going to \"hide it\" or pretend it isn't a thing.  Because goodness knows, if you're a woman in construction, you at least should have the decency to be butch enough that the men aren't attracted to you.  Sorry.  It's not my problem if you can't control yourself at work... Even if, it often becomes my problem in reality...\n\n1st vent: the white conservative men who dominate my industry are ALL racist and sexist.  This isn't y the first yard I've worked on an every single construction company I have worked for has rewarded a toxic culture of verbal abuse that is usually racially or sexually/homophobically motivated.  IF any of these men AREN'T actually racist, it is impossible to tell because they ALL laugh along with the constant jokes about race and sexuality.  There is one guy who calls all the crew members \"Mexicans\" as if that's an insult and not a country.  He knows full well that NONE of them are Mexican, but they are brown so he doesn't respect them.  So he makes a point of calling them all Mexicans basically to say without saying \"Don't come at me with that we're different cultures/countries bullshit.  You're brown so I don't respect you so you're Mexicans to me.  Try to say something about it.\"  He likes to call me \"The Jew\" because I'm Jewish.  He makes comments like \"Is that Jew speak?  Let the Jew handle the money.  Is that some weird Jew custom?  Is that Jew food?\"  Like, I'm not offended by being called a Jew, but he is obviously trying to offend me.  Lord knows what he says when I'm not around.  And they all go along with it.  The crew can't talk back to him because he's higher on the food chain and everyone with any power thinks he's hilarious.\n\n2nd vent: I went to the lumber yard to pick up a unit of CDX and some guy who recognized my company vehicle asked if I was the owners wife.\n\n\"Um... No?\"\n\n\"Then what are you doing here?\"  He actually had the nerve to ask me what I was DOING there.  As if it's a private fucking club.\n\n\"Working?\"\n\n\"This is YOUR job?\"\n\n\"Um... Yeah?\"  Cue he and his counterpart literally looking me up and down and proceeding to feel very entitled to comment on my physique and \n\n\"Well, you ARE pretty fit!  You have a GREAT body!  I bet you're stronger than you look.\"  Cue me just rolling my eyes and walking away.  Like, seriously?  Is this just a thing you do to everyone or just me?\n\n3rd vent: The only men who have crossed boundaries with me have been the white conservative men.  The latinos - who are supposedly all rapists - have been nothing but respectful.  They see me driving the big rig and think it's fucking great.  The white guys make inappropriate comments to/about me all the time and one of them actually went so far as being banned from talking to me outside of email because he was sexually harrassing me in the middle of the goddamned night.  They act completely fucking shocked to see me drive the box trucks and act like I turned into a watermelon if I correctly identify a screw.  Meanwhile they all tell me to \"watch out for the Mexicans\", who are almost all Salvadorean and most of them are married and have, like, I said, been nothing but respectful.\n\nI know I chose this.  I chose to be a feminine woman in a conservative and male dominated industry.  So, may be it's my fault.  Like, I could've been a nurse or something that is more acceptable for women to do, and still probably get sexually harrassed and have to deal with assholes and fuckwads.  But, I'm not going to apologize.  There is a toxic culture of racism and sexism in this industry and me being a small attractive woman who can drive a box truck is not the problem.  The problem was already there and I love getting out of the big rig and shocking everyone in Dunn Lumber who thinks it's a private boys club.  Get used to it motherfuckers!  Women can drive box trucks and fork lifts, too motherfuckers!  Small women are mighty!  Pretty girls can be tough!  I don't have to ugly myself up to make you comfortable, I don't have to dumb myself down to make you comfortable, and being 5\"0 has never stopped me from doing ANYTHING I wanted to do.\n\nAnyways, I don't know what the answer is.  I'm just venting and I'm done now.  Thanks.",

I just watched the video of the 19-yr-old woman being harassed by a fucking creeper, and got TRIGGERED as fuck.  \n\nI'm older now, 51.  But I was a waitress/bartender for almost 30 years.  I've put up with this kind of shit, even beyond as men think they can just grab you, like grab  your body parts while they say sickening things to you.  As a server, you deflect the best you can, while still trying to \"be nice\" so you don't either get dinged on your tip or get in  trouble with your male manager, \"Just, it's not a big deal, drop it.\"\n\nOne night I was bartending alone at a ski resort, and late nights there wouldn't be too many people around.  Anyway, some dickhead decides to come *around the back of the fucking bar* to grab me with both hands around my hips and pull me in.  Yeah, also, he was there for his 13 year old daughter's ski race, she had gone to bed with her team.\n\nSo when I told him quite literally to fuck off, he pouted and acted like a victim, sat at my bar until the very end.  So I called security, which was my buddy of course (small resort) and asked if he could hang around with me to do my closing and walk me to my car.  Because...that's what you do in that situation?\n\nThe next day, I got called into the office by management because he did (security) write it up in his log.  Fair enough.  But so (all male) management calls me in to \"make sure I know they want me to feel safe\" and other platitudes like that.\n\nMy female direct boss, bar GM, pulled me aside and told me that I needed to be careful reporting \"stuff like that\", because the guys would take away my good late shifts if I made a deal about it.  They had intimated as much.  \"If she can't handle it, we can't have her working those shifts...\"\n\nI thought I handled it just fucking fine.  I took the guy's hands off me, and told him to get the hell out from behind the bar.  Continued to do my job, and had security come escort me at the end of my shift. \n\nTHE FUCK!",

    "text": "Do other black women feel similar when you personally know black men who refuse to date someone who looks like us? It kinda hurts a bit. I'm already an awkward kinda person, and I do know stats say black women and Asian men are the least desirable in the dating world. But it's like, a punch in the face when there's black men out there who refuses to even consider someone looking like you, while in the same breath want to be treated fairly, not judged and have their skin color not be an issue to the world.\n\nAnd then there's the colorism in it. \"I only go for light skinned girls/mixed.\" Everyone has preferences, but this is on par with racists who particularly don't date a specific race because [bigoted racist reason] if not worse because like.... These dudes *know* the struggle of being discriminated on and are actively doing it.\n\nI guess it's something that's been bothering me and I dunno how much it gets discussed. It just makes me feel ugly because I haven't done anything yet, black men already cross me and many women off just based off stereotypes. So much shit gets thrown in about us just by appearance alone without even saying a hi.\n\nNot quite the same, but it made me think of when I was inpatient at a hospital. Young gay black man assumed all this stuff about me just due to my appearance (dunno how because we all look beat up coming into the hospital at all times in the day) and when he actually got to know me, whole new opinion. Thought I was loud, \"ghetto\" etc while uh, I wasn't? But I know he wouldn't like it if people assumed he was in a gang, drug dealer, and likes to watch grab dicks for fun. It's a real slap in the face. But, it's nothing new for me and many other black women out there.",

    "text": "[Support] [TW] \"You're too curvy and sexy to be able to wear that to work, it's inappropriate, but.... it's okay, I'm like your mum, I'm just looking out for you.\" This is what was said to one of my female coworkers. By our female manager. \n\n\nSome background:\n\n\nShe is Nigerian, 20 years old, and this is her first job as a carer, she started less than a month ago. \n\n\nHer boss said this to her, backed by 2 other older women that are, essentially, her cronies.\nThey are in a room with an electronic keypad locked door, for which she does not know the code to escape the situatuon. She is locked in for \"privacy\".\nThis is not a meeting, nothing was documented. \n\n\nThis boss is a 40 year old Jamaican woman who has a reputation for targeting young pretty women to bully, for reasons... That I cannot fathom.\n\nThe gender and ethnic background are important because there has already been some incidents of black on black racism/tribalism in the workplace. \n\nWith one black woman viciously shouting at another black woman (originating from a different country) , accusing her of being a \"coconut\".\n\n\nIt is a **non uniform** assisted living project for learning difficulties, uniforms would be too institutionalised for our service users as they are assisted at all ages throughout their life by us to live, travel and experience activities without having attention drawn to them, just because of their need for carers. We should blend in and support, not stand out and draw attention to our service users. \nThere is no dress code, - jeans, shorts, shirts, blouses, sneakers, shoes.. As long as you're weather appropriate. \n\nWe have a high staff turnover at this care home, especially regarding young women. Many have left without ever revealing why.\n\nThis care home at every meeting says they are raising the bar of entry to new applicants, making it harder to get a job here, that new employees WILL need previous experience as we have become outbalanced by workers that have no previous experience. \n\n\nBut in action, the boss has made habit of hiring people specifically **without** experience in support work or care, or English as a first language, in order to be able to take advantage of their lack of experience and communication skills, so when asked to do something morally questionable, or tasks risky to theirs or others wellbeing without the correct or adequate equipment; the employee will simply agree and do it, without question, because they assume that their experienced superior... Knows best. \n\n\nI was told this story just today, it happened very recently. \nThe young woman who confided in me is considering leaving already because of this singular incident, that has happened less than a month after starting this new job.\n\n\nShe further confided to me that she had not long ago been a victim of rape. By her ex boyfriend. \nThe mother of the boyfriend asked her what she was wearing at the time and indicated that it was her fault for her choice of clothes. \n\nShe was wearing nightwear shorts and shirt, in the hallway of her own home.\n\n\nWhen faced with our boss and 2 other women, alone in a locked room, as they are picking apart her clothing choices and mixing reprimands of inappropriateness with.. seeming compliments?\n\nTelling her that her body is TOO curvy, and TOO sexy to be wearing THOSE clothes.\n\nBut \"it's okay, we'll let it go.. 'this one time' we're just looking out for you, I'm like your mum you know\"\n\n\nShe told me that this experience with our boss triggered the same feelings of fear when her ex boyfriend's mother blamed her for being raped. \n\n\nI can understand why she felt this way, but not fully, i don't think that as a man i will ever experience what it's like and I don't think I could ever truly be able to understand that kind fear. \n\n\nThis isn't about me.\nBut I was very angry. I couldn't believe my boss did this. \nI kept quiet, listened, and was glad i was wearing a face mask and facing partially away from her (i was driving in a work vehicle) so it hid some of the incredulous expressions my face must have been making.\n\n\nShe asked my advice and I said that I wouldn't blame her if she wanted to leave, but I encouraged her to get the company head office email from google and complain directly to HR (we don't have on site HR) \n\nI'm here because I'd like to ask 2XChromosome's advice about whether it's appropriate to make a complaint to head office myself.\n\nBut is it my place to do that?? \n\nIt feels wrong to just do nothing. \n\nHonestly, writing this all out is.. Just crazy to me.\n\nI'm starting to question if maybe I'm overreacting. \n\n\nI've written way too much, bless you if you read all of it, I've tried to provide as much context as possible. \n\n\nI could really do with some advice. \n\nEven just a sanity check.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: I forgot to say, she was wearing Sports leggings and a T-shirt.\nMany other women at work wear the same clothes without harrasment or reprimand, including the manager.\n\nNot that it should matter in this situation, but her clothes were perfectly appropriate. \nThe issue my manager had was with the young woman's body being \"too curvy\" IN those kind of clothes, which is.. Beyond inappropriate.\nHonestly. I'm still so upset and disturbed by this.\n\n\n\n\n\n       UPDATE:\n\nOkay, So I've talked with her privately and asked if she'd be comfortable with me making a complaint.\n\nI said that she shouldn't answer now, i was worried she would feel pressured in the moment to just agree with the man that's offering help.\n\nI said she should speak with her support network.\nShe then said that I am her support network, which nearly made me fucking cry. \nI asked her to please try find someone else to tell because it is so important. \nGet their opinion, ask what they think. \n\nShe got back to me and said yes and I've been writing it all up tonight.\n\nIt's like gone 4:45 am now so I'm gonna go to bed.\n\n\nI noticed a kind of unspoken theme in the comments that it was difficult to give advice somewhat because there was a question of this young women's size.\n\nI personally don't think it's an issue, i found out later that other workers saw her upset that day and they say that on that day she was covered up and not showing skin.\nThe leggings were FINE, appropriate and fine. \n\n\nBut for clarity, if it helps build a better picture- \nwe're in the UK and she's like 165cm-ish and about a size 10-12. \n\nI don't know what that is in American, and i hope it isn't offensive to reveal that about her, but I REALLY hope that knowing this makes people go:\n\n \"OH! Well... Fuck, what the hell is this managers problem?!\" \n\nFYI the manager is a size 16\nHow do i know this?\nBecause she inappropriately told us, at work, in a team meeting when discussing parts of her sex life with her divorced husband. \n\nThe way she described it, i felt like I'd been mentally flashed. \n\n\nShe. Is the worst. \n\nOkay, I gonna go now before i say more things that will get me kicked out and my post deleted. \n\nit's almost 5:00am and I'm super tired.\n\nThank you to everyone that commented.\n\nEVERYONE.\n\ngenuinely, i might not have responded much because each time i started writing a response i just felt like I was being inappropriate or disrespectful or insensitive so i deleted pretty much everything i started to write. \n\n\n\nBut i read each and every comment, all, many times.\n\nAnd it's really helped, I'm so glad i posted here.\n\n\n✌️\n\n\nThanks, you've all been so helpful and welcoming thank you all so much 🤘🤘",

    "text": "Tips on urinary tract infections (UTIs) from an unfortunate seasoned professional. Decided to post this here as I know it's a pretty common ailment for women. Through visiting a lot of different doctors and a lot of trial and error, I have managed to significantly reduce the frequency and pain of UTIs. OBLIGATORY: not a doctor, but not going to tell you to do anything weird anyway :) \n\nImportant!!! RULE #1 - if it bothers you for more than a day and is moderately painful or worse, go to the doctor and get antibiotics. Once a UTI sets in, it almost never goes away on its own and is more likely to travel up to your bladder the longer you wait. It sucks and, if you live in the US like me, it'll cost you money but if you don't you could end up in the hospital. It has happened to a friend of mine. Bottom line: get it treated when it sets in. I'm not kidding. \n\nNow, onto management and prevention. \n\nCRANBERRY - Cranberry juice is thought to help people with chronic UTIs, more in prevention than in helping a UTI after you already have them. I had doctors tell me to try and drink cranberry juice regularly. It theoretically lubricates the walls of your urethra so bacteria can't stick and multiply as easily. Doesn't make so much of a difference if you've already got a UTI. \n\nHowever, cranberry juice makes me feel sick when I drink too much of it and I don't really like the taste. Awesome alternative - cranberry pills! I try to take two a day, or if not, before (if I remember), or after sex. If I feel the very beginning of a UTI and I take them, I can feel a difference. \n\nSEX - sex, for me, and many of us, is a major cause of UTIs. Especially PIV. or probably butt stuff. But I don't have much experience with that. Anyway, --- Pee after sex. Immediately. It might kill the mood and you might be drunk or stoned or tired but DO IT ANYWAY. I made this mistake with my college boyfriend a lot and paid dearly for it. \n\nWIPING - this is stupid and the question doctors love to ask. Do you wipe front to back? Most sane people do and that's the extent of help for UTI management that I got from more than a few doctors. Just don't mix your butt germs with your pee hole. Cool? Cool. \n\nWATER - keep hydrated. Seriously. It matters. Especially if you're expecting to be sexually active. \n\nPAIN - Azo. It's an over the counter medication specifically for UTIs and it has saved me so many times. It works.  DO NOT LET THE PAIN MEDS PREVENT YOU FROM GOING TO THE DOCTOR TO GET ANTIBIOTICS. They will make you feel better. They're pain meds. You still have an infection that could become serious. They are only to help you not be miserable in the moment. They are not a treatment. It dyes your pee a weird color too so that's added fun\n\nFEELING FUNKY? gonna add a little blurb here about what I do if I feel the first inklings of a UTI coming on (slight pain). Typically, I: drink at least two glasses of water and take two cranberry pills. If my next couple of pees don't feel better, I shower.  Even if you pee out the bacteria, if they're near your pee hole they will creep back over and it will hurt again. Showering and a good wash can help that. If I keep drinking water and things start to feel worse instead of better, I take some Azo and schedule a doctor's appointment for the same day or the next day. Defeat. But often times being diligent about the above steps has helped me.  \n\nI hope this helps someone else. Most doctors will have a tip for you, but this is something I've gathered through lots of doctors visits, lots of pain, and lots of trial and error. \n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY: go to the doctor if you have a UTI. Don't wait.  I want to reiterate that. It can result in a serious infection if you let it spread.  \n\nThanks for coming to my pee talk.",

    "text": "\"It's okay, you don't have to tell me...\" (TW: mention of child abuse)\n\nFor context, I used to get night terrors due to the childhood of abuse I suffered at the hands of my father who I escaped from 3 years ago with the help of my auntie. In the last 2 years, the night terrors became less frequent and to the point where I couldn't remember the last time I had a episode so I thought I had overcome them.\n\nHowever, they have recently come back with a vengeance and I think the reason might be the news that my best friend is relocating to London to pursue her dream job hit me harder than I expected subconsciously. So, on Saturday night when I'd just moved in with my GF I had a episode of night terrors that left me drenched in sweat and struggling to breathe.\n\nThe problem was being in a unfamiliar place (we're in my GF's new flat) and still half-asleep I saw something in the darkness and I thought it was my father. At this point, I jumped out of bed and raced towards the bathroom where I started to being violently sick into the toilet. I hear footsteps coming towards the bathroom and as I'm still in full panic attack mode I thought they're my father's so I end up in the fetal position on the floor of the bathroom.\n\nNext thing I feel is my partner rubbing my back and patting my head while saying \"It's okay, you don't have tell me...we'll talk about when you want to\". I can't remember how long I lay there on the floor crying, I just know that my GF never left my side and when I was finished she helped me up so I could recover in the living room.\n\nIt took a while for the shaking to stop, my GF also gave me the wash basin to sit with as I kept dry-heaving (I don't think I had anything else to bring up TBH). I did manage to get back to sleep that night somehow and the next morning I felt terrible but I was in a better state than I had been at 3am. At breakfast, I thanked my GF for want she did and said because I have still have trouble talking about \"it\".\n\nI'm so grateful to have someone I can vulnerable around and the fact that she's happy to wait until I feel ready to talk about my past makes me feel so safe and loved, I love her so much and just wanted to share!",

    "text": "my first palliative case with an awake, oriented and fully cognitive patient. I'm sure lots of people here have had a version of this story happen countless times in their career. But this was my first time, so i thought i'd write it.\n\nAs a little forward, i've seen some 20 cases of palliative patients, they were all either congnitively absent, or so sick they lost contact with the our world.  Some were bound to die soon anyway and we just didn't want to torture them for a couple of weeks longer than they needed to.\n\n2 days ago it was very different. I received an 83 year old man with COPD since 30 years. He already had Lung cancer and Cor Pulmonale with the usual list of diseases for his age. he didn't use his machine at home for the last few days, built up some CO2, was somnolent, so his family sent him to us. His pCO2 was 120 at admission. He had the typical skin of longterm cortison therapy, mixed with the bruises of taking anticoagulants. If you look at his skin wrong it'll bleed. \n\nWe got him on the Bipap machine, underwhich he was doing better, but after 3 days he still couldn't get off of the machine without building up CO2 to 80+ in a short time, and then desatting once he's somnolent again.\n\nAfter those 3 days i wanted to call the family, let them come to talk about the therapy with them. he was already declared DNR/DNI, but we still needed to set a plan. I started by saying that I, as a Doctor and a person, would never want to live in a state where my existence long-term relies on a machine, that i'd never want to be what germans call a \"Pflegefall\" aka \"Nursing-case\" (meaning heavily reliant on care from other people). We already know he's DNR/DNI, but we need further planning in case he never gets off the machine.\n\nThey tell me he also never wanted to be a \"nursing case\", i told them to go talk to him as a family, after some time i'd go there and talk to them. In such cases i always try to tell the family that they are not making the decision (because its too much to ask from them imo), i tell them they are helping US make the decision that would be best for the patient. i feel this takes the edge off.\n\nafter some time, i call on the family, and we go to a seperate room. they tell me they all agreed, they want to turn the Bipap off.\n\ntbh that took me by surprise. I didn't expect that they'd want to do that now. I asked them if they knew what implication that has. they said he'd die. they explained that his visits to the hospital are more frequent, time between hospital visits is shorter, and his in-Patient time is longer. At home he also couldn't be off the machine for a long time. so he flat out refused it for the last few days.\n\nI told them i'll have to discuss this with my consultant, but if everything goes as planned, i'll fullfill his wish, and make sure he is as comfortable as possible. they asked me how it will go once i turn the machine off, which is a question i received often now. I explain that without the machine he'll find it harder to breathe, but we'll manage his distress with morphin, and make sure he is as comfortable as possible. At some point he will sleep, and then just... go. I also explained that it would all happen relatively quickly.\n\nAnd then i sent them on their way, and went to talk with the patient himself. he was still under the BIPAP, he was awake, and oriented. his skin was leaking serous fluid at this point.\n\nHis name is COPD Patient, but we've grown close in the last few days so i like to just call him COPD.\n\n- COPD, did you just talk with your family?\n\n Nods yes\n\n- did you all agree on a decision?\n\n Nods yes\n\n- Do you want this BIPAP machine?\n\n Nods no\n\n- Do you know what would happen if we took you off the machine?\n\n Motions his own beheading with his hand\n\n- and you want us to do this?\n\n Nods yes\n\n- alright. we'll make sure you're as comfortable as possible in the mean time. we'll take care of it.\n\nSo i call my consultant, i explained the situation briefly, and she said \"Do it\". I asked if there is any procedure i should follow? if there is anything else to it but just literally going there and turning the machine off. She said no, Document everything in the chart, then go and turn the machine off. which felt a bit too.. underwhelming? for such a case and such an action on an awake patient.\n\nI've seen many palliatives, but this was the first time in my life that an awake person, with all his mental and cognitive capacity, without being septic or on 3 different pressors with an infaust prognosis, tells me they want to die.\n\nI turned the machine off, give him a morphin perfusor, and slowly escalated it. Without the machine he could be heard again, so he told me, taking breaks between sentences:\n\n\"I've battled this fucking disease.... for 30 years, now... now its enough\"\n\nAt the very end of my shift, while still under morphine, he asked me for an Oxygen mask.\n\nEven though its against procedure i gave him the mask, i didn't find it in me to tell him \"no..too late! you die without oxygen\". so i put him on a little bit of oxygen and then go home.\n\nHe survived the 12 Hours till the start of my next shift, and died 1 hour after its beginning. I hope i never experience it again.",

    "text": "The USA's Status Quo Has Got To Go (And How You Can Bring Change) This is a message written to every physician, nurse, aide, tech, and (most importantly), patient.\n\n**TL;DR:** While practicing medicine in the US may equip you with some of the most advanced technologies and treatments available, there are a number of barriers that render these advances inaccessible to many of our patients.  I'm going to try to outline some of these areas of weakness, and close by summarizing steps we can take to fix our system *for our patients.* Change is going to take all of us.\n\n# High Cost But Poor Value: The US Healthcare System Today\n\nOur patients experience insufficient access to care.\n\n[The US spends a much higher percentage of its gross domestic product (GDP) on health care than other wealthy countries](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-271.html).  However, the US performs poorly on many quality measures compared to other countries, including avoidable hospitalizations and deaths.  Why practice medicine, if we can't *get access* to help our patients?\n\n On a per capita basis, the U.S. spends more than double the $3,453 average of all OECD countries.\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.dpeaflcio.org\\/factsheets\\/the-us-health-care-system-an-international-perspective](https://preview.redd.it/wi3ii0hlvle71.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=28b7b0793319f64994e52338060e34834c3157e9)\n\n[**Health care access, quality, cost, and outcomes vary** between different regions and states within the US.](https://www.medicare.gov/)  For example, [12 states did not expand their Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act of 2010](https://www.medicaid.gov/), creating a coverage gap for people in these states who do not qualify for either Medicaid or subsidies with the purchase of private health insurance. Further, [prices for an identical health care service can vary dramatically by region](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Healthcare-Financial-Management-Seventh/dp/1567937063). (Read about this USA Today article on the same care in [different states](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/01/health-exchange-prices/3797039/), as an example). There is [no universal health care coverage](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/international-health-policy-center/system-features/how-does-universal-health-coverage-work), and a [significant number of individuals do not have health insurance](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/pdf/265041/trends-in-the-us-uninsured.pdf). This disparity causes [earlier onset of illness, more severe disease, poorer quality of care, and a significantly reduced lifespan in those affected by poor social determinants of health.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425844/)\n\n# [Overall quality of care, by state, 2014-2015](https://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/nhqrdr/nhqdr16/overview.html)\n\n[ Some states in the Midwest \\(Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Wisconsin\\) and some in the Northeast \\(Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island\\) had the highest overall quality scores. Scores were based on the number of measures that were better, same, or worse than the national average for each measure. Many Southern and Southwestern states \\(Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia\\), several Western states \\(Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming\\), and one Midwestern state \\(Indiana\\) had the lowest overall quality scores.](https://preview.redd.it/cebbev6esle71.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fc8ec5045f8f8874cf462a1083d189f5cc8ce32)\n\n# [Average differences in quality of care for Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians compared with Whites, by state, 2014-2015](https://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/nhqrdr/nhqdr16/overview.html)\n\n[ Some Western and Midwestern states \\(Idaho, Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming and several Southern states \\(Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia\\) had the fewest racial and ethnic disparities overall. Several Northeastern states \\(Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania\\), some Midwestern states \\(Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin\\), one Southern state \\(North Carolina\\), one Southwestern state \\(Texas\\), and one Western state \\(Arizona\\) had the most racial and ethnic disparities overall.](https://preview.redd.it/giujjwfssle71.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6e0b7d0d79caec7788ef9565f9a2681ec2cf139)\n\nAccording to the [US Census Bureau reports](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-271.pdf) published in September 2020, 8% (26.1 million) of Americans did not have health insurance during 2019. 92% of Americans had health insurance coverage during 2019 (68% via private insurance, and 34.1% via public insurance). Now, [around 30 million people in the US remain uninsured](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/). Many more are underinsured, with [half of US adults reporting having delayed or skipped medical care due to costs.](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/)  Why? Well, for example... The average cost of an inpatient admission was [$25,000 in 2018](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/global-payments-to-health-providers.aspx). Common and essential drugs, such as insulin and epinephrine autoinjectors, can cost hundreds of dollars each. [Drug prices in the U.S. are twice as high as in other countries](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/prescription-drug-prices-in-the-u-s-are-twice-as-high-heres-why). Experts say brand-name drugs are the main driver of higher prices, and note that actual out-of-pocket costs is difficult to gauge. (This is beyond the scope of today's post).\n\n[ In 2015, the U.S. spent $325 billion on retail prescription drugs, equivalent to 1.8&#37; of GDP, or 10&#37; of total national health expenditures. Spending has grown considerably since the 1980s ](https://preview.redd.it/6hvld691tle71.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0da12f78ca2b33d95765e3d8da63099514c09e9)\n\n[The U.S. spends substantially more per capita than other countries. According to the OECD, the U.S. spent $1,112 on retail pharmaceuticals per person in 2014, while the next highest spender was Canada, at $772, followed by Germany at $741 and France at $659. ](https://preview.redd.it/hbb2lhh2tle71.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba1ef0ad5d392620caa5749cd09dcb2adcee6c0)\n\n[Source](https://www.bruegel.org/2017/08/the-issue-of-u-s-prescription-drug-prices/) \n\nPolicymakers aren't going to require changes without pressure from a coordinated movement.  You can use the [social determinants of health](https://www.cdc.gov/socialdeterminants/index.htm) as an example of how our system is failing. These political, cultural, and socioeconomic conditions into which individuals are born and with which they live impact health.  We have found that one's education, the environment, nutrition, wealth distribution, gender, race, and/or access to health care [are not very well addressed in the current system](https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/welcome-ad?toURL=/clinical-care/5-ways-healthcare-organizations-can-address-social-determinants-health). Do you know anyone affected by any of these?\n\n# The US population has a higher chronic disease burden than other 1st world countries, yet spends more money than other countries\n\n[https:\\/\\/mpkb.org\\/home\\/pathogenesis\\/epidemiology](https://preview.redd.it/dvmyxaixule71.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d943fec8695a704a17c6c7bb728e165320cecb0)\n\nHow embarrassing! US politicians, health care administrators, and investors are failing us. Most would argue that a just and equitable health care system benefits a society as a whole.  You can measure that by looking at chronic disease burden. How are we doing? \n\n[28% of US adults report](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-271.html) having been diagnosed with two or more chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) in their life, compared to an average of 18% of adults in other wealthy countries.  [This is a huge red flag about a failing system, but the causes are beyond the scope of today's post (you can read more about them here).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5876976/)\n\n[https:\\/\\/mpkb.org\\/home\\/pathogenesis\\/epidemiology](https://preview.redd.it/txbpns0evle71.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfa73dd0f49a3f8b08051eac456ad91c5ac19920)\n\nA just and equitable system ensures certain standards of public health that, in turn, [reduce the burden of disease on the entire population.](https://health.usnews.com/health-care/for-better/articles/the-case-for-universal-health-care) (This is [how universal health care pays for itself](https://www.healthcare-now.org/blog/how-single-payer-health-care-pays-for-itself/)). Accordingly, a health care system should strive to provide access and treatment to all population groups regardless of identity and socioeconomic status, while ensuring that underprivileged groups are not ignored.\n\nRecognizing and addressing inequalities due to social health determinants can improve the health of the most vulnerable and at-risk groups. For example, [social justice](https://www.apha.org/what-is-public-health/generation-public-health/our-work/social-justice) in health care is the delivery of high-quality and fair treatment, regardless of an individual's age, race, ethnicity, economic status, disability, or sexual orientation.\n\n# What can be done about all of this?\n\nThe most important step is to learn how our system (and specifically it's failings) are influencing the health of our patients.  We must acknowledge and address our role in changing it.  We need to look at how other countries allocate resources in ways that benefit more people (e.g., set up a budget inclusive of underserved populations). We need to provide training to ensure health care providers are culturally competent and advocate for patient rights.  We also need to create diverse care delivery models.\n\n# It starts with each of us.\n\n**You can** help fix the illogical things the USA is doing in medicine, medical education, and healthcare policy without sacrificing as much as you think. Where to start? Talk to each other. Share your goals, struggles, and challenges. Join together. Drop the poisonous attitudes, the fights, and the competition. Smell the roses. It just takes some common sense, optimism, communication, and compromise. It takes all of us working for our patients.\n\n**Today, I'm hoping to encourage all of you to** seek progress. We need to acknowledge this responsibility before things worsen. Perhaps you're discouraged, isolated, and overworked. You're not alone. We are waiting for others to fix medicine, but it's got to be us.  The status quo has got to go. How will you stand up to it?\n\n[Healthcare workers \\(and our patients\\) need to get more active in politics. ](https://preview.redd.it/c71gv3x4sle71.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f3e7ca0da93541a075af89a3210db36b8ccd43e)",

    "text": "Here is a review our the complexity of the US healthcare system The US health care system consists of a multitude of subsystems and is subject to different regulations in different states. There is no universal health care coverage, and a significant number of individuals do not have health insurance. When people say our system is broken, they are most likely referring to the high cost and complexity that continues to yield poor outcomes. According to the US Census Bureau reports published in September 2020: 8% (26.1 million) of Americans did not have health insurance during 2019. 92% of Americans had health insurance coverage during 2019 (68% via private insurance and 34.1% via public insurance).\n\nIf we are going to change the system, we must first understand it. That is the entire purpose of this post.\n\n# The US healthcare system\n\nHealth insurance may be funded by the state (e.g., Medicare), employers, individuals, or a combination thereof. There are two widely used health insurance payment models, which are used by both public and private health insurance systems: fee-for-service and value-based performance models. \n\nGovernment-funded health insurance: any of the federal social healthcare programs enacted with the revisions to the Social Security Act aimed at providing health insurance to specific groups\n\n#### Medicare \n\n* **Eligibility**\n* Individuals ≥ 65 years old \n* Patients with end-stage renal failure or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n* Individuals with permanent disabilities **irrespective** of age\n* **Parts**: The two main coverage options are Original Medicare (part A and part B) and Medicare Advantage (part C). Individuals also have the option of adding part D to their main coverage.\n* Part A: hospital care, hospice care for terminal patients, skilled nursing facility care (if services are needed daily after a minimum 3-day stay in a hospital)\n* Part B: doctors' fees, emergency department visits, diagnostic tests, rehabilitation\n* Part C (Medicare Advantage Plan): all services covered by parts A and B, plus a private insurance plan\n* “All in one” plan that allows people to enroll in a private health insurance plan approved by Medicare\n* Medicare pays other organizations, e.g., insurance companies, hospital systems, and managed care organizations, to provide care.\n* Part D: prescription drugs \n\n#### Medicaid \n\n* **Funds**: jointly funded by the state and federal government\n* **Eligibility**\n* Nonfinancial\n* Beneficiaries must be American citizens or lawful permanent residents.\n* Individuals must live in the state in which they receive their coverage.\n* Financial: households with an income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level (which includes individuals, families, and pregnant women)\n* All low-income Americans < 65 years of age\n* Children at 133% of the federal poverty level are covered in every state.\n* Coverage for adults with an income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level is decided by each state.\n* **Coverage**: hospital care, laboratory tests, diagnostic tests (such as x-rays), doctors' visits, skilled nursing care, vaccinations, home health care\n\n#### Children's health insurance program (CHIP)\n\n* **Eligibility**: uninsured children of families with low income, but not low enough to qualify for Medicaid\n\n### Private health insurance\n\n* Used by more than half of the American population\n* May be employer-sponsored (most common) , college-sponsored, or purchased individually\n\n### Self-pay patient \n\n* Individuals who pay out-of-pocket for a health care service and do not have any third-party coverage from a government entity (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid), private health care insurer, or plan\n* Typically includes patients who:\n* Cannot or do not want to pay a fixed monthly premium\n* Have chronic or preexisting conditions not covered by an insurance company\n\n### Health insurance premium\n\n* **Definition**: a payment made to the health insurance provider, typically monthly. Premiums usually depend on the policy type and individual risk.\n* **Characteristics**\n* The premium depends on the type of policy and individual factors (e.g., individual or family plan).\n* The deductible, copayments, and coinsurance are paid separately.\n* It can be paid by individuals (monthly), an employer, or both.\n* If individuals receive insurance through an employer, they pay the premium through payroll deductions.\n* Generally, plans with a higher premium will have lower out-of-pocket expenses (i.e., a lower deductible and copayments).\n\n### Out-of-pocket expenses\n\n* **Definition**: payments made by individuals to their insurance company, including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments\n* **Out-of-pocket maximum**\n* An annual limit on the amount of money that an individual has to pay for covered health care services in a year (not including premiums)\n* After this amount is reached, all covered health services are paid in full by the health plan for the rest of that plan year.\n* Payments that apply to the deductible, copays, and [coinsurance](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Np0-pS#Z6f7d0c999a703be7e1584990b30000c4) also apply to the out-of-pocket maximum.\n\n### Deductible \n\n* **Definition**: a predetermined amount paid out of pocket by the patient before the insurance company begins to pay\n* **Types of** **deductible**\n* Comprehensive deductible: applies to and includes all areas of coverage of the health insurance policy\n* Noncomprehensive deductible\n* Applies to specific areas of coverage or medical expenses in a health insurance policy\n* Not all medical areas of coverage in the plan have a deductible.\n* Individual deductible: a deductible that each individual in the plan pays\n* Family deductible: a deductible that usually applies to two or more individuals\n* Embedded deductible\n* Two deductible amounts within one insurance plan (individual and family)\n* Each member contributes the same amount towards meeting the deductible.\n* Once a member of the plan meets the deductible, the individual becomes eligible for copayment and coinsurance (out-of-pocket expenses).\n* True family deductible\n* Members can meet the deductible by pooling expenses.\n* Can be met by all members or just one member of the family\n* There is no limit to the amount each member can pay towards meeting the family deductible.\n* Once the deductible is met, the entire family is eligible for copayment and coinsurance.\n* **Characteristics**\n* Typically annual\n* After the deductible is paid, the individual usually only pays for copayment or coinsurance for covered services.\n* Generally, plans with lower monthly premiums have higher deductibles and vice versa.\n* If the individual is healthy and does not expect costly medical services: higher deductible and lower premium\n* If the individual has a medical condition and expects costly medical services: lower deductible and higher premium\n* **Example**: A $2,000 deductible means the individual needs to pay $2,000 in medical expenses. After reaching that amount, the insurance provider covers the remainder.\n\n### Copayment \n\n* **Definition**: a **fixed amount** paid by the patient to a health service provider at the time of the service (e.g., doctor's appointment, filling of a prescription)\n* **Characteristics**\n* Typically defined in the insurance policy\n* Paid each time the patient receives medical services\n* The amount can vary by the type of service (e.g., prescription drugs, lab tests).\n* Meant to discourage individuals from seeking unnecessary medical care\n* Sometimes counts towards meeting the deductible\n* Generally, plans with lower monthly premiums have higher copayments and vice versa.\n* **Example**: a health insurance plan that allows a doctor's appointment cost of $100 and sets the copayment for this service at $20\n* If the individual has not reached the deductible, they will pay the full amount for the visit ($100).\n* If the individual has reached the deductible, they will pay $20 at the time of the visit.\n\n### Coinsurance \n\n* **Definition**: a payment of a predetermined **percentage** made to the insurance provider after the individual has met the deductible\n* **Characteristics**\n* Refers to the individual's share of the costs of a health care service\n* Must be paid before any policy benefit is paid by the insurance company\n* This applies to covered services and is paid in addition to the copayment.\n* Typically paid after the individual meets the deductible\n* Billed by the provider directly to the individual\n* Generally, plans with low monthly premiums have higher coinsurance and vice versa.\n* **Example**: If an insurance plan covers 85% of the costs, the individual is responsible for the remaining 15% (this 15% is the coinsurance).\n\n### Health insurance network (preferred providers) \n\n* **Definition**: a group of health care providers, suppliers, and facilities that have a contract to provide services to members of health insurance plans at a discounted rate\n* **In-network**\n* A health care professional, hospital, and/or service provider who has a contract with the insurance company to provide services at a discounted price\n* In-network copayment and coinsurance usually cost less than out-of-network copayment and coinsurance.\n* Exclusive provider organization (EPO) and health maintenance organization (HMO) plans only cover in-network care, except in the case of a medical emergency.\n* **Out-of-network**\n* A health care professional, hospital, and/or service provider who does not have a contract with the insurance company to provide services at a discounted price\n* Out-of-network copayment and coinsurance usually cost more than in-network copayment and coinsurance.\n* Preferred provider organization (PPO) plans may have out-of-network care coverage. However, the out-of-pocket cost for out-of-network care may be significantly higher than for in-network care.\n\n### Health care payment models \n\n* **Fee-for-service**\n* Health care providers are compensated by the insurer and/or patient for **each individual** **service** provided (e.g., individual laboratory tests, imaging studies, procedures).\n* Dominant payment model in the US\n* Incentivizes health care providers to overtreat patients because compensation is based on the number of services provided\n* Associated with high overall health care costs\n* Discounted fee-for-service\n* A fixed payment schedule with discounted prices negotiated between health care providers and payers for each individual service\n* Often used by PPOs\n* Per diem payment (per day payment)\n* A fixed amount per patient per day paid to the health care provider for a specific care service provided, regardless of the actual costs involved in providing services for a particular patient.\n* Often used for reimbursement of inpatient services\n* The rates are typically stratified. A hospital can be paid different rates depending on the service provided (e.g., a hospital is paid a rate for a surgical day and a higher rate for a critical care unit day).\n* **Capitation**\n* Health care **practitioners** are compensated a **fixed amount** by the insurer during each payment period, regardless of the actual amount of health care services utilized by the patient.\n* Often used by HMOs\n* The payment period is usually monthly.\n* Incentivizes health care providers to deliver efficient care (e.g., cost-effective preventive health care to avoid larger downstream costs) \n* Carries the risk that patients will be undertreated because compensation is not based on the quantity or quality of services provided\n* **Global payment** \n* The insurer makes a **single**, **fixed payment** to a health care organization for the needs of a **population of patients** (i.e., enrollees in a health plan) during a specified time period (e.g., monthly or yearly) for expenses associated with an incident of care.\n* Usually paid to a single health care organization\n* Covers a wide range of services: typically includes physician fees, hospital services, tests, prescription drugs, and other services, such as follow-up visits\n* Often used for nonurgent surgery, with the coverage extending to all costs associated with the pre- and postoperative visits\n* Incentivizes health care providers to coordinate, deliver efficient care, and keep expenses low \n* Holds providers fully accountable for compensated services\n* **Bundled payment** \n* The insurer makes a **fixed payment** to a health care organization for **all** services provided for a **clinically-defined** **episode** of care (e.g., hip replacement, cholecystectomy).\n* The compensation is distributed among all health care providers involved in the care of the patient during that defined episode.\n* Incentivizes health care providers to deliver coordinated and efficient care (e.g., health care providers avoid unnecessary procedures, duplicate tests)\n* Typically based on the estimated cost of all of the services a patient would require during a single medical treatment episode or procedure\n* Example: a payment beginning 2 days prior to a knee replacement surgery and extending 30 days past a patient’s discharge from the hospital for this procedure \n* **Pay for performance** (P4P)\n* A payment model in which compensation depends on health care providers meeting certain metrics for the quality and efficiency of care provided\n* Calculated using specific measures of quality and by determining the overall health of populations\n* Providers are required to report specific metrics (e.g., safety, clinical care, efficiency and cost reduction, and patient and caregiver-centered experience) to payers and demonstrate improvement.\n* Providers typically track and report data on hospital readmissions, adverse events, population health, and patient engagement.\n* Improves value and quality of care by encouranging adherence to clinical guidelines and proven best practices (move from volume to value and better outcomes) through financial incentives\n* Motivates health care providers to protect and improve their reputation; improves accountability and transparency\n* Disadvantages\n* Reimbursement issues: Medicare penalizes hospitals with poor performance.\n* Payments are reduced by 2% and the funds are redistributed if the provider's performance or quality of care measures are unsatisfactory.\n* Hospitals with high readmission rates for specific episodes of care (i.e., myocardial infarction, heart failure, COPD, pneumonia) have their payments reduced by up to 3%.\n* Hospitals in the bottom quartile of performance based on nosocomial conditions with high readmission rates (e.g., CLABSI, CAUTI, surgical site infections, MRSA, C. difficile infections) have their payments reduced by 1%.\n* High administrative costs to gather data\n* Reduces access for socioeconomically disadvantaged patients: Health practitioners may not be incentivized to treat these patients, as they may have difficulty attending follow-ups and paying for treatment, which may lower performance on [P4P](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/Np0-pS#Zbe811f74584ee59e119ec69dbd9aec47) measures.\n\n  \nUS Congress and state legislatures have implemented a number of policies in attempts to extend and guarantee access to health care.\n\n### Emergency medical treatment and labor act (EMTALA) \n\n* **Definition**: an act passed by Congress in 1986 that requires emergency departments to evaluate, treat, and stabilize patients presenting with emergency medical conditions (including [labor](https://next.amboss.com/us/article/3O0SHT#Z6ef73f19366e47d24a7b927f1f58d045)) regardless of the patient's ability to pay for the treatment provided\n* **Aims**\n* Ensure public access to emergency services\n* Reduce the incidence of patient dumping and inappropriate discharging\n* Prevent refusal to treat indigent patients\n* **Characteristics**\n* Hospitals cannot refuse emergency treatment for any reason, including age, sex, religious affiliation, or other characteristics.\n* Hospitals should not obtain prior authorization from the insurance company before screening or stabilizing a patient.\n* Hospitals can be held liable for injuries or deaths that result from refusing to admit or treat a patient.\n* **Disadvantages**\n* EMTALA has led to inappropriate use of the emergency department by uninsured patients and subsequent overcrowding.\n* Negatively affects the efficiency and type of services provided (e g., prolonged waiting times, stressful therapeutic environments, poor clinical outcomes)\n* Reimbursement issues \\[22\\]\n* Health plans deny or reduce payments, claiming:\n* Treatment was not medically necessary.\n* The individual did not have an emergency condition.\n* Treatment was provided at an out-of-network hospital.\n* The number of physicians willing to serve in emergency departments has declined due to uncompensated care.\n* Hospitals are closing emergency departments and are under increasing financial strain: Hospitals made up for uncompensated care by charging more for services for the insured.

    "text": "Megathread #58: SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Month of February 2021. COVID-19 Megathread #58\n\nThis is a megathread to consolidate discussion about the COVID-19 outbreak. This thread is a place for discussion, personal anecdotes of providing COVID care, brief updates, and professional questions about the epidemiology and management of COVID-19. Reputable sources (not unverified twitter posts!) are still requested to support any new claims about the outbreak.\n\nWe will be hosting a new megathread periodically depending on developments/content. The latest thread will always be stickied and will provide the most up-to-date information. If you just posted something in the previous thread right before it got unstickied and your question wasn't answered/your point wasn't discussed, feel free to repost it in the latest one. If the active COVID megathread isn't stickied, please notify the moderators [by modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/medicine) with a link to the thread.\n\n# Background and summary\n\nOn December 31st 2019, Chinese authorities reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. A novel zoonotic virus was suspected and discovered, now named SARS-CoV-2. The syndrome of viral pneumonia caused by this virus -- sometimes associated with abnormal coagulation parameters, anosmia, anorexia, renal failure, and/or gastrointestinal distress -- has been termed COVID-19.\n\nDespite extreme public health interventions at the first epicenter in Hubei province, China, the outbreak has become a global pandemic. Several factors have made for explosive spread of SARS-CoV-2: the human population is immunologically naive, the virus has a long incubation period and can be asymptomatically spread, and is highly infectious, with an rate of transmission significantly higher than epidemic influenza. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has proven deadly as well, with case fatality rate (CFR) estimates ranging between 0.1 to 1% or more. To date, an estimated 63 million people have been infected and some 1.5 million people have lost their lives in a confirmed case of COVID-19 since December 2019. The true numbers are suspected to be higher.\n\nThe effect of the pandemic on the healthcare system has been extreme, with cases overwhelming normal operations of hospitals during the initial surge in a number of regions, leading to staff exposure, illness, and in some cases, death. This was exacerbated by worldwide shortages in medical equipment, particularly personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers; shortages are still present in many parts of the world including the United States. Rationing of healthcare resources has been widely discussed, and in some areas implemented, creating agonizing decisions for doctors and families.\n\nHealthcare organizations have also been starved of usual revenue, and despite an overwhelming demand for healthcare in some specialties and regions, other medical practices are seeing massive drops in income. Furloughs and pay cuts are becoming common across the American medical landscape. Telehealth visits are becoming common, and practices inside the hospital in many regions have completely transformed. In dense cities that have been handling an onslaught of patients for months, many frontline staff (ER, general medicine, ICU, etc) are physically and emotionally fatigued, yet still face a hazardous working environment.\n\nAlthough some regions of the United States, Europe and Asia have been able to control the spread of COVID-19 with combinations of business shutdowns, shelter-in-place/quarantine orders, mandatory mask usage, and social distancing protocols, spread has accelerated in other regions of the United States, Brazil, Russia, and India among other areas. Public health interventions remain controversial in many areas, and particularly in the United States, have become politicized and rejected by many.\n\nMedical science has struggled to keep pace with the spread of the virus. Despite a number of hastily executed clinical trials, few agents have been found to have any clinical effect on COVID-19 outcomes. Dexamethasone has emerged as the only treatment so far with a [demonstrated mortality benefit](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/low-cost-dexamethasone-reduces-death-by-up-to-one-third-in-hospitalised-patients-with-severe-respiratory-complications-of-covid-19) in patients requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilator support. In milder disease, remdesivir has been used, although with more mixed evidence. In outpatients, some monoclonal antibodies have shown reduction in subsequent hospitalization. Misinformation and partial information (such as leaks of interim clinical trial data) are rife. Clinical treatment algorithms have swung wildly based on small case series, anecdotes and conjecture, though a shaky consensus for critical supportive care is starting to emerge. Virologists, immunologists, and others have pivoted their usual research and an impressive number of preprints have been generated. However, enormous questions remain, such as the nature of post-infectious immunity.\n\nAs of December 2020, several vaccines across the world have received emergency use authorization, and vaccination has begun. Data on effectiveness and safety has been encouraging so far. Several virus variants have appeared around the globe with concern for increased infectious spread and risk that they will render vaccines ineffective before they have even been rolled out widely.\n\n# Subreddits:\n\n* [r/medicinememorial - memorial pages for health care workers who died in the global fight against COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicinememorial/)\n* [r/Coronavirus - general news and discussion about the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/)\n* [r/COVID19 - academic papers and press releases relating to COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/)\n\n# Tracking/Maps/Modeling:\n\n* [JHU CSSE](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)\n* [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)\n* [Worldometer case tracker](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)\n* [Coronawiki case tracker](https://www.coronawiki.org/)\n* [New York Times case tracker and map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)\n* [BNO News case tracker and map](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/04/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)\n* [Wikipedia COVID-19 information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)\n* [CDC death forecasts](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html)\n* [IHME projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america)\n* [University of Texas Modeling Consortium](https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/projections/)\n\n# Resources from Organizational Bodies\n\n* [WHO Daily Sitreps](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports)\n* [ECDC Latest](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china)\n* [USA CDC Latest](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\n* [Promed](https://promedmail.org/coronavirus/)\n* [Imperial MRC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)\n* [CDC Info for health professionals](https://bit.ly/2T80VBd)\n* [LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/research-action/covid-19)\n* [WHO Technical Guidance](https://bit.ly/2vo9DSM)\n* [AMA resource center for health professionals](https://bit.ly/395aNkO)\n* [ACP Information for Internists](https://bit.ly/2T99Rqc)\n* [CDC Pandemic Preparedness Resources](https://bit.ly/2whQmCU)\n* [UpToDate COVID-19](https://bit.ly/2Tphyam)\n* [EMCrit](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/COVID19/)\n* [SCCM](https://www.sccm.org/covid19)\n* [RCoA/ICS](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/)\n* [Intensive Blog](https://intensiveblog.com/covid-19/)\n* [NICE Guidance](https://www.nice.org.uk/covid-19)\n* [ICU Net](https://covid19-icu.net/)\n* [EMRAP](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/rec906m1mD6SRH9np/Novel-Coronavirus-2019-COVID-19?SearchType=%22text%22)\n\n# Reminders\n\nThis subreddit is heavily moderated and comments may be removed without warning.

    "text": "So...how does General Practice work for you guys in the USA? Hi all.\n\nReading through the threads here, what grabs my interest most is the way that GP (Family Practice?) works in the USA. I read through a thread where the poster was asking about the scope of practice for GPs that have done Obs and Gynae training as part of their GP training and they're talking about doing C sections?!\n\nHere in the UK, the division is clear.\n\nFinish your three years of GP training (usually one surgical job, one medical job (any specialty - cardio / resp / gastro / gerries / acute med), one paeds job and an obs and gynae job, maybe with ED or psych thrown in) and you're a GP that works almost exclusively in the community.\n\nOn instagram (I know, I know...), some of the doctors I follow talk about admitting patients to the hospital and then doing ward rounds on them as part of their practice - this could never happen in the UK. When the patient is admitted, your input ends and you hand over care to the hospital team. After they're discharged, they're essentially 'handed back' to you - but you don't get any input on their hospital management, just as the hospital doctors won't have any input on their community management (to an extent).\n\nSome GPs will do locum shifts in their local ED, and some develop a 'Special Interest' - eg GP with Derm or GP with Obs and Gynae, but they'd be doing things like managing chronic skin conditions or putting in coils - I don't think a GP would ever do a section here, unless super super rural.\n\nSo...how does family practice work for you guys? Do you get a mix of hospital work? What are the limits to what you're allowed to do?!",

    "text": "I came across a field manual from the CIA on how to sabotage an organization, and now I am convinced admin is one giant covert op. (a) Organizations and Conferences\n\n(1) Insist on doing everything through \"channels.\" Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to, expedite decisions.\n\n(2) Make \"speeches.\" Talk as frequently as possible and at great length. Illustrate your \"points\" by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate \"patriotic\" comments.\n\n(3) When possible, refer all matters to committees, for \"further study and consideration.\" Attempt to make the committees as large as possible - never less than five.\n\n(4) Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.\n\n(5) Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.\n\n(6) Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to reopen the question of the advisability of that decision.\n\n(7) Advocate \"caution.\" Be \"reasonable\" and urge your fellow-conferees to be \"reasonable\" and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.\n\n(8) Be worried about the propriety of any decision -raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon.\n\n\n\n(b) Managers and Supervisors\n\n(1) Demand written orders.\n\n(2) \"Misunderstand\" orders. Ask endless questions or engage in long correspondence about such orders. Quibble over them when you can.\n\n(3) Do everything possible to delay the delivery of orders. Even though parts of an order may be ready beforehand, don't deliver it until it is completely ready.\n\n(4) Don't order new working materials until your current stocks have been virtually exhausted, so that the slightest delay in filling your order will mean a shutdown.\n\n(5) Order high-quality materials which are hard to get. If you don't get them argue about it. Warn that inferior materials will mean inferior work.\n\n(6) In making work assignments, always sign out the unimportant jobs first. See that the important jobs are assigned to inefficient workers of poor machines.\n\n(7) Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products; send back for refinishing those which have the least flaw. Approve other defective parts whose flaws are not visible to the naked eye.\n\n(8) Make mistakes in routing so that parts and materials will be sent to the wrong place in the plant.\n\n(9) When training new workers, give incomplete or misleading instructions.\n\n(10) To lower morale and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions. Discriminate against efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.\n\n(11) Hold conferences when there is more critical work to be done.\n\n(12) Multiply paper work in plausible ways. Start duplicate files.\n\n(13) Multiply the procedures and clearances involved in issuing instructions, pay checks, and so on. See that three people have to approve everything where one would do.\n\n(14) Apply all regulations to the last letter.\n\n\n\n\n￼\n\n(c) Office Workers\n\n(1) Make mistakes in quantities of material when you are copying orders. Confuse similar names. Use wrong addresses.\n\n(2) Prolong correspondence with government bureaus.\n\n(3) Misfile essential documents.\n\n(4) In making carbon copies, make one too few, so that an extra copying job will have to be done.\n\n(5) Tell important callers the boss is busy or talking on another telephone.\n\n(6) Hold up mail until the next collection.\n\n(7) Spread disturbing rumors that sound like inside dope.\n\n(d) Employees\n\n(1) Work slowly. Think out ways to increase the number of movements necessary on your job: use a light hammer instead of a heavy one, try to make a small wrench do when a big one is necessary, use little force where considerable force is needed, and so on.\n\n(2) Contrive as many interruptions to your work as you can: when changing the material on which you are working, as you would on a lathe or punch, take needless time to do it. If you are cutting, shaping or doing other measured work, measure dimensions twice as often as you need to. When you go to the lavatory, spend a longer time there than is necessary. Forget tools so that you will have to go back after them.\n\n(3) Even if you understand the language, pretend not to understand instructions in a foreign tongue.\n\n(4) Pretend that instructions are hard to understand, and ask to have them repeated more than once. Or pretend that you are particularly anxious to do your work, and pester the foreman with unnecessary questions.\n\n(5) Do your work poorly and blame it on bad tools, machinery, or equipment. Complain that these things are preventing you from doing your job right.\n\n(6) Never pass on your skill and experience to a new or less skillful worker.\n\n(7) Snarl up administration in every possible way. Fill out forms illegibly so that they will have to be done over; make mistakes or omit requested information in forms.\n\n(8) If possible, join or help organize a group for presenting employee problems to the management. See that the procedures adopted are as inconvenient as possible for the management, involving the presence of a large number of employees at each presentation, entailing more than one meeting for each grievance, bringing up problems which are largely imaginary, and so on.\n\n(9) Misroute materials.\n\n(10) Mix good parts with unusable scrap and rejected parts.\n\n\n\n\nhttp://svn.cacert.org/CAcert/CAcert_Inc/Board/oss/oss_sabotage.html",

    "text": "Pls stop taking out your frustration about your shitty assignment on the off-going nurse Rant because I actually had a perfectly good shift until day shift got there and it ruined how I felt about my entire shift. \nMy total care patient was turned and repositioned q2, my meds were passed on time, and I even had time so read some notes with 5 patients at night.  Everyone remained safe and healthy and the vitals were stable all around and people were comfortable and sleeping. \nDay shift gets there and there are quite a few strong personalities in this mix. Not sure if it just the culture of the floor, or if it’s because it’s an oncology med/surg and it just attracts very type A people, but already I’m getting sighs and eye rolls in report. For what?? Because I didn’t know why that patient who is being discharged to a SNF and has been here for weeks has bilateral lower extremity contractures??? That’s not why she’s even here. PT is working with her and she’s improving. She’s only here to finish her IV antibiotics for osteomyelitis in her sacral wound. All I know is she came from home and is wheelchair bound.\n\nHad her numerous times and this question never got asked in report before, and definitely never got such a strong reaction to telling next shift about her legs. I read the notes and pretty sure I never saw anything about it either. \nShe proceeds to complain during report that she has the “assignment from hell.” Not to mention I told her that this lady is literally the cutest and sweetest ever. She hardly calls and is completely cooperative. The easiest total on the floor probably. \n\nOK then Karen. Drag your ass on over to charge and tell them you would like the assignment changed please. Do not waste my time in report getting all worked up and asking every question under the sun if you’re just going to ask for a different assignment anyways. \n\nNext is the actual charge nurse who’s entire aura is just like negative all the time. She’s super smart and really good at being charge, but she’s one of those people who you can just feel her judgement all the time because to be fair, she probably just actually is smarter than most and gets tired of it. I’m literally giving her a sweet independent lady and still felt like she was just miserable and didn’t wanna be there though. Like that doesn’t make me feel good when my shift with this pt was so great??\n\nI’m so sick of negative people coming in and ruining my enthusiasm for this job with their bad fucking attitudes. It’s rare to have a good shift and sucks to have a shitty ending to it. I KNOW it’s stressful. It’s not my fault. Manage yourself and your own stress so you’re not ruining your coworkers day being passive aggressive. Thanks for listening. \nTl;dr I had a good shift and next shift ruined my mood by being passive and rude during report.",

    "text": "Threatened with “patient abandonment” Today I got my work schedule mixed up (they constantly switch our schedules without telling us) and showed up to the ED when I was not scheduled today. I looked at the assignment sheet and didn’t see my name so I asked charge “hey my name isn’t on here was I not on the daily sheet or something?” She abruptly replied “oh I probably didn’t see you on it but you can go work over in the back pod” me: ok can u just double check the schedule and let me know because I would prefer to go home if I wasn’t scheduled 😌 charge nurse: oh sweetie I mandated myself because we are short staffed so we need you. \nI go back and talk to the other nurses and help out with a couple ivs etc then go back to the charge nurse to see if she checked the schedule. She said “you aren’t scheduled for today”\nMe: ok so can I go home then since I’m not even scheduled to work (mind you I didn’t not even have patients at this time) \nHer: let me check *starts calling people*\n30 minutes later I get a call from an er supervisor who says “you can not leave but you may be able to leave in a few hours if staffing permits it”\nI talk about my situation with coworkers and they are telling me to just walk out and leave, call the house supervisor, etc. I am not a super confrontational person especially when I’m tired so I was like ehhhhhhh I guess I’ll just stay and put up with it. \nOne of the nurses who was working with me went up to charge about an hour later asking why they would not let me just leave. The charge nurse said “because that would be considered patient abandonment!” The nurse said…”she only has 2 patients that don’t even need anything, she can give me those patients so she can go home… and charge said “no”\n\nI left after 5 hours because they finally granted me permission to leave and they said “you will even get the extra incentive  bonus of $10 an hour even though technically you didn’t really qualify for it but I asked the manager to make an exception so you’re welcome” \n\nThinking to myself: Oh wowwww an extra $10 an hour for being treated like shit gee thanks \n😄",

A month ago, I had sudden, severe abdominal pain develop over the course of four hours from feeling fine to OMG-hospital-oh-please! Flank pain in the lower-right quadrant. As soon as appendicitis was confirmed, it was a nurse who started me on morphine so I could endure the hours of waiting for my surgery. My interaction with her was brief, but the pain relief was glorious and fast.\n\nI had a lot more interaction with the nurses and CNAs who oversaw my recovery, and from the newly-minted nurse to the most experienced carers, from the locals to the travel nurses, they were all great, and all clearly had my interests at heart. The nurse who I think was new to nursing skimped a bit on my pain meds during her night shift, and the more experienced nurse on the next shift helped me increase my dosage to achieve breakthrough from the pain, but I can't find fault anywhere. I think the new nurse was being conservative because of the dangers of opioids and the likelihood that such caution has been drilled into her recently in school, but she was very conscientious about getting me the next dose as soon as it was available to me. And the point is, I could see, hear and feel that both nurses cared about me and were exercising judgment in offering me the best care.\n\nCNAs must get tired of apologizing when they wake patients to take vitals, but the apology is an act of kindness every time. A kindness that I did, indeed, receive every time.\n\nTwo years ago, I had a kidney transplant, and there again, I had a mix of very experienced nurses to one who double and triple checked everything that he did, who I suspect was new. And all those CNAs and nurses were also kind, hard-working, and never signaled that they were rushed or harried even though they sometimes were. I had a poor psyche reaction to huge doses of prednisone that I was started on, and I dehisced and had to be re-sewn, so my recovery was extended. It was a nurse who noticed how much difficulty I has having swallowing my dozens of pills every day because of a gag reflex after anesthesia. It was that nurse who taught me to -- counterintuitively -- tuck my chin to swallow a pill. That great advice was something I just passed along to my elderly father after a choking incident gave him the same difficulty. The education offered by one nurse can multiply.\n\nThe hospital where I had my appendectomy included in my discharge documents a form for nominating someone for an award \"for extraordinary nurses.\" The problem with making such a nomination is that I'd have to single out one nurse when I think you're all extraordinary for choosing, and sticking with, a profession that is ten flavors of demanding.\n\nI think I managed to thank all of my carers and even the hospital admins I encountered. I know that some patients never thank anyone, feel entitled, think that their ignorance is superior to the knowledge of trained professionals. I thank you for putting up with them and doing your best for them even when they thoroughly deserve a lecture that begins, \"Look, asshole...\"\n\nThere's an archaeological dig that discovered the bones of an ancient hunter-gatherer who had suffered, and healed from, a broken leg. In any other species, such a severe break would be a death sentence. But other members of this persons group brought food, offered protection, and likely gestures of comfort until the break was healed. One of the earliest human practices is nursing.\n\nTo all the men and women in nursing and all the allied fields of medicine, you are all exemplars of what is best in humanity. I'm wishing you restorative rest (when you can get it) and strength.\n\nThank you.",

    "text": "Is it possible to come back from burnout? On Sunday's shift, it suddenly hit me that I didn't care any more. I was working half numb, half angry at random things, and I realised that spark that made me a nurse, that caring, kind, considerate person who went above and beyond, was vanished. \n\nI don't know what the tipping point was, but every time I close my eyes I'm hit with a reel of the past four months. The patients thrashing and tearing at their masks as they desat and die a slow, suffocating death by Covid. Knowing that one of our last surviving regulars is hanging by a thread in our ICU after being attacked by two men with hammers (our patient has zero legs, wheelchair bound, who the actual fuck does that to a person?). Watching my colleagues all fade and disappear, either off sick, or taking new jobs. The endless mortuary paperwork I filled in nearly every shift. The desperate feeling of abandonment when there was so little staff and managers simply stopped answering their phones to us. The jarring sound of the call buzzers over and over. The irritating rustle of the plastic aprons that are supposed to stop Covid from sticking to us. The curling up in my bed on days off, desperately trying to blank my mind as thoughts raced through my head. \n\nI always thought when I hit burnout it would be an Event. That there would be firey flames of disaster and drama, but it merely whispered in my head, and I knew what it meant, when it said \"Stop.\"\n\nI called my senior charge nurse today and told her how I was feeling and she told me she had already known. She has just come back from a years absence and the Zwirnor that she knew last year was not the one she had been working with the past three weeks. So I'm engaging with the hospital services and occupational health, I've been referred to psychological staff support services, I've contacted my own GP, my antidepressants have been upped, but I'm sitting here and I simply don't know how, or if indeed if it is possible, to get back the love of my job again. Nursing is in my very veins, but suddenly it's not there and I feel empty. I don't quite know how to express it. I almost feel like I've just noticed a limb is no longer there, there's confusion as to how I missed it happening, and grief at its passing, and fear that it'll never come back. \n\nHave any of you come back from this? How did you do it? Thankfully I've got some sick pay entitlement so I have a bit of time to figure it out, but if it's gone for good I need to work fast to figure out what I can possibly do to pay the bills. At this point I am open to everything*. I need to get myself back. \n\n\n\n\n\n*Except wheatgrass. That is my threshold. Shots of pureed wheatgrass is where I will call time.",

    "text": "Working with dead weight... what do you do? So I cannot express my gratitude and appreciation for PCA's who truly are with their weight in gold.  They have been my eyes and ears and support and I could not provide the care I do with out them.  I truly respect what they do and understand that they are underpaid and often under appreciated.  I am not talking about the rock stars but the slugs.  The ones who throw you dirty looks when you ask them to well... do their jobs.  You ask them to help pull up a patient knowing that you are risking your own back because of the half ass attempt they give pulling a patient.  You ask for assistance with an incontinent patient and they are barely present.  Somehow you are always at the party side and they just walk out of the room with the patient still needing help and ultimately you have to finish up.  So, you stop asking for help because you know it's not worth the attitude or potential injury.  These PCAs or nurses are always shopping online and are working practically every day overtime because hey why not when you get to sit at the desk all evening and night.  I just don't know what to do because I hear ohhh so and so is a good person...really?  a good person who lets her co workers sink? that's a good person?  You nay bring up your concern to your manager but somehow your concerns are not addressed but maybe  \"you should ask that person in a nicer way to help you and make sure you say Thank You\".  Maybe even your concerns are construed as somehow racial profiling or prejudice?   Not that the person is killing morale sitting in their ass being rewarded for laziness but you have an issue with their race which has no merit at all?  I am so fed up.  I work with some really good people but it's so hard to ignore the one or two who make my job a living hell especially when it is a PCA and they are the only one and they purposely avoid helping you because you expect them to do their job.  There's my rant.",

    "text": "Leaving the ICU Well I finally pulled the trigger! After doing both full time ICU and per diem ED all throughout the pandemic I finally made the decision to leave the ICU behind, at least for now. \n\n**As of today, for the first time in my nursing career, I am officially a full time ED RN** 😎\n\n*Will I miss having only two(ish) patients?*\n\nOf course. *Of course.* That’s like the main perk of the ICU lol.\n\n*Will I miss most of my patients being unconscious?*\n\nOh yes indeed, I will miss you most of all my little sleepyheads. 💛\n\n*Will I miss the challenge of managing a vent, CRRT, 8 different drips and god knows what else all at once, x2-3 patients?*\n\nYa know, I really will. There’s nothing like being able to really go super Type A and micromanage your patient to your heart’s content. Titrations on point, dressings clean and fresh, every single IV cap and label in place — gives me the warm fuzzies just thinking about it. \n\n*Will I miss constantly initiating super aggressive measures on patients with no hope of survival?*\n\nNope. Not in the least. But granny’s a full code and dignity in death never seems to be a priority for anyone. So yeah, let’s push some bicarb and start a third pressor on my cachetic, GCS 3, metastatic 98-year-old because why the hell not, maybe if we try hard enough we can yank her back from the banks of the River Styx and squeeze a few more days or even weeks out of this poor husk of a human being. \n\n*Will I miss being in the COVID ICU -*\n\nNo. \n\n*Not even a little bit?*\n\nHm let me see. The moment when you walk into your shift and first lay eyes on your patient, cyanotic and gasping, and know that shift is not going to end well. Admitting the same patient over and over again, like hitting your head against a brick wall *”young, no medical history, unvaccinated unvaccinated UNVACCINATED.”* Fielding calls literally all day long from every loved one, neighbor, and passing acquaintance the patient has, demanding updates and explanations. Explaining for the millionth time: no we’re not giving ivermectin *you fucking dolt* [emphasis mine], and no I would not care to hear at length about Dr. Joe Rogan’s miracle elixir or what the fuck ever. The screaming demands to speak to the doctor, to visit, to give the patient whatever screwy cure of the day is in vogue at the moment. The patients calling loved ones or hospital administrators or both from their rooms and reporting neglect because we’re not suiting up and going in the room every hour on the hour just to tidy up and shoot the shit. The iPad video calls where you can literally witness the exact moment when someone sees their hospitalized loved one for the first time and comes to the instant understanding that they’re never going to come home. The way a wife gently presses her hand against the glass door and cries, knowing her husband is going to die alone or with only strangers at his side …. \n\nYeah I’m good on the ICU for a while. I understand very well that the ED is a whole other bucket of crazy, and that some of these problems obviously transcend departments. \n\nBut I can’t do ICU any more, not right now. There are a lot of reasons that the ICU is a good match for me, but it comes with a very real emotional toll, no matter how good you think you are at clocking out and leaving it all on the dance floor. \n\nMaybe I’ll switch back in a few years when I’ve processed and dealt with all the things that I’ve seen in the past year and a half, but for now give me your drunks, give me your STEMIs, give me your stubbed toes. The ICU patients will still be there, but at least there’s a little levity mixed in here in the ED 🤷‍♀️",

    "text": "I am not doing well and am not sure what to do So, I developed PTSD from watching all my very close patients die last year.  Now anytime we have covid in the building I start getting flashbacks. I actually had a break down and did pull my hair out in frustration. \n\nI left my educator job and am back on the floor the idea was less stress or more manageable stress. \n\nI was tired of never knowing when I was going home, tired of always being asked to stay over, tired of the never ending meetings. So changing positions seemed like a great idea, right? \n\nHahahahahaha\n\nI'm often working as sup and passing meds, sometimes I have two wings. I'm angry and crying all the time. It's difficult for me to change jobs- as you can't qualify for FMLA if you haven't been there for at least a year and I need to get spinal injections plus my brother probably has cancer. Since he can no longer walk or work due to this pain his doctor ignored for over a year and now has fused lymph nodes... He's probably going to die because he's going to lose his insurance. \n\nI can't ever get a sleep schedule or pattern because I'm constantly asked to switch a shift or pick up. \n\nThe few times I do get to be just sup? I'm mostly fine. \n\nBut I'm not well and literally everyone knows it. I feel like I'm tip toeing around half the time. \n\nMy DON told me to snap out of it when I was in hysterics so that was fun. Then when I muttered, \"snap out if it-why didn't I think about that?\" She yelled at me for getting \"smart\" with her. Like, I'm not being smart. I was in hysterics and hyperventilating for fucks sake. She's scared to leave me alone in the building. Which you should be for fucks sake I've been telling you that being in this building makes me want to die what about this is ambiguous?!\n\nAnd I've got CNAs telling people that I was rolling around on the floor pulling my hair out (I have laid on the floor in people's offices with my knees bent when I was having very bad back pain as it was one of the few things that helped, I have never rolled on the ground). \n\nI don't even get to sleep properly since I'm constantly being bugged to come in and work. \n\nI'm seeing a therapist, I'm seeing psych, I've had my meds increased (and was withdrawaling off effexor during all this which just added to the mix). \n\nI don't know what else to do. I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with my job. Being constantly bugged to work reminds me of when my abusive ex would harass me for sex- so double PTSD issues yay! \n\nI've tried telling people. I've tried talking with HR and even my CEO. \n\nI feel like the only way anyone is going to listen if they find me hanging in closet, but I'm not going to do that to my coworkers, please no one think I'm going to hurt myself-that actually takes energy. I'm crying as I'm writing all this down because I need to get it out. \n\nI've been crying in front of my patients. I don't like that. I'm getting snippy to everyone. \n\nWhat's sad is I feel like the only time I'm actually heard or listened to is when I'm yelling and/or refusing to clock in. Which I have done lately because we were supposed to get several readmits with me on the cart. It was changed to just one and an admit but it's all too much. How do you expect people to do this? How long before people start to die from errors because we're distracted? \n\nThat being said the CNA who's been telling everyone she's seen me rolling on the floor pulling my hair out is working in the morning when I leave and she and I are going to have a little chat. In public. Because I don't trust her. I'm struggling- I don't need her starting shit on top of it. I guess my very real issues are just so fucking funny to them. Yeah this talk did not go well. She essentially told me that I was getting what was coming to me, so that was really cool. Just the icing on the shit sandwich. \n\nAnyway. I just don't know where to go from here. I feel like I'm in a fucking pit and can't escape. I did have a former coworker offer me a RNAC job but I have never done that before and am worried about it I need time off. \n\nI will take any advice. Thank you\n\nEdit: sooooooo someone told me CEO and now I have next week off. To see if that'll help. Idk. Guess we'll see.",

    "text": "I took the opportunity to raise concerns about staffing levels with a higher up (on my day off) So our one higher up who used to be a nurse comes in for semi-regular \"drop in\" sessions to discuss any concerns we have. For months myself and others have been complaining about how our staffing levels (4 people in the afternoon with 1 x 1:1 eyesight incorporated into this number for a 16 bed male acute mental health ward) I identified it as a main reason for me going off with stress, and I knew if I didn't take the opportunity to talk about this I would be annoyed at myself.\n\nThe director listened to my concerns, and actually appeared to take them on board. He agreed that from my lived experience of the ward, and the others in the session backing me up, that there needed to be a discussion with the ward managers about the fact that they are allowed to go over budget as long as they can justify it, and the reasons given in the discussion with myself and the others in the room were cause for concern. Myself and a HCA expressed that there were lots of times we felt scared or vulnerable (the HCA has been in the trust for like 30 years, he knows his shit)\n\nI did repeatedly express that my own manager is really supportive of the ward, me personally and that our team is excellent, with a great mix of skills. In fact my manager had the ward operating on a higher number of staff before she felt increasing pressure to reduce costs. One of my concerns is that we weren't utilising the teams potential as more specialist/auxillary team members were called in to do nursing team work which was also considered.\n\nOverall it was actually a really positive experience and I'm glad I did it, although my avoidant PD traits and anxiety were pretty high leading up to it (pulse went from 58 to 134 lol). He stated that our new COO has already asked for an emergency meeting about staffing levels for inpatient ward, and asked for my consent to use my experience (anonymously) as an example of the atmosphere on acute wards. Soz if anyone has a director/higher up that at least tries to appear to care, I would recommend getting a few people together to discuss concerns.",

    "text": "Does anyone not feel a part of the Healthcare team as a nurse? Hey guys I’ve been a nurse now for about four years and been in the ICU for over two years. My unit is a mixed unit with surgical and cardiac cases. I’m going back to CRNA school soon and honestly I’m counting down the days. I haven’t once felt like I was respected as a nurse in my job. Where I made a good catch or quickly noticed a change in my patient I was either ignored or belittled. It feels as if because I have a RN attached to me name it means I’m not qualified to say anything at all. One day I had a patient who was vented on drips not drain anything from their nephrostomy tube and I quickly said there’s a chance the tube might have been displaced because it was draining a lot beforehand. I quickly got dismissed by the PAs and Residents until 4pm when they realized there was no output the whole shift and ordered a CT scan which actually showed I was correct. In rounds I feel like a total joke where my only contribution to rounds is if either the patient had a bowel movement or not and everybody asks from the attending, to the PA/Residents and pharmacist. Management sees us a replaceable and doesn’t mind saying it even thought we have lately been short staffed and been doubling CRRT and ECMO, with occasional triples of other assignments. I sound like a burnt out nurse and honestly I am but I have also just been working in some bad situations. Even when I started working on the floor it was not a good time and that’s a story by itself.

I'm currently contracted with a large pharmacy chain to vaccinate staff and residents of long term care clinics. We travel to many small clinics around the city administering the Pfizer vaccine. Originally I was trained that reconstituted partially used vials are good for up to 6 hours if kept in our travel cooler, so we would mark the remaining doses, and use them at the next clinic. However about a week ago I was told by the manager of our districts project that we are no longer allowed to do this, and that this change was coming from Pfizer, not our company. Later I was told by another employee that there's no way this policy was coming from Pfizer and that it was coming from our company. I cannot find any information online regarding this change in reconstituted vaccine storage. The CDC's website currently states: \"Keep mixed vaccine between 2⁰C and 25⁰C (36⁰F and 77⁰F) and administer within 6 hours. Discard any unused vaccine after 6 hours. Do not return to freezer storage.\" \n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/index.html\n\nI am now being told that a vial that has been reconstituted is supposedly only good for only 1 hour, and cannot be used at the next clinic, even if less than an hours time has passed.\n\nThere are 6 doses to a vial, and often times we visit clinics with a number of people that is not a multiple of 6, leaving up to 5 doses of reconstituted vaccine leftover in a vial. Yesterday the small team I was on traveled to multiple clinics, administered about 75 vaccines, and were forced to waste 15 doses. Some days it's more. This is just on one team of many working all over the country for this large pharmacy chain.

So why can't you?**\n\nIt's because we have been lied to and propagandized our whole lives that Capitalism is not only good, but its the only \"sane\" economic system.\n\n**Do you feel comfortable?**\n\n**Has work made you comfortable?**\n\n**How long do you need to work to reach comfort?**\n\nThe ruling class desires you to give up everything except work. \n\nMaybe its time we stopped trying to solve our problems individually attempting the same solution and instead united in solidarity and just stopped.\n\nAlso, I might be wrong but I'm of the opinion that bullies throw tantrums and attack others to force those people to do what they want.\n\n**So what should you do now?

    "text": "I’m Not Fit to Be a Teacher (Or, It's OK to Be Imperfect) A couple years back, I was sitting in my classroom after a challenging day, feeling like an abysmal failure, wondering if I should even bother coming in tomorrow. \n\nI worked with a lot of challenging students that particular year. Kids with troubled home lives, substance abuse issues, and behavioral problems. Because of all their other needs, English wasn’t the highest priority on any given school day. \n\nWe were a couple quarters into the school year and nothing had really gone how I wanted. I didn’t feel like I was getting anywhere. Sure, I had made some great connections with kids, but my efficacy as a teacher—measured in growth in my students’ skills—was seemingly nonexistent. \n\nI felt exhausted and stuck.\n\nI reached a particularly low spot one morning when I was informed a student of mine was to be arrested for violating his probation. Watching through a gap in the door as he was frisked, handcuffed, and escorted away to the awaiting police cruiser, knowing I’d likely never see him back in the classroom again, hurt in a way I can’t really describe. My heart ached and my mind raced trying to think of where I could’ve helped him. \n\nWhen I got home that day and the sadness of it all had firmly enshrouded me, I asked my wife, “When do I know if it’s too much? That I can’t do it?”\n\nHer reply was something along the lines of: *Just keep moving forward*. \n\nThis is the part where I’m supposed to tell you how I buckled down, put in the extra work, and *moved forward*. \n\nExcept, I didn’t. \n\nI just continued sinking—until I fell into a depression so deep it had me convinced the best thing for my students, my family, and everyone I knew would be killing myself. It told me I was so bad at my job that the whole school, my students especially, were worse for me being there. I had failed that aforementioned student and I would fail the rest. \n\nThat last quarter was brutal. Even getting out of bed took nearly all I had to give. I felt so bitter and hateful and ugly, standing up in front of my students was excruciating.\n\nI wanted to die. \n\nI talked a bit to my colleagues about my struggles, afraid to reveal too much. I tried journaling and writing to see if it would help. I drafted an article called “My Teacher Mask” but immediately shelved it out of shame. \n\nI’ve spent my entire working life terrified people will find out I live with bipolar disorder and anxiety. Because I don’t want them to treat me differently. I don’t want them to make assumptions. I don’t want them to distrust me or be afraid of me. I don’t want them to think less of me—that I’m weak or incapable or unworthy. \n\nBecause teachers are held to expectations that aren’t always sensitive to the fact they’re human. The news is riddled with teachers fired for social media faux pas, and communities often seem more willing to crucify a teacher than stand behind and support them. I see these seemingly benign missteps destroy some teachers’ careers and I recoil.\n\nI look at myself with all my flaws and shortcomings, it’s nearly impossible to imagine myself being capable of doing anything useful—whether it’s educating children or creating something of value. My mind, when it starts to slip into that depressive way of thinking, will render me incapable of seeing myself as anything other than hideous, useless, and stupid. My lectures turn to ash in my mouth because I feel like an imposter, a liar. \n\nI thought after the school year ended, my dark thoughts and depression would recede. And for quite a while, they did. I moved forward. I got on a new treatment plan. I got a job in a vastly different district full of very different students and, for a while, felt pretty good. \n\nThen, as we got to the middle of the school year, I completely fell apart. I ended up in one of the worst depressions of my life and almost died. \n\nThis led to me seeing the pattern of all my school years, the fluctuations and nosedives, the sudden elaborate lessons and crushing defeatedness. \n\nLooking back on my brief teaching career, I realize I spent far too much time and effort trying to live as though my mental illness didn’t exist—that I didn’t have to plan and adjust my job performance to find a realistic, healthy balance that accommodated the inevitable highs and lows. \n\nI tried to function not as I was, but how I imagined I ought to be. In my mind, at that time, teachers weren’t allowed to have flaws, to be human, and focus on anything but their students and their classroom. \n\nI suppose if that’s the case, then I’m not fit to be a teacher. And I’m okay with that. I’ll never be perfect. My flaws and limitations are part of me, and they’ve gifted me a deeply empathetic way of seeing the world and my fellow humans. And even if I don’t make for a successful teacher, I can still use my gifts—whatever those might be—for other positive things. \n\nI’ll admit there are times my mind can be a terrible place to be. But it can also be beautiful, wonderful, strange, exciting, and even fun. Just not any of those things for a consistent amount of time. \n\n**Here’s where I try to be helpful with what I learned:** \n\nThe first—and probably most important—thing you can do to start moving forward is to exercise *self-compassion*. I know, it might sound silly, but being forgiving and kind to yourself is the best way to prepare yourself for the challenging, important work to come. \n\nI’m sort of naturally brutal to myself, and when I make mistakes, I’m totally ready to beat the hell out of myself for it. Something that stuck with me from Joy Johnson’s workbook was when she asked something along the lines of: *Does it help?* And truly, beating yourself up and berating yourself is only going to impede your efforts to grow. You have to stop, take a breath, and treat yourself kindly. Then you can move on to planning and self-work. \n\nAnd as a little aside, when I was feeling particularly down about my performance or ability, I would remind myself of this little logical mantra: \n\n**Humans are imperfect**—and that’s okay.\n\n**Teachers are humans...**\n\nAnd **therefore, teachers are imperfect**—and that’s okay.\n\nI’ll sometimes replace **teachers** with **parents** if I’m having a rough one with my own kids. \n\nBeyond that, I followed these steps: \n\n1. **Get help, build a treatment plan.** If you’re in crisis, go to the Emergency Room and ask for help. Otherwise, visit a doctor or mental health professional and start building a course of treatment. I can’t describe to you how radically my life changed after I started taking medication, going to counseling, and managing my mental health like I would any other ailment. \n2. **Establish and nurture your system(s) of support.** Who do you turn to when you’re low or struggling? Take note of these people or establishments, and nurture them whenever you’re able. That means being there for that friend who’s there for you, or finding ways to show them how meaningful their presence in your life is. \n3. **Prioritize mental & physical wellness.** Meditate. Feed your brain good books. See a counselor or therapist. Get to the gym or yoga studio. Don’t eat so much junk food or drink too much. A lot of these things require planning and setting boundaries (such as, I’ll only have a couple drinks, and only on Saturday; or, we only eat out on Fridays, that’s pizza day). Make sure you’re getting plenty of sleep. Take care of your *self* as best as you can, because it’s the only one you get. \n\nRegardless of your job and whether or not you fit the role, you have to make room to bring your *self* to work. That means all your quirks and foibles, all your curses and gifts. If you spend too much time trying to stuff yourself into a preconceived box, it can make you miserable. \n\nAnd that’s not okay.",

    "text": "Tennessee educators oppose attacks on teachers’ free speech rights [Statement of the Tennessee Educators Rank-and-File Safety Committee](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/07/20/tenn-j20.html) regarding the recent passage of a bill that bans the discussion of anything that “promot\\[es\\] division between, or resentment of, a race, sex, religion, creed, nonviolent political affiliation, social class, or class of people.” Essentially a ban on critical race theory, discussion of social class, or any other perspective on history that runs counter to the state government's desired world view. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Tennessee Educators Rank-and-File Safety Committee opposes the legislation (HB 0580/SB 0623) passed by Tennessee’s right-wing legislature aimed at intimidating teachers and attacking their free speech and academic freedom.\n\nThis legislation includes a prohibition against instruction that “promot\\[es\\] division between, or resentment of, a race, sex, religion, creed, nonviolent political affiliation, social class, or class of people.”\n\nLater, the bill nonsensically qualifies this prohibition with the claim that “this section does not prohibit” schools or instructors from making use of textbooks or instructional materials that discuss “the history of an ethnic group” or include “the impartial discussion of controversial aspects of history” or “the impartial instruction on the historical oppression of a particular group of people based on race, ethnicity, class, nationality, religion, or geographic region.”\n\nThis distinction between the “promotion” of divisions and the “impartial discussion” of them seems to be intentionally vague. We cannot escape the conclusion that the legislators hope to intimidate teachers into avoiding controversial topics to avoid getting into trouble.\n\nA [series of similar laws](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/06/22/crit-j22.html) has been passed throughout the country in states with Republican-dominated legislatures. As awful as they are, these laws are only the opening shot in a broader campaign to undermine any kind of socially critical instruction in schools. Two laws recently [passed in Florida](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/06/26/flor-j26.html) go even further than the legislation in Tennessee and serve as a warning to educators everywhere.\n\nThe Florida laws restructure civics education in high schools and require that students pass a civic literacy assessment either in high school or in college in order to prove their grasp of the supposed evils of communism as compared with the supposedly more democratic US political system. The legislation requires public universities to survey faculty and students on their political beliefs and face a possible loss of funding if not enough students and faculty profess their allegiance to a right-wing perspective. Nothing in the legislation guarantees the anonymity of the responses, which brings into question what will be done to those individuals who answer in a way that displeases the state’s right-wing legislature.\n\nFrom the anticommunist McCarthyite witch-hunts in the United States to the purging of Jewish and left-wing academics from German universities by the Nazi party, the practice of drawing up lists of dissidents has a dark history.\n\nThe Tennessee Educators Rank-and-File Safety Committee condemns this legislation and stands with Florida primary and secondary school and university teachers and students in opposing these laws.\n\nAlready, the Tennessee legislation has been used to target an individual teacher. Matthew Hawn, a tenured high school social studies teacher in Sullivan County, Tennessee, came under attack the day after the state legislature passed HB 0580/SB 0623 into law. Hawn assigned his class to read an essay titled, “The First White President,” by Ta-Nehisi Coates, that was published in the *Atlantic*. For this he was censured by the school board and suspended without pay pending possible termination.\n\nOur committee has fundamental disagreements with the theoretical foundations and historical claims expressed by Hawn himself and outlined in this essay. This outlook is inspired by the concepts of critical race theory, which posits the existence of irreconcilable racial divisions in our society, above all in the working class. Nevertheless, we oppose all efforts to censor Hawn and other teachers who have views similar to his. The open discussion of a variety of points of view is of the utmost importance to the education of young people in our society.\n\nSocial class is the fundamental division in our society, not “race, sex, religion, or creed.” Class divisions and the resentments they produce are real, not the mere inventions of teachers. Moreover, the current fascistic and anti-socialist attacks on teachers are taking place in the context of a dramatic intensification of real class divisions.\n\nNowhere are divisions of class more apparent than in the response of the political representatives of the ruling class to the emerging coronavirus variants, which threaten to reverse even the meager progress accomplished by the partial vaccination of the US and world population. The emergence of these variants is the direct result of the politicians’ criminally irresponsible policies of herding workers back into unsafe working conditions and teachers and students back into unsafe schools. Meanwhile, the wealthy continue to have access to safe working environments and the best care the medical profession has to offer.\n\nIgnoring the urgent warnings of the World Health Organization and epidemiologists around the world, the Biden administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reversed masking recommendations, continuing in all fundamental respects the very same policies pursued by the Trump administration. This has provided fertile ground for the virus to evolve, further threatening the lives of workers and their children.\n\nThe Delta variant now presents a triple threat in the schools. Under conditions where children under 12 years old, roughly half the school-aged population, are not yet eligible for vaccination, and most children 12 years old or older remain unvaccinated, the withdrawal of mask recommendations will fuel the spread of the disease, promoting the evolution of new and even more dangerous variants, and killing or permanently disabling an untold number of children, teachers, their family members and the broader population.\n\nNational divisions in vaccine production and distribution, which have created a situation where most of the world’s poorer countries have little or no access to any COVID-19 vaccine, are further fueling these same processes.\n\nIf human life rather than private profit were the priority, the pandemic could be brought under control within months. However, the capitalist classes in nearly every country have not taken the necessary measures to end the pandemic because doing so would run counter to their profit interests.\n\nThe wealth divide in American society continues to grow, intensifying the class struggle on a global scale. Aided and abetted by the corrupt, corporatist trade unions and their pseudo-left acolytes, the American capitalists are pursuing record profits at the expense of human lives. Worldwide, billionaires’ wealth surged 60 percent during the first year of the pandemic alone.\n\nAgain, teachers have not *created* these class divisions and antagonisms. The capitalist class itself is working with ruthless abandon to deepen the existing divisions in our society, which is the real cause of deepening resentments. How could we *not* resent the fact that the capitalist class is threatening the lives of working people and our children simply in order to enrich itself?\n\nThe capitalists are well aware that they cannot get away with their homicidal behavior indefinitely without producing a massive social explosion the likes of which the world has never seen. Under conditions in which the class struggle increasingly threatens to break out of the stranglehold of the corporatist trade unions, which for decades have functioned as little more than an auxiliary police force for workplace management, the capitalist class, above all its more fascistic elements, are concerned about the role that public education institutions could come to play in the discussion and dissemination of ideas critical of the capitalist system itself.\n\nSo, we understand *why* the Tennessee legislature is attacking our free speech and trying to intimidate us into silence. However, understanding and justification are not the same thing. HB 0580/SB 0623 is unjustifiable and unconstitutional. Teachers have the first amendment right to discuss and oppose the acts of class warfare of the capitalist class, including in the classroom.\n\nWe demand the immediate repeal of HB 0580/SB 0623, the immediate reinstatement with back pay of Michael Hawn, and an end to all further efforts to victimize individual teachers or their schools for the content of their instruction.",

    "text": "\"I've only felt like this two other times in my life...\" TLDR: I've broken down every day this week. I've realized that teaching makes me feel like I'm a abusive situation again and I will be leaving at the soonest possible moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExtreme vent. Apologies for the length and possible errors, I haven't been sleeping well because of anxiety.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis week was one of the worst weeks of my life. I had a panic attack every single weekday. Monday, I got home and collapsed on the floor crying. Tuesday was the worst where I was stuck in the staff bathroom for hours because I couldn't stop panicking. I think I cried so much that I still feel dehydrated from that one. Wednesday was as I walking up the stairs to my classroom in the morning and again when I got home after active shooter training. Thursday was on the day off when I got an email about one of my students getting Covid. Friday was when my admin asked me about what's going on. Saturday wasn't a panic attack but so much exhaustion and depression that I literally couldn't get out of bed. Sunday was when I got another email about a student getting Covid AND just now thinking about school tomorrow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThankfully my admin and colleagues are actual angels and continually come to my rescue. They're all so supportive and willing to help me with basically anything. Now I'll have extra support occasionally  in the classroom to help with student behavior and to help with struggling students. I am in such a supportive environment, friends with all my coworkers, and am just so thankful for all of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that just makes me feel worse for leaving.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went into teaching to teach. Last year, I just got to teach. It was WONDERFUL. I still built awesome relationships with students and coworkers, but I could focus on teaching content. I got to teach science (my content area) instead of math, like I do now. I didn't have to manage student behavior, which is abysmal this year. I wasn't openly mocked for asking students to sit down. I didn't have to keep track of who was in the bathroom at all times. I didn't have to keep my ears open for shooter threats or practice drills that could mean life or death for me and my students. I didn't have to lesson plan into the night. I didn't have to go to mass. People told Covid seriously. I wasn't very stressed, didn't work overtime, and loved my job so much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not religious and I work at a catholic school. It makes me wildly uncomfortable. I participate in what I'm required to, but it's not my thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work with \\~200 students, or the entire middle school body. I know middle schoolers are hard to work with, but they're SO DIFFERENT from last year. We were constantly switching between hybrid and fully virtual, but the kids were happy to be getting an education. Now they hate being in school. They bully each other and they bully me. They think it's totally fine to not do their homework. They say they don't want to do the work, or don't understand it, or that I'm a bad teacher, then do perfect on their assessments. It feels like I'm being gaslit by 3 of my classes. They think it's funny to make classmates angry and that it's okay to interrupt lessons. I was told by my coworkers that students usually figure things out within 2 weeks and calm down. It's been 4 months at this point and they are still as bad as they were in the beginning. Even the veteran teachers say this is the worst year they've had student behavior-wise. Luckily we haven't had a fight, but I've had a 6th grader already threaten a student twice with violent remarks and lots of thefts. That's just the students. (I love my kids, but man, they gotta chill.) A coworkers said: \"you'll have war stories from at least one class every year.\" I don't want war stories!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe parents are a mixed bag as well. Some parents are lovely and supportive. Some are entitled and ask for so much. They get angry that their kid didn't study, so I guess that means it's my fault. They get angry that their kid got punished for bad behavior, so I guess that's my fault. They think they can manipulate me because I'm not a veteran and don't have my own classroom. I understand that most parents care deeply about their kids and want the best education possible for them, but maybe don't email them \"you're a bad teacher and my student and I hate you.\" (My wonderful admin reassured that I am, in fact, not a bad teacher. That email still hurt a lot though).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI teach 6 different classes. None of them are the same. No same levels of math or science. So I have to plan out 6 different classes. The curriculum is basically non-existent and I'm building a lot of it from scratch with some help from teachers who teach one of the same classes. I use my prep times to grade, but it's never enough time to plan. I take grades maybe once or twice a week, so I don't do a lot of grading. Preps are also used to communicate with parents, meet with colleagues/admin, cover classes, or recess duty for younger grades. I refuse to bring work home, but I end up having to lesson plan at home because it's just SO MUCH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Covid pandemic on top of it all is just awful. When Covid was taken more seriously and we were in and out of hybrid, I felt more safe than I do now. We didn't allow group projects, kept everyone 6 feet apart, students stayed in one class, etc. Now that's all gone. I've had multiple students out for Covid or quarantine already this year, and our cases just keep going up. I have to email students and parents with homework, then when they return they're behind! We have masks, but now the distance is 3 feet and kids don't listen so they all bunch up. I have to remind multiple kids per class to cover their noses. It's awful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen there's all the work. SO MUCH WORK. Not only professional work, like lesson planning and grading, but emotional work! I've got to know the problems of every student and keep track of every accommodation. I have to be able to discern the signs of anxiety, depression, panic attacks, etc. I have to keep a happy mask on all day and can't have a bad day. I've lost my temper twice this year and yelled. I don't yell. Ever. I come home every single day drained. I feel like I've lost my identity— I don't have the energy to play video games, read books, or cook anymore. I barely have the energy to date my SO, who I love so much, so this is also affecting my relationship. I want to be my happy, excited self again, but I just can't and haven't been that way since September. Teaching brought me so much joy last year, and now the tiny victories are shadowed by the massive shitstorm that's raining on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI haven't had a panic attack since high school (6 years ago). I haven't had depressive episodes or autoimmune flare-ups since I was in an unhealthy relationship (2 years ago). I can't even workout anymore because of the flare-ups. Anxiety and depression are RARE outside of those two instances. My mental and physical health are declining at a rapid pace. As I was breaking down to my admin, words came out of my mouth that provided the clarity I needed: \"I've only felt like this two other times in my life— when I lived in an abusive household and when I was in a bad relationship. The first time I felt truly happy in the past two months was during Thanksgiving Break.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy school is amazing in so many ways, and I still have such a strong love for teaching. But I can't sacrifice my health for the kids. I gotta be selfish for once in my life. I've applied to some jobs at the nearby university yesterday and will be putting in my resignation the second I get an offer for a new job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope you're doing well <3",

    "text": "PLS HELP RESTORE MY FAITH IN HUMANITY I just finished my first year as a bilingual Kindergarten teacher. I know what you're thinking... \"you signed up for hell when you chose Kindergarten\" but those sweet little psychos and their families are the only thing that kept me going this year.  \n\nThere are a lot of people involved in this so here is a key for who they are. \n\nU = other bilingual teacher \n\nP = director of human resources\n\nA = executive director of human resources\n\nG = superintendent\n\nK = principal\n\nB = vice principal \n\nJ = ESL specialist\n\nHere we go...\n\nAugust 2020 I thought I had found my dream job. I had moved back to my hometown where my parents have taught for as long as I could attend school. It was my dad's dream to one day get ready with his wife and daughter in the morning to all go to school to teach. So when he heard I got a job in the same district they teach in, he literally got tears in his eyes. (He was a computer teacher...so, he doesn't cry much. Lol) I had been collecting bilingual books since college and I wanted to teach at a Title I school where I could help where the most help was needed. So.... literally my dream job. \n\nSkip to October 2020, the kids have now been in school about a month. I was loving it..masks, desk shields, and all. October 14th was one of my students' birthdays; one day before mine. We celebrated and I had let the birthday boy pass out his cupcakes WITHOUT A MASK UGHHH. (Later, they asked people in charge of COVID stuff if my class had to quarantine and they said no bc it wasn't long enough of an interaction) Anyways... It's October 15th, 6:00am and I get an email from birthday boy's mom that he has COVID. rip. I come rushing into school asking what I'm supposed to do, contact tracing, etc. The nurse asks if we followed protocols & I responded yes except for the cupcake incident. But I told her to check with U , the other bilingual teacher, because she posted a video of the kid with two other kids sitting together without a mask on Seesaw. (We switched classes and taught each other's classes daily)  I go tell U to expect the nurse because my student has COVID and she freaks out bc she never has her mask on either. \n\nThen, I get called to a meeting with the nurse, U, and K (the principal). K tells us that two of my students will have to quarantine because U could not confirm that she asked the students to put the masks on within 15 minutes. We're sent back to class and I get an email about another meeting with K and U during my planning time. I go and K lets me know that U has concerns. Apparently, U has been feeling for a while that our students' parents are comparing us and that I am purposely trying to make her look bad. I tell her that I was just trying to give the kids as much resources as possible and didn't mean to make her look bad. She loses her shit and yells that she can't trust me and that I just want to be better than everyone. K tries to calm her down and then it's time to go pick up the kids from specials. I finish my day feeling really freaking confused and get an email about AN AFTERSCHOOL MEETING. I sit throught another meeting where U compares me to a 17 yo highschool girl (I am 22 and she was in her 50s). I am not exaggerating when I tell you that this woman stalked my SEESAW ACCOUNT to see if anyone had their masks off and was ready to show a file-folder portfolio of it and then proceeded to SCREAM that I'M a traitor. I couldn't get a word in because K proceeded to YELL AT HER to be quiet and stop talking ...no college program or professional development could have prepared me for what was happening before my eyes. Then, the lord answered my prayers and K told me that I could go so that her and U could have a private conversation. \n\nEventually, K tells me to try to be considerate about how my relationship with parents could be hurting U. Despite my own morals, I stop sending as much resources out. Meanwhile U has been at work on the other 4 Kindergarten teachers on the team. She tells them how I'm a traitor and that I think I'm better than all of them. I try to still interact with them but they start leaving me out of things and eventually have their own group chat without me. \n\nA few weeks later, I share with a colleague that I have known since I was 5 that I feel like I'm being bullied. That colleague shares it with K, the principal. The kindergarten team has to have a meeting with K because two other teachers were verbally fighting in the hallway. But, they had already beefed it out so the attention turns to me. Except I had NO IDEA we were about to talk about why I felt bullied. This was basically an opportunity for the other teachers to openly shit on me for having a \"communication problem with my teammate\" and for not \"socializing enough\". \n\nAt this point, my anxiety (which is usually controlled by medication) was off the rail and I felt completely alone. I went to see my doctor and she upped my dose and gave me additional meds which gave me KILLER side effects. I had to absent a few days. Because of the shortage of substitutes, the teachers had to split my kids up and this gave them more reason to hate me. FML. I come back and K has a meeting with me to tell me my team was upset with me because of my absences. I explained that I was having major side effects from the meds and I told her why I was anxious lately. She said she would push my eval date to later because she wasn't sure if I would be ready.  A week or so later I get a \"coin of excellence\" from  superintendent G because my students' parents are writing him emails about how happy they are. Soon enough, K calls me into her office and tells me she doesn't think she will consider me for rehire. I tell her that I would love to work on whatever it is she wants but I need specific examples of what she wants me to do. THESE WORDS WOULD COME BACK AND BITE ME IN THE ASS.  \n\nIt's now the day of the holiday party (right before our Thanksgiving/Christmas break). Our class is supposed to watch the Polar Express and I've created the cutest lesson to go with it where the kids create a book of tickets with a kind word for each of their classmates. One of the other teachers got sick and left so I had 5 of her kids come into my classroom that had no more chairs left. I get them settled and the kids continue working on the activity and watching the movie.  Then K and B (vice principal) come busting in. K tells me that B will watch my class and that I'm going to follow her. K tells me to take a look at my class and then she walks me outside of the room. She then proceeds to walk me to the other monolingual kindergarten teachers rooms and audibly says, \"THAT'S what I want you to do. That's what I want your class to look like\". The teacher was sitting at her desk on her laptop, the kids were all silent in their desks and watching the movie. She took my to the other classroom where it looked the exact same.. teacher at desk, silence, kids in chairs watching the movie. I tried to explain to her that I created an activity to go along with the movie but she told me to stop either the activity or movie immediately. We go back into my classroom where my students are literally rolling around the floor even though the vice principal was supposed to be \"watching them\". I get them to settle down and turn off the movie. K walks me around the room and points out everything that's wrong. Literally the definition of a Party Pooper. \n\nI've had enough at this point so I go to HR. My mom knew P (the director of HR) and assured me she would help. She was wrong. P listened and told me to sit down and have a talk with K after we return from the break. She also said she'd get me some district support since it sounded like I didnr have support at school. \n\nAfter break (January 2021) we have professional development before the kids come back. Things seemed fine with K and I was worried of stirring things up further. Things were NOT fine with K. She told me that J would now be in my class daily for about an hour to help me out. I thought this was for support until J ends up trying to boss me around and telling me that I'm not doing my job. That day I tell her to get out of my classroom because she is being a huge distraction to my students. If things aren't bad enough... I start getting a terrible cough. Eventually I have to leave early on a Friday because I feel really sick and completely lost my voice. Over the weekend, I have to go to urgent care and get a COVID test. The test comes out negative but the doctor is convinced it's a false negative...so, they write me a note and tell me I need to quarantine. I tell K, my team, and HR. HR then responds and tells me that my note doesn't qualify and that I will be docked after my remaining absences are used. I tell them that, in that case, I will be returning Monday. They then state that they will not allow me to return until I feel better... But, I will still be docked. That sounded like a bunch of balogna so I contacted my teacher union and she managed to get them to agree that if I can get a \"clearer note\" that I will get paid COVID leave. Please keep in mind that I'm dying of a fever and fighting off possible COVID. I call the urgent care enough to get them to pity me and they write \"due to covid symtoms\" on my note. Suddenly, those 4 magical words made my note \"qualify\". They give me the paid leave and I have about a weekend to recover until I have to go back. \n\nI get back to my classroom and someone has taken down all my students work in the hallway.     It's my first day back and K comes back \"for an observation\" and tells me how \"out of control\" my kids were while I've been gone. She tells me she'll need to meet for conference. During my conference time, she tells me how out of control my students have been while I've been gone. (Which hadn't been the case as evident by all the days that I had been texting with the substitutes) She then hits me with the, \"do you even want to teach kindergarten? Do you even want to be a teacher?\". I say, \"yes...I love teaching\". She responds, \"then you need to get better at it. It's not working out for you.\" She doesn't get enough time to shit on me because my students end up banging at my door because I was late to pick them up from specials. So, she tells me I need to meet after school. She tells me more BS and how she's not the only person that thinks I'm a terrible teacher. She says that my colleagues can never teach anything because of me, etc. \n\nI email superintendent G as soon as I leave the meeting and tell him to call me. He calls me that evening and I tell him everything. I'll give him props... He really had me thinking that he was going to \"fix\" this. He says that he wants me to continue in this district and that he would get A (executive director of HR) to give me a call and help me out. I tried to tell him that A was already biased because she was pissed about the COVID teacher union incident but he said it was fine. It was not fine. \n\nA ends up calling me eventually and tells me that she is going to tell me the exact same thing that P told me in November... To just sit down and talk to K about my feelings. I tell her I've tried but K is always aggressive and so she tells me to just try again. I email K at ungodly hours (because I'm not sleeping anyway) and tell her in the most professional way to please leave me alone so I have time to practice what she wants from me. So, she says that it's fine but proceeds to send in J to spy on me. \n\nI'm not taking that for an answer so I email superintendent G and tell him that I appreciate him sending me to A but K is now, by definition, harrasing me. He tells me to keep working with HR on the matter... But, he gets nervous so tells A to send me a discrimination and harrasment form so it can be investigation. Despite me telling him I'm uncomfortable with A doing the investigation, she is in charge of it anyway. \n\nIt is now mid February and have lost 20 pounds  (making me underweight), I have developed insomnia and the anxiety has turned into depression. Everytime the door to my classroom opens or I hear a knock, my heart races and I cry on the way to school every morning. I tell A that until she can assure me that I will not have contact with K, I am not returning to campus because I don't feel safe. She eventually agrees for B to be my \"point of contact\" instead of K while the investigation is going on. Those couple of weeks, I had to sit through meetings with B and U where U would just scream at me the entire time and B would try to calm her down.. but, they were the most peaceful I had ever had that school year because K was no longer harassing me. \n\nBut good things don't last, so A tells me that she has concluded her investigation and has found that all the adverse actions I have faced is due to my lack of success as a teacher. What did I expect? Soon, time for resignation approaches and I choose to resign for the upcoming school year. But, I'm still seeking justice bevause I cannot imagine another teacher (especially someone who doesn't have anyone experienced in their family) going through this hell. I talk to my teacher union but the dates of my membership makes them unable to help me with the situation so they refer me to the EEOC. I also get in touch with Workers Comp (who later calls me back and tells me that my principal was only trying to help and now I'm retaliating). But, EEOC tells me to continue documenting everything and to contact them again at the end of the school year. \n\nSkip to the last 3 weeks of school... K and B come down and tell me that I haven't scheduled my final appraisal so I'll have to do it now. I tell them I refuse because I've been asking for a different appraiser all year. They tell me that they will call HR and get it figured out. Later, B comes back and tells me that HR will also be at the meeting as witness and that we are meeting after school. I show up and managed to get all my ratings moved up  on the appraisal because of the evidence I present and K feels pressured since there are 2 witnesses. Then, A tells me that there are district employees that feel threatened by me so they are placing me on paid leave for the last 2 weeks. They take my keys, laptop, and that's it. I have to come pick up all my things about a week or so later and I'm not allowed to talk to anyone other than A (according to the letter the \"superintendent\" sent). I also talked to a school board member who says that what I went through was awful but there's nothing he can do. \n\nI can't get in touch with EEOC in my area but I have time for that... I still plan on bringing ally evidence to them as well. My current issue is that I just got 2 job offers and accepted one. However, when the new principal called K, she spewed all the same BS about me. So much for starting over... Like it wasn't bad enough she harassed me and ruined the year before. The principal wants to risk hiring me... But she admits that now she feels the need to have her eye on me. \n\nSo, that's why I'm here. All school year and summer I've been trying to advocate for this type of situation and show that WE DONT HAVE ROOM FOR THIS. There is already a HUGE teacher shortage... Why are you trying to get rid of the ones willing to come in and take the challenge?? And you wonder why retention rates are so high??? \n\nI am still being bullied by the district I grew up in and that my parents have served in for years and they're getting away with it. This is a shot in the dark... But I need help. What do you do when no one will listen? I have recordings of almost all of this...even when she said the infamous, \"Do you even want to be a teacher?\". And yes... I've showed this to everyone involved but they chose to ignore it. \n\nPlease help. \n\nLove,\n\nA heartbroken kindergarten teacher",

    "text": "Kids getting consequences...makes them behave? Wow. TLDR: Admin finally backed us up and was shocked that it got the crazy class under control. Flair is contingent on them keeping it up, even though the kids will continue to test worse and worse next week. And probably again after fall break. \n\nMy school is basically a drain school. It's a middle school where we regularly have to remind parents that we don't have student parking, even if your child can drive legally. Kids will get expelled from other places and come here, like it's a halfway house to the alternative school. So of course, there's a horrible mix of kids who need the intense structure of military school and poor kids doing their absolute best. \n\nAdd to that all the special ed kids are in our team, because they could only get 2 special ed teachers for 7th grade--one for math, on for ELA. \n\nAdd to that they took a class with 12 special ed students and put all the behavior students in there too. \n\nIt's a madhouse. No one can handle them. They'll call the principal a bitch to her face and then their mom will swear that she's lying on them. \n\nWe are also a school that \"does PBIS\" AKA we're always told to buy kids candy and ice cream and pizza if they \"try\" (read--don't try at all) because not giving them rewards even when they don't meet expectations discourages them. No restorative circles. No goal setting classes. They still expect us to act like it's a hardass school where no one takes shit. It's just that when they get to admin they get a 10 minute time out for nearly killing each other. \n\nI finally got admin to give me one week of reasonability. If I've called parents and documented that this has happened before, the kid spends the day in ISS. If they cuss at a teacher, 2 days ISS. Refusal? ISS. Fights? OSS. No exceptions. If I send a kid to admin, they don't come back until the end of the day at least. \n\nShe came by expecting to see them going crazy today. She walked in to them silently taking their test 40 minutes in. Why? Because at the 6 minute mark a girl went to admin. And by the 15 minute mark she hadn't come back. \n\nThey saw their friends not coming because they were suspended. When she came in I just raised a brow. \n\nWe've been given permission to keep it up for that class instead of her plan, which was to split them up and ruin every other period instead of learning self management. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not write up happy. I hate doing this. But when kids are saying \"Write me up, I'll go sit in Mr. X's room.\" or \"I'm thirsty. Write me up so Mr. X will give me a sprite\" and flat saying that they think the admin is a joke, something has to change. I work in the classroom when I can. Last year I didn't have a single write up. Student's fidgeting? I find things for them to do more quietly like teaching them to twirl pencils. Student cusses me out? It's usually because they'd rather be in ISS than struggling to do my work, I show them that they can type out questions on our monitoring service and I can answer them for the whole class without anyone knowing they asked it. Kid is hungry? I keep bananas. People joke that I'm best with girls on probation who hate their mom because a lot of the \"problem\" girls are perfectly fine in my class. \n\nBut some kids just never got home training and after a year and a half virtual they'll have to get it at school.",

The speaker brought up a point I deem asinine and I’m hoping a veteran teacher in this thread can provide me with some clarity. This teacher said when we are disrespected by a student in front of the class we should just ignore it instead of address it. Their logic is by calling a student out for their disrespect it’s what they want. So by ignoring it we are not giving them attention. Therefore It should stop. Now while I’m getting a bunch of mixed And aIn my eyes stupid signals from this. I want to know what you as educators think of this theory. Thank you and have a great day",

Although being young (35) I'm very qualified for the position I am in. I started  this job 10 months ago. Out of 32 employees who I manage, I'm having trouble with one employee who will not provide updates to me on projects that have been assigned to her. I asked her to come to my office to discuss the status of certain projects. When we met I asked her how things were going with one of the accounts her response to me was \"I don't like you, I don't like your personality, and I have a problem with someone like you managing me\". I asked her what she meant by that, she stammered for a moment and said \"your age\". Then she said I should take her out to lunch to get her to know me better because she thinks I act like I'm better than her, and that I talk down to her. I responded that I'm not going to do that but my door is always open if she wants to talk. At that point she stormed out out of my office and went to our most Senior manager to complain about me. She said I was rude to her. My Senior manager reprimanded me and said I need to be kind to our employees because they are complaining about you. I told her what transpired in my office prior to that employee going to her. I also asked her to please provide and example of when I've said or done something rude or disrespectful to any employee. She could not name a single instance. I also asked her who other than that single employee has complained about me. She couldn't name any other person. I feel unsupported my the Senior manager. I'm not the type of person to pull out the race card but I think this employee is racist and doesn't like the idea of a black person managing her. She said her issue was my age, regardless which it is she is still prejudice. Why is it my job to make this employee like me in order for her to do the job she was hired to do? I don't understand why my boss can't just support me and let the employee know that she needs to provide the information I need in order to insure the clients are being taken care of. This  employee has created issues for me on several different occasions. Bad mouthing me to other managers and other employees. Other than this one employee everything else is great.

I did my graduate internship at a very large company and after that I got offered a very good position.\nI didn't have any previous experience but all my supervisors were very happy with my performance and even the VP of the company congratulated me on the job offer. I am 23 years old and my position is Junior Manager.\n\nWhen I got offered the job it was in the middle of Covid and I didn't negotiate my salary, just accepted what they gave me.\nAfter 1 year I decided to talk to my supervisor, I had already received a personal email from the VP of the department and my Area Director congratulating me for the great performance I was having and I had found out that previous people with my position used to get paid 5k more than I am currently getting paid.\n\nI also found out that people in the same department but with different (less important) job functions (where I did my internship) where getting paid around 2/3k more than I was.\n\nMy next position in the rat race would be manager, and the only difference really is the title. Apparently before Junior were managing only 2 accounts, and there weren't really big or important accounts, yet still they were getting paid 5k more.\nWhen they hired me I guess due to staffing shortage they gave me the same workload as the managers, I have been managing 5 accounts 3 of them big and important and I have been doing an excellent job. The same number of accounts and with an overall similar portfolio value than the people with the manager position are managing. \nTake into account that managers are making minimum 8/9k more than I currently make.\n\nKnowing all this and that my results were very good I went to ask my supervisor for a raise.\nMy strategy was the following, instead of directly asking for a raise, I asked him what did he thought I could improve in order to get the promotion.\n\nHe admitted that I have been doing an awesome job and that the job I have been doing is the exact same as of the managers so he sees me already as one, but that due to my age I may need to wait a bit longer to get that promotion.\nI said okay I understand and I am not trying to be pushy but in anyway I would like a salary increase, I told him look I know I am being underpaid and I love this company  I am not trying to leave or anything but I am scared that given that I already started with a below the average salary even if I get a promotion next year I am always earning behind what the range for the position is, in order to reduce this risk and because as you said I have been doing the same work as the managers I would like a 5k increase.\n\nHe said that he would talk with my direct boss but that maybe it's better to wait a bit longer before asking and that I shouldn't ask him because he will talk to him (they are personal friends).\nNow my supervisor is leaving, and I don't know what to do, should I just go talk to the area director and ask him for the raise? I like the company and my colleagues but I am getting very burned out knowing that they are basically taking me for an idiot and not paying me what I deserve, I mean there are fucking morons that are doing shit that are getting paid more than me, while me on the other hand I can't even move out of my parents house with the money they pay me",

(USA)  Writing this at 4AM on a Saturday because this has me so pissed off I can't sleep. \n\nI've been with my current company and in role (sales) working remote for almost two years now. No raise. No promotion. My metrics are good and my 4Q rolling avg is above 100% despite selling hardware in a pandemic. I recently moved to a new team within the company that covers the west coast, whereas before I covered the east coast. My new team has been very accepting of me and I truly feel like I have a support system with them. We help each other, encourage each other, and because of me, we now have regular happy hours that people seem to really enjoy. It's a good team. \n\nMy new boss, well... It's a mixed bag. Up until this last week, he and I *seemed* to get along pretty well. He was openly passionate about helping me move into my next role and get me a promotion. And while he's not the biggest stud, he's unapologetically himself (much like myself) and a decent guy. That said, there is a new tool our team has been beta testing for working leads. His boss has a lot of personal investment in it's success, and he REALLY wants to keep her happy and be the golden child among the other managers. But, the tool sucks. \n\nIt has potential, it needs some work and some glitches/features refinement, but it could be good. It's just not. Yet. My manager has been asking for feedback for the tool, but everytime feed back and critism is given, whether it's in a team meeting or 1 on 1, he has gotten very defensive and borderline aggressive. Cut to: how I got into this present situation.\n\nLast Thursday I had my own 1x1 with him. It started well, we talked pipeline numbers and every thing was fine. Then the conversation switched to the tool, specifically how I haven't used it as much as others on the team. He began making accusations, such as \"you think you're above doing leads\" and, \"are you smarter then the tool?\" I calmly noted that his rhetoric was coming off aggressive and assuming of my intentions. I tried to explain that the tool is buggy and slow, and isn't always the best use of time. But he interrupted me (something he has a tendency to do) and stated that he would watch me work all day next Wednesday so he can see how buggy it is and how else I use my time (all via zoom and screen share).\n\nI agreed to keep peace and because it doesn't waste my time; I'll just go about my day. But the more and more I think about it, it's infuriating that I'm being punished for simply providing feedback. And I'll be lucky if he doesn't stop me periodically throughout the day and go on rants about what I'm doing (he also has a habit of ranting). It just seems very unprofessional, absurd, and textbook micromanaging. The good news is I have two interviews this next week, one for a company that'd pays double what I'm making now. But if I don't get it, I'm stuck here in this crummy position. And he has definitely withdrawn his support for my promotion (another story, but it's in writing). And either way I still have to be watched all day Wednesday. Am I crazy? Or am I gaslighting myself and this is a HUGE red flag? What is appropriate course if action?\n\nTL:DR manager struggles with feedback on new tool his boss wants to succeed. Becomes aggressive and now wants to watch me work all day via zoom, possibly as retaliation (?).",

I turned it down before, since I was pursuing my degree at the time, but they’ve always left the idea open for me. \n\nMy professional career is honestly pretty good- I’ve been fortunate to obtain a ton of training and experience, with a bit of luck along the way. I’ve done interesting projects, I have a decent mix of office and field work which I’ve always intended on doing. \n\nBut I truly miss the fast-pace and controlled chaos that is a restaurant. Field work doesn’t compare to the pace of a kitchen, and I can’t get over the fact that I prefer being overly busy rather than being sedentary at a desk or performing inspections for a client for the umpteenth time. I also like the idea of challenging myself with managing a team, developing a menu, and having direct competition with other businesses. \n\nI don’t know. Kinda just ranting at this point. But am I crazy for thinking I’d be happier running a busy restaurant rather than having a stable job in a boring industry?",

    "text": "Career ideas if I like puzzles and challenges? Right so I realise the title kind of makes it seem like I enjoy racing against the clock to do jigsaws but hear me out.\n\nWhen I say I like puzzles I mean I enjoy basically anything where I have to figure out what the problem is, why something isn't working, how to fix/solve it, how to improve efficiency.\n\nI pretty much can't stand any work where there isn't a challenge, but I can also make a challenge out of almost anything. I worked in a factory for 2 summers packing 25 mini packets into a bag, then 10 bags into a box and stacking it onto a pallet. I broke the company record for most packing done in a day (several times), reshuffled my tasks to make it more efficient, and found a way to stack the (slightly wrong shape/size) pallets that was more stable. It was boring and I really, really want more variety in career work, but I'm pretty good at creating challenges, as long as there's some quantitative measure I can use.\n\nI'm decent at working with other people but previous jobs have taught me that I'll be miserable if I'm always working with customers. \n\nI'll be graduating in the summer with at least a 2:1 in law + Spanish from a decent uni, I've done temp jobs and have a year running a charity project at uni that involved managing a group of volunteers and coordinating with funding providers, directors, etc.\n\nRight now I'm just applying for random jobs but I'd love to have a bit more direction.

    "text": "How do you get out of retail management? Trying this out because I’m feeling desperate, any advice is appreciated. I’ll try to be as specific as possible as to get the best advice. \n\nI’m 28 years old, I have my bachelors in psychology(kind of useless I know) and I’ve worked in big box retail for 8 years, management for 5. I’m a mom of 2 little boys who are only 1 and 2 years old, they’re 18 months apart. I received my most recent promotion 3 months ago and I feel like it was a huge mistake. I’m taking the position behind someone who was very well liked but let a lot of things slide that hurt the business and I’m cleaning up their mess, not to mention Christmas in retail is emotionally scarring for everyone involved. I’m a salaried manager with 3 leaders under me and probably about 80 team members. I’m required to work a minimum of 50 hours a week and almost all of my peers at other stores do more than that. \n\nMy first huge issue is the work/life balance, it’s not there. If I’m sick, I’m expected to be there, not to mention anything involving the kids. You’re judged hard for taking any kind of sick or personal day, but the worst part is that if I do it really details my business due to payroll allocation being so bad in January. They literally need bodies in the building. \n\nMy second huge issue is how powerless I feel as a manager. When I took the job, one of my subordinates told me they wanted to be fired so they could collect unemployment. They talk loudly and frequently about how much they hate the job, but the company is SO afraid of being sued that I have no ability to fire at will. I have to go through a loooong grueling performance management process, and it has to be perfectly in line with company expectation(that I was barely trained on) or I can’t even write them up. I also recently had an employee call out corporate HR and tell them I’m racist with completely and entirely made up examples of me being racist, outright made up. I know it’s hard to believe people in the internet when they say this, but they’re lying. And the higher ups know they’re lying, but again I cannot do anything about this, their recommendation is that I never speak to this person in private even as they spread lies to people about me. I’m very upset about not being able to defend my character. I’m literally in a mixed race relationship, which I know doesn’t automatically mean I’m not racist but still. \n\nAs for the job, I lead our entire salefloor operations: inbound, general merchandise, food, and in store fulfillment. I run a $30M process. I am wildly passionate about team development and have helped get a few of my employees promoted, I’m also very results driven and skilled in finding stopgaps in processes. \n\nI’m looking for something with more work life balance, less office politics, and maybe something that doesn’t require me to work every weekend.",

As embarrassing as this would sound, it took 6 years (instead of 4) to complete my engineering because of backlogs and my apathy towards the course which I ironically enrolled for (Electronics and communication).\n\nTo top it off, I have now had a 2 year gap on top of this already 6 year long degree, in which I've learnt nothing of relevance or worked anywhere. To be brutally honest this has been a result of of mix between a lot of familial problems and procrastination/apathy towards the situation from my side, I have no point in hiding that fact at this point in my life.\n\nThere's no doubt that I acknowledge the fact that these roadblocks will prove to be a struggle to deal with if I intended to begin a career afresh from scratch, especially at 26 with no experience whatsoever.\n\nBut come as late as it may have, I really want to put the past behind me right now. I really don't want these roadblocks to bog me down in my endeavors which I put in beginning from NOW. Right now I feel like I have the zeal to work my socks off and excel in whatever I want to pursue in life beginning from this moment.\n\nThe only issue I face is the lack of a proper career guidance given the context of where I am in my life right now. I pretty much don't have any friends/relatives who I can interact with on this nor do I have access to career counsellors where I live.\n\nI have been vacillating between management and software fields, not really certain would be a better path. At this point, to me it's more than where I can excel in than what I specifically find interesting, don't think I have the luxury to that at this stage.\n\nGiven the context of my background and with me being 26 right now, what should be the field I should be picking so as to still excel in making a career moving forward?\n\nI would really appreciate it even more if someone could guide me on this with context to Indian job industry or any advice in general would be appreciated too.",

    "text": "Please don't neglect your communication skills in favor of improving your leetcode skills One thing I found that doesn't appear enough on this SR is communication. I tend to see any variation of \"Is this offer good?\" or, \"Why do I have to grind leetcode?!\". Most of the on-the-job posts consist of \"I am in a toxic environment\" or \"Should I change jobs?\"\n\nI have a piece of career advice for anyone who is fairly new to the field that I think could prove helpful. \n\nFirst, a little about me as while I'm not going to hinder my anonymity I do feel I'm in a position where I can rightly prescribe advice to newer SE's / grads / those still school: I'm a Principal Engineer, and have a wide array of experience across operations (including release / implementation) as well as experience developing user-facing code, and internal tooling used organization-wide. I've worked in the DOD, networking space, e-commerce, and fin-tech. \n\nJobs I've held include:\n\n* Software engineer (senior/staff/principal)\n* DevOps Engineer\n* Lead DevOps engineer\n* Lead Site Reliability Engineer\n* Tech Lead\n* Software Development Manager\n* Director of Operations\n\nOne of the greatest skill deficiencies I see in engineers has always been communication. Communication is a very important part of our job. It allows us to promote our ideas, defend our solutions, play the Devil's Advocate, request help, refuse help, patronize others as well as compliment them. We can use communication to self-promote or self-deprecate. Communication literally sets us apart from every other species on this planet; that's not to say other species can't communicate, but that you won't see one chimpanzee explaining to another what the functional use of a blow-hole in Blue Whales is after explaining the nuances in their childrens' respective behavior while foraging for food. \n\nHere is a hard reality for many engineers: ***Even if you are the best software developer at your entire company, getting others (employees, external customers, internal customers) to actually use what you wrote is a different beast than writing a tool.***\n\nHere is another hard reality: ***Many tasks rely on others to \"un-block us\". There are of course times when the blocker is stubborn enough that solid communication doesn't help, but solid communication never hurts.*** \n\nIt's not uncommon for a developer to feel like a priority queue that relies on other priority queues which are poorly optimized, and plagued with race-conditions. \n\nBelow are some points I'd like to make on the subject of communication:\n\n**Being direct is not mutually exclusive with being polite**. I often find overtly rude people fall on the \"I'm just direct and straightforward!\" excuse as though it actually is an excuse for their rudeness. Consider different ways to say the same thing. This SR, and many others, while not inherently controversial (rudeness is often derived from controversial topics), is plagued with what I'd call \"direct rudeness\". Most of us who have posted here at one point or another have been faced with someone who disagreed but failed to do so in a way that made us feel any productive discussion was possible. \n\nConsider the following two versions of the same sentence (email threads I've actually witnessed, redacted of course):\n\n>Hello \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, you are writing a tool that duplicates work done in a tool I've already written. You need to do a better job of communicating what you're working on so we aren't constantly creating duplicate work and wasting time.\n\nHowever, consider had it been structured slightly differently:\n\n>Hello \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, I noticed you're contributing to a tool which I found here(assume a link to source). I'd like to learn more about your specific needs and perhaps discuss whether $TOOL\\_I\\_ALREADY\\_WROTE would fit them, and if not perhaps we could discuss continuing your thread of work towards enhancing the existing tool-set by adding any features you find it's lacking, as there is certainly some overlap. It'd be great if we could avoid duplicate efforts and enhance a tool that's already in use by the organization. Let me know your thoughts.\n\nBoth sentences communicate the same message, but the former puts the recipient on the defensive and immediately raises a few barriers in their mind. Upon receiving it they will be texting / chatting most of their close-colleagues about what a jerk you were. You turned your potential meeting on the topic into a street brawl instead of a discussion. Sometimes it can work out, but why cause additional stress? \n\nI'd argue that the second version of the sentence still gets the point across but puts the recipient and relative ease and opens a dialogue. To expand upon it a bit more in the second version we acknowledge that the recipient is writing a tool, and raise the concern on the overlapping functionality of that tool with an existing one. The purpose of the email is clearly stated as a goal; avoiding overlap. It's not an accusation but a goal and the use of 'we' puts a collective goal in the recipient's mind. Closing with \"Let me know your thoughts.\" opens a dialogue whereas the over-directness of the first version never actually indicates any interest in a dialogue or common goal.\n\n**Everyone is busy, even when they aren't.** We all need things from colleagues, and some colleagues are naturally more busy than others, and some seem like they're never actually working on anything. It's not our job as developers / individual contributors to judge another's workload (and if it is you should evaluate your company's situation). Many things are cyclical and you may be faced with situations where you need a thing done by someone you do not particularly enjoy working with. I have found strategies in communicating with such people that have been effective, for the most part. \n\nPeople love when you acknowledge \"how busy they are\" even when they aren't ever really busy from your perspective. Consider two people asking you for help:\n\n>Hey \\_\\_\\_\\_, can you please do \\_\\_\\_\\_ for me? This is very urgent and blocking $IMPORTANT\\_THING.\n\nConsider that your $IMPORTANT\\_THING isn't always their $IMPORTANT\\_THING. Your emergency isn't always theirs. In a company that is unified it certainly should be, and we should all be empathetic and helpful when we can and have the bandwidth, but it's not always the hand we're dealt. Consider this slight change:\n\n>Hey \\_\\_\\_\\_, I know you're really busy and I'm sorry to bother you! We have an urgent ongoing issue and I'd really, really appreciate it if you could take some time to look!\n\nKeep in mind these are all suggestions and things that have worked for me, but I've had much better luck with using the second version over the first. To reiterate: People love to appear busy. Especially at work. I don't know what it is about perpetually being busy, but it's a badge of honor in our work culture and to not be busy is to not be relevant. ***Also keep in mind that you yourself are not a metric by which to judge people. If you put in 80 hours a week at your salaried job, that's your prerogative. Do not hold that expectation of others.***\n\n**Strong opinions are still opinions.** This one is very relevant in our field as there are many subjects which are inherently based on opinions which draw a lot of controversy. Spaces vs tabs, programming syntax, which language to use, which tools to use, log formatting, etc.. Sometimes we're opinionated about the problems that need to be solved. Do they need to be solved? What's the reason we're solving it?\n\nAlways be self-aware of when you're prescribing your opinion vs. when you're prescribing factual-based information. Pick your battles. If you like tabs, and the project uses spaces, that is not the battle to pick. It's not even really worth a mention unless you can do it without being a jerk. If you want to prescribe your strong opinions onto others then be prepared to back up why you wish to do so.\n\nI recommend being objective, always. Do not make statements that cannot be backed up with other objective statements and explanations.\n\nIdentify why you're so strongly opinionated. Can you present your opinion in a way which shows it derives some mutual benefit?\n\nSometimes one opinion can be stronger than another opinion but this is usually rooted in **facts or history.** For example, the spaces vs. tabs talk is inherently based on opinion. If you walk into a project which uses tabs, and you are a spaces person, you ***do not just reformat the whole project to spaces. This will only make you appear to be an asshole.*** This is also a case where your ***opinion is wrong. Not in that one is superior to the other, but the fact that now when I run a diff in SCM across to revisions, you just created a shit-ton of change where there actually was none, making debugging harder and all because you felt your opinion was superior.*** \n\n**In closing -** I just wanted to possibly help some others in their communication style by providing some examples where I saw what I'd consider communication miss / failure, and examples that have personally worked wonders for me. I'm open to any additional input / advice / suggestions that could help others, as well, including if you want to indicate anywhere you disagree with the things I've said and make suggestions I might not have considered.\n\nJust always be aware that if you aren't communicating at your job, something is wrong. If you aren't communicating ***effectively*** then you are going to hit unnecessary hurdles in your career; a career that is inherently difficult to navigate given the constant churn on technological advancement / changes. I highly recommend any new engineer to host as many lunch and learns, and project demos as they can (code you wrote, tools you wrote, etc..) to improve these skills early in their career, as it will pay massive dividends in the years to come. As for written communication, if you are communicating something that feels edgy / difficult, then sit on it for a bit and proof-read / reread it. Pretend you're the recipient and how you'd respond if you received it from yourself. Consider your relationship with the person you're sending to, and how they respond to and consume various types of communication. Always be learning about your peers and learn how to navigate their personalities in ways that increases your success without inhibiting theirs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.",

    "text": "You don't have to be a Software Engineer I'm posting my experience moving from software engineering to sales engineering because I'm seeing a lot of posts from people who are unhappy with software engineering or even just worried if software engineering is the right career for them; **you don't have to be a software engineer.** \n\n**TLDR:** Knowing how to develop software opens the door to many other roles, and many roles would benefit from having someone who knew how to code. I used to be a software engineer, but now I'm having way more fun as a sales engineer. I have friends who became UX/UI designers, and their frontend development knowledge really helps with prototyping. These are just a few examples of alternative roles. \n\n------\n\n\nI studied computer engineering and then worked full time as a software engineer for 2 years. I loved working on projects in college, but I hated working as a software engineer; I went from working on fun projects where I had a lot of control over the project to mostly maintaining code. It sucked having little say in the projects I was working on. \n\nA **lot** of my close friends started switching over to client-facing engineering roles; we were always really social, but coding all day wasn't our thing. I left my software engineering role and joined a start-up as a **post-sales engineer** (an engineer focused on supporting a GTM team *after* the prospect signs a deal) at a SaaS startup. \n\nThe pay was the same as my software engineering role, but I only spent about 30% of my day coding. I spent the rest of the day working with customers and collaborating with other post-sales & engineering teams. The work consisted of integrating our product with theirs to troubleshooting our product for a customer. It was refreshing going from coding all day to client-facing communication. \n\nI left the company and joined as a **pre-sales engineer** (an engineer focused on supporting a GTM team *before* the prospect signs a deal) at another SaaS company recently. Similar to the last role, there isn't lots of coding involved, but this role is focused on convincing prospects that our tool was the right tool for them. Because of that, the role is a lot more flexible and engaging, and I have a lot of control over how I want to tackle each prospect. I also have a lot more say in how our organization/company operates since I'm exposed to EPD and our prospects directly.\n\nThis job is what I loved about college, and I'm glad I was able to find it. I'm hoping those who are discouraged by software engineering take some time to research some other roles that involve coding. My example is just me going to a client-facing engineering role, but I have friends who transitioned to UX/UI design, data science, marketing analytics, sales ops, etc. There are tons of roles where your software development skills would come in handy. \n\nOf course, you'll need to develop the additional skills to succeed in the role, but you might already have those skills in your belt. For example, if you're outspoken and good at explaining complex concepts to non-technical people, you have what it takes to be a sales engineer.\n\n-----\n\nFor those who are interested in client-facing engineering roles, there are **tons** of different names for the roles, and companies often use the same names for different types of roles (a solutions engineer can be post-sales at one company and pre-sales at another). I'm going to share some names I've seen for these types of roles for you to search up yourself. You can also mix and match a bunch of these words and find similar roles lol.\n\nPartner Engineer, Sales Engineer, Solutions Engineer, Solutions Consultant, Solutions Architect, Technical Sales Engineer, Technical Account Manager, Customer Success Engineer, Success Architect\n\n-------\n\n**Edit:** I'm just sharing my experience with those who might be in the same boat as me. I'm not saying my experience is the right way to do things.",

    "text": "Revature: A comprehensive, no BS review Hello all. From my experience, there is a lot of unclear, mixed, and odd information on Revature online, specifically on this subreddit. I am going to write this review of Revature (my experience thus far) in attempt to publicly clear some of it up. I hope this will benefit some of you. The following two paragraphs will be an introduction to what Revature does; skip them if you are already familiar.\n\n**WHAT IS REVATURE?**\n\nWhat is Revature? Revature is a sort of hybrid combination of employment agency and software engineering/coding bootcamp. It is marketed as the bridge between the infamous “2+ years experience” requirement you see on “entry level” jobs and people without said experience. Revature is not the only company that does this; there are others like them. FDM Group is one I can name off the top of my head. But Revature undoubtedly is the most well-known, likely because they have somehow managed to post job listings on nearly every job board in seemingly every city in the US. And guess what those listings are titled? Yep, “entry level software engineer. No experience needed!”\n\nThey have recruiters who guide you through easy little entry interviews to get you signed up for a training start date. These trainings usually take place on a few college campuses, I *think* mostly in the East and South US. Florida, Virginia, West Virginia, Texas.  *As of writing, all of the trainings are happening remotely due to the pandemic; mine was remote*. If you do not have much experience with coding, they will tell you that you have to do a 2-4 week online live class called Spark, and this training is completely unpaid and contract free. After you pass that, you can qualify for one of the bootcamp trainings, during which you get 10 days contract free and then are told you have to sign to continue. After training, you go to a staging phase where Revature works to find you positions with various companies and get your interviewed for them. These companies are almost entirely massive companies, a lot of Fortune 500s. Revature then pays you 45k (more if in high COL) your first year of work, and then 55k your second year of work (also more if high COL). They then will offer you a third year contract free if you want, and that’s 75k salary. You are offered a small stipend to help cover moving costs when moving to on-site training and job sites.\n\nIn short, Revature trains people (a \\~3 month bootcamp) in various techs and then contracts them out to companies to work for 2 years. And you’re paid for the entire experience. They really do this; it’s not a scam. But there are some catches and some sketchy things that I will address.\n\n**THE CONTROVERSIAL THINGS**\n\nIt mostly sounds marvelous, right? What’s the catch? The *big* one you’ve probably already heard of is the contract and how it works. The contract has all these little conditions you aren’t supposed to break, the main one being that you can’t just up and leave once you’ve signed their contract. If you do break the contract, they say you will be charged with a whopping 46k. It used to be less and they recently have increased this.\n\nAnother catch is that you are basically paid minimum wage until you actually start a job for whatever company they contract you out to. That means that during the bootcamp and the staging phase (which usually ranges anywhere between 1-3 months), you will make very little. And on top of that, your 2 year clock on the contract doesn’t start until your first day with a client. This means training and staging time does not count towards that 2 years, even though you’re still locked in at that point.\n\nPerhaps the worst catch of all is what I see as the Revature nightmare situation. This has to do with a mixture of being locked into that contract and being moved around geographically. Technically, the clients you are contracted out to are often bringing you on for big projects. Rarely, someone will reach completion of the project and the company will then say “k, we’re done with you then” and send you back to Revature, where you are placed back in the staging phase where you will again make minimum wage. That is, until they find you another company to go work for or until you’ve been in staging for \\~3 months (and they then let you go penalty-free).  You could also get sent back if the client doesn’t like you, but you have to be a big underperformer or do something bad for this to occur otherwise Revature will fight for you to keep you in your position.  But during non-pandemic times, this literally means you would have to move from your training site where you are in staging, to the job site where your client is located, and then back to the training site again when they are done with you. Yes, you can a small stipend to help cover moving costs, but Revature doesn’t give a damn if you have to break leases or eat big costs for long-term stays at Airbnbs. With Revature you have to be light on your feet, and you could be sent across the country at a week’s notice. There’s a lot of geographic unknown.  And who knows, maybe they are more reasonable with this than I’m giving them credit for.  I never personally spoke with anyone who went through this, I just know it is possible in theory.  In most cases, you go to your project and you stay there the whole time, problem free.\n\nThe pay is also, without a doubt, fairly low.  People also rage about this.  Being a software engineer getting paid 45k isn’t wonderful, but it’s just for one year, and it’s enough to live off of.  The value of Revature isn’t the salary, it’s the resume building and the increase of the future value of your salary.  Maybe you can go get a job making 60k for the next 4 years, or maybe Revature will pay you 45k for year 1, 55k for year 2, and then you go land a job making 100k afterward.  Maybe not, who knows, but you get what I’m saying here.  Be real with yourself and consider how much you’d be missing out on if you didn’t do Revature.  If you’re like me, you wouldn’t be missing out on anything.\n\nLastly, I’ll mention that you don’t usually get to pick what tech you are trained in.  I had no idea what I would be trained in until day 1 of my paid training.  Some people I spoke with mentioned that their recruiter gave them a choice.  Mine didn’t, but it worked out fine.  Revature is only training people in tech that they believe employers see as marketable, otherwise they can’t sell you to them.  This is how Revature works for you, and they’re looking out for you during that entire 2 years because they win when you win.\n\nSo that’s the bad. When you hear people badmouthing Revature, they usually stop here.  But let me tell you: for me and man others, the good far outweighs the bad. *Virtually no one gets stuck with the contract breakage fee, even people who actually break the contract*. I think it’s obvious as to why. The contract is, to a degree, a scare tactic that has to be in place for Revature’s business to be possible, otherwise people would take their paid training and then scoot off to do their own thing. But they are transparent about it, they went over the contract with us many times, and we all knew what we were getting into. Sure, in a perfect world that breakage fee wouldn’t be there, but if you just don’t break the contract, there’s never going to be any issue at all. If something does happen like they can’t find you a job, they literally will just tear your contract in two and say “you’re free to go.” They do not try to stick people with it, it’s just meant to keep people on their track for 2 years and that’s it. I know of absolutely no one who has gotten threatened or stuck with the fee.\n\nThe minimum wage thing is often blown **WAY** out of proportion too. People rage about how Revature is so awful for paying you minimum wage, but you have to remember that *you are literally being paid to learn.* Imagine if you had gotten paid to go take college CS courses, wouldn’t that be great? Instead, you had to pay out of your butt for tuition. Bootcamps are like this too, usually! You pay a massive 10k+ sum of money and just hope that what you got taught will land you a job. With Revature, not only do you not have to pay a fat sum of cash, you will actually *make* cash while learning, and it puts the incentive on them to ensure that they are teaching you stuff that will actually make YOU money and land YOU jobs, because they have to sell you. And besides, you’re only going to be paid minimum wage for a few months. That is extremely short term, and then you begin to make a living wage. The bootcamp and staging pay is just meant to allow you to not go into debt and to put food on the table until you get to the actual job.\n\n**MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE**\n\nI do not have a computer science degree.  I majored in business and had little to no coding experience previously, just some experience with VBA when messing around with Excel and maybe like 2 hours experience with Javascript.  I had to do their initial 4 month unpaid class and that just solidified for me how much I liked doing this stuff.  I started getting into Revature right as the pandemic was getting bad so I had a few bumps concerning that, but in the end, Revature trained me in a fantastic, relevant, modern tech that I love doing.  I pretty quickly went from training to getting a real software engineering job with a real tech company, even without a CS degree.  I’m a couple months into my project/actual job now and I’m really liking it.  Coworkers are great and the job is going to look great on my resume.  And on top of all this, I now have a network of bright blooming software engineers from my training batch.  They’re going to all kinds of companies and I keep in touch with them.  Teaching myself would not have given me this.\n\nDuring training, I was working extremely hard and at most was doing like 15 hour days.  Definitely worked weekends, though they aren’t paid.  However, later in the training, my work hours plummeted and I would sometimes only be working for 4 hours a day.  Note that you’re paid for that 8 hours a day, nothing more nothing less.  The training varies based on your trainer and how he or she wants to do things.  Mine liked to lecture for around half the day and then leave the rest of the day open for us to do some self teaching and to experiment and work on projects.  I liked this approach, as our trainer was still completely open and available for questions and consultation even after releasing us.  Think of training like it is a very full college semester, except you’re getting paid for it.\n\nRevature WILL release you if you do not perform well in training, but they won’t make you pay the fee.  It’s not all hand holding either, so you really have to keep your head down and focus and work hard during that training.  The people in my batch who were already software engineers found the training to be easy overall, whereas people like myself found it to be hard.  It varies between people.  It was challenging doing it 100% remote, but you get used to it after a while and start to appreciate it too.\n\nDuring staging, you’re “supposed” to be working for 8 hours a day to practice on your own and stuff, but most everyone just slacks off and collects the 8 hours of pay while they wait for interviews.  Just how it is.\n\nAnd then after that, it’s just the job for the next 2 years!  This is when you finally get paid the living wage.  You hardly even interact with Revature at this point, they just pay you.\n\n**BOTTOM LINE**\n\nRevature is a great opportunity if you’re like me and want to get into the tech field and don’t have a CS degree and you can manage possibly having to work on the other side of the country. It has its downsides like every job does and Revature has a lot it needs to improve, but none of these cons are enough to lead me to tell you to avoid it. If you already have a CS degree, I don’t really know why you’d be trying to get into Revature. Many of my fellow trainees are not as happy with Revature as I am because they didn’t get nearly as much out of training, *because they already knew how to do most of what we were taught*. They are extremely overqualified. If you have your CS degree, pick a marketable tech and do your own projects and push them to GitHub. Apply to jobs everywhere. Otherwise, if you’re fine with making a bit less for a measly 2 years, then yes, Revature will be a fine option to get you over that entry-level job hump that we all dread.\n\nI'll be glad to speak on anything you have questions about.  Drop me a comment and I'll respond.\n\nAnd finally, *if you found this review helpful and are going to sign up for Revature,* I do have a referral link that will yield me a bonus. You don’t have to use it, and I’m not making this review to advertise it, but I’d greatly appreciate it if you did and it would be a great way to thank me. If you’ve already signed up, I’d appreciate it if you asked your recruiter if you could apply the referral link to your profile nonetheless.  I'd prefer to not leave it out here publicly though, and will provide it to you via DM if interested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: One guy here has brought up a good point, and that's alternatives.  You can find my comment below where we discuss it, but I want to add here that Capital One's CODA program is another \"hire and train you before putting you to work\" gig that is almost certainly going to be better.  I knew about it and wanted to do it, but they were not hiring.  I was trying to find a job at the start of the pandemic and had very little confidence that they would start hiring again anytime soon.  Check that out and apply to it if you can before doing Revature.",

    "text": "I don't want to keep being in software but I have no other profitable skills I'm in my mid-40s and I've worked as a software developer up and down the stack for about 20 years. I have worked at companies ranging from small startups to large companies with in-house dev teams. I would say that I have a very successful career in software and am very confident in my development abilities.\n\nHowever, I now have no desire in continuing doing this until I retire. In the past, I would switch jobs if I reached a plateau in my position and every day started to feel like groundhog day but, after working on many companies in different domains, once the novelty wears off after a few months to a year, it feels like Groundhog Day again. I can't remember how many times I've had the \"branching strategy\" conversation but the last time I had it, it was an epiphany because it was when I realized that I'm expecting different results while I'm doing the same things and I'll be well in my 50s and still be having that conversation in another organisation. I like my colleagues, my managers are nice etc but I feel dread in participating in endless sprint plannings, groomings, estimates, daily stand-ups and legacy code bug fixes for years and years.\n\nI accepted a technical lead position as I felt I reached the ceiling of being a senior dev in my current company. As a senior dev, there is always stuff to learn but at the end of the day, I kept writing the  same if/then/else statements no matter what coding principles and practices I use or what technologies sit above my coding language. Up until that point, I had felt I had been dealing with problems I'd seen a million times before in application development and it was all a circle where someone told me to do something, I did it, I may offer my opinion/objection but not much else would change. Now, I am in a position of more authority to influence the technology department as to what new technologies we want to use going forward, be a mentor to some devs, and get a bird's eye view of the problem at hand.\n\nBut even that hasn't made me feel better. The topics that interest me in programming feel further and further away from my work. In recent years, I took an interest in front-end development, which I don't get to do often commercially. I'd like to learn a language in another programming paradigm too, like a functional one. Also, being a tech lead also comes with its own challenges as I'm often overworked and the onus is more on me to explain and justify sprint goals and defend project timelines.\n\nI have a genuine love of programming and I like to learn new technologies which is why I have been thrusted this far but I feel increasingly bored with application development and it doesn't get any better.\n\nI have been increasingly thinking about my other interests in fitness and arts and have been thinking about how I could earn a decent income out of those but they feel discouraging when I look into them. Effectively, I would be starting from the bottom again and, frankly, it will take me years, if not decades, to make the money I'm making now, either in those fields or anywhere else. At the same time, I think that if I continue in the same trajectory, I'll drive myself up a wall.\n\nI guess I'm just looking for perspectives from other people in this field or people who have dealt with similar \"rat race\" type of situations. Thank you.\n\n**Edit:** I forgot to mention, the next move from technical lead may be to look at becoming a solution architect but after a lot of deliberation I find the prospect very uninspiring as it involves even more meetings, diagram design, endless speccing out of documents etc.",

What do I do? tl;dr: boss I made a HR complaint at (that was acted on) one of my old jobs is being hired at a role senior to me at my new job, I only found out after they extended an offer. What're my options?\n\nThrowaway for very obvious reasons. I'm fuzzing the details a little bit, also for obvious reasons. \n\nOnly seniors and above are in the interview loop in my company, and I'm mid level. I've been here 2.5 years and this is a new change. \n\nOld boss \"inherited\" me at my old job when my first boss left. We never got along before that. Since we worked together at a huge company he did a lot of bureaucratic things to try and \"manage me out,\" like reassign all my work to his other other reports, then write me up for not doing as much as them. There was also definitely a racial component to it because we're different races and he only hired people of his race. \n\nRight around then, I went on FMLA leave because my mother had a stroke. When I came back he had a PIP written up for me, so that plus the racial stuff prompted me to go to HR and amp up my job hunt. I found out he was smack talking me to other people, too. On one of my interviews, the interviewer said \"we don't have use for people who decide to just take six months off because they can't handle the pace.\" This was almost the exact same wording he used, and LinkedIn searching showed me they went to the same school, same major, and same graduating class. I took this to HR and they formally disciplined him, and I saved those emails. \n\nI only found out he was hired today, because during our sprint planning the team lead announced he accepted an offer for a senior engineer role and we marked off some tine to onboard him. \n\nSo what do I do? My boss loves me, I'm scheduled for a promotion, and I have enough savings to sustain a year+ long job hunt, and I have a pretty good resume. But I really have no idea how to bring this to my boss.",

    "text": "How do you plan for a long, technical-focused careeer in CS? >**TL;DR**: How to age into an old fart (but young at heart and brain) in a technical, CS-related career?\n\n(long post ahead)\n\nHi,\n\nAs the title says, I'm curious about what others in this sub would do to build a long career in tech.\n\nThere are two articles mentioning that a CS career could be long-winded:\n\n* [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years (Peter Novig)](https://norvig.com/21-days.html)\n* [A forty year career (Will Larson)](https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/)\n\nFrom this post, I want to learn more about different \"paths\" one can take for a \\~30-year++ career in 2021. In addition, tips on how we could get more out of a long career will be great additions, too.\n\n*To start, I 'll share my take later in the post.*\n\n========================================\n\nIt is definitely welcome to hear from a wide range of experiences. But if you want to focus the discussion, I'm interested in \"paths\" with these traits:\n\n## Lean more towards the technical side (vs people management)\n\nI tend to enjoy concrete work, e.g: writing code, running system, etc. However, things that fall under the \"soft-skill \" umbrella is also OK. I'm just not fond of roles where you end up a meeting-goers every day, letting your technical chop get rusty.\n\n## Reward you for technical \"expertise\"\n\nHere, \"expertise\" means the  ability to solve and understand complex problems in your field.\n\nSome older engineers I know are very good in their field of choice. They also get paid well for it. For example, these fields are: data-center networking, software performance engineering, designing high-availablilty system, writing formally-verified software, etc.\n\nIMO, having expertise in these areas seems like a good way to build your advantage as we age. This is important to not become redudant when faced with hard-working junior colleagues. (It's a sad world like that...).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n========================================\n\n**A blurb about myself (for context)**\n\n* Graduated with a Bachelor in Computer Engineer => background in hardware, low-level software.\n* Self-learnt CS and more trendy industry topics since.\n* Worked as \"full-stack\", then backend dev (APIs, payment, data warehouse/pipelines, IoT).\n* Recently took on devops role for a decently-sized company, running Kubernetes in data centers and clouds.\n* Worked at various company sizes (<50 => 3000+) .\n* Also worked in various industries (video streaming, electrical/utilities, gaming).\n* Have been both individiual contributor and led small teams (3-5 people) unofficially.\n* Above average ToC (\\~130k++ cash in Canada, \\~6 YoE) but nothing too fancy.\n* Generally enjoy CS-related work, but also open about utilizing tech in other industries.\n\n## Thoughts on \"having a long career\"\n\nIn general, I believe it's possible to have a long career in tech (having seen some old and wise engineers myself). Yet, it seems a long career requires good techincal chops and other complimentary skillsets. For example, besides asking hard coding/system design questions, people also expect you to show leadership + communication skills in interviews/day-to-day work.\n\nIMO, the ideal role for me at 10 YoE (mid-30s) would be a Principal/Staff (software) engineer.\n\nIf these [archetypes of staff engineers](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes) are indicative, I aim to be a mix of Tech Lead + Architect + Solver. For example, leading a small team to solve a business-impacting problem would be something interesting.\n\nPast 10 YoE, I don't really know what's else there would be.\n\n**Industry/area of focus**:\n\nI plan to stay in the \"computing infrastructure\" space.\n\n* My experiences are mostly with backends, data-intensive systems right now. This helps build up familiarity with the space.\n* I plan to expand my knowledge in networking, performance engineering soon. In the future, maybe some kernel-related work would be great.\n\nThere's some tenative paths for this area, IMO:\n\n* More **DevOps/SRE** work, hopefully with increasing scale.\n* Specialize in **data-center**: deeper work underneath the \"clouds\". This will need much better networking knowledge, though.\n* Specialize in **kernel/embeded software**. There is transferable knowledge on operating system. But there's a lot more to learn once you are outside the Linux kernel.\n* Specialize in **infra-related areas**: database, data warehouse/pipelines, etc.\n\n**To build up advantages**\n\nThis is what I have been doing so far:\n\n* Keep a hands-on approach to problem solving. For example: participate in on-call rotation, write code and deals with technical debt (mine and others). I also run a home computing lab for experiements.\n* Keep reading/learning. Nowadays, instead of jumping on the industry's latest, I am biased towards more researchy materials. For example books, CS research journal/[the morning paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/), etc.\n* Attempt to acquire novel work-like experiences outside of my dayjob. For example, I help some friends in an NGO with their software-related need.\n* Occasionally crunch some LeetCode to stay fit for medium+ problems.\n* Maintain a light professional network/connections to spot new opportunities.\n\n**On the $$ side**\n\n* Haven't pushed hard for compensation yet, but will start scheduling interviews towards late-2021.\n* I am more concerned about finding a company with good potential (thus problems + money to spend on them). Certain team dynamics/values are also important to me (e.g: value quality work, trusting each other, etc).\n\n==>\n\nIn short, I am betting that \"computing infrastructure\" is not going away soon. Hence, a solid foundation in the field would mean above-average financial outcome. And I get some happiness while being immersed in the area as well.\n\nI am hopeful that this plan will workout. However, sometimes there's a little bit of FOMO on other paths (e.g: AI/Deep learning). Also I see lots of gaps to fill and no quick way out of the rat race :)\n\nHow about you? What are you planning for your career path?",

    "text": "A Look Back At Accounting Advisory Services **TL;DR** \\- I've broken this post up into sections as it's a long read. While public has its faults overall I would say was a net positive on me and my career. AAS I would highly recommend and it worked out well for me working on transactions. Skip to the end to see the exit ops.\n\nEarlier this Fall I accepted an offer in industry and left Accounting Advisory Services at a B4 (e.g. EY FAAS, PwC CMAAS) and wanted to share a reflection on my time in the service line to shed some light for others contemplating joining or currently navigating the service line.\n\n# Background\n\nI graduated from the flagship public state school of my state with a bachelors in accounting. I was fortunate to get a full time offer at a national firm despite having a low GPA, for public anyway, of 3.0 and missing out on internship season the summer right before my Junior year. Part of that was due to spending time on a collegiate team that was a benefit to my resume based on leadership experience that I gained.\n\nI already covered my audit experience in-depth in another thread which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6en96b/my_experience_in_audit/) I won't go in-depth there. I will just say that between the two firms I was at the national firm had much better tech and easier intranet and internal resources to navigate but that the B4 had a few more technical resources. Additionally, I think the experience I got at a national firm was more insightful than the B4 audit experience that many of my AAS colleagues had gotten and from what I observed assisting a handful of audit teams at the B4 I was at. Since the teams aren't as built out at the smaller firms and you need to not just understand a singular part of the audit/financial statements but you need to know how it interplays with other areas of the audit AND you generally get to see more areas instead of being on one section of the audit and learning nothing else but how to audit one section of the financial statements.\n\nAfter 3 busy seasons of audit, one of those as a senior, I was starting to get tired of audit and at the same time I got a cold call from a recruiter at what would be the next firm I would work at which was perfect timing. I only got that call because I had my LinkedIn updated. So I would say keep your resume AND LinkedIn up to date regardless of whether you are/aren't looking. If possible, it's better to leave on your terms because you got a better offer than because you can't stand it anymore or worse you don't have a job.\n\nFrom there I got an interview that was mostly behavioral, I gave some vague examples that I've worked on technical topics and how I work on teams etc. I was a good candidate having 2-3 years of experience and was coming in at a time when ASC 606 and ASC 842 were both about to be widely adopted by public companies who would need AAS assistance on implementation. After about a 3 week process I got an offer for a 20% bump on a non-promotion year. Wanting to still further my career but without much knowledge about where I wanted to go next other than I wanted to be out of audit, I accepted the offer. I left my old firm that summer as an S1 (before year-end reviews were completed) and joined the new firm as an S2 in AAS, so kept on the same promotion track. In general I would say I was an above average performer but certainly not THE top performer. My ratings in general can be characterized as a 4 out 5 where 5 is the top rating.\n\n# Accounting Advisory Services Experience\n\nAfter joining I spent about 3 months on the bench which was typical back then because the firm was hiring in anticipation of a crush of work that hadn't come yet. And then out of the blue, and what I would later realize was an extraordinary stroke of luck I ended up on an SPAC transaction (this was in 2017 when SPACs were still generally an unheard of IPO route).\n\n**Learning**\n\nOn that first project I had no idea what I was doing as I had never substantively worked on a transaction. I learned a ton about what the terminology, SEC registration/proxy statements, and most importantly got plugged into a partner and senior manager focused on transactions. I would spend the next 2 years with a few holes here and there working with them mainly on IPO's. I personally found the work and process interesting. I used this as an opportunity to ask as many questions as I could so I could understand what was going on and why were doing what we were doing and inadvertently becoming a better technician in transactions not only in accounting but the whole deal in general (e.g. who were the other players and what did they do, what order does everything have to happen in, what hangups are there for the company and how can we help smooth those out if not avoid them altogether, etc).\n\nHaving this experience, as well as actually learning and eventually knowing what it was I was doing, I built a brand for myself as a transactions person. I'll touch more on this, but in general it became known that I had templates other teams could use or people with questions on IPO's/transactions could reach out to me with one off questions, this included people above me.\n\nMy time in AAS was effectively a crash course on SEC reporting, transactions and IPO's. I used it as an informal credential akin to if you could get an MBA in transactions. I learned to draft S-1's/S-4's, write business combination memos, complete purchase price allocation, run an IPO working group (e.g. lawyers, bankers, C-suite, accounting, auditors), and uplift financials/policies. At the time I still didn't know how it would be helpful long term but in the short term I was making myself more valuable to the firm and my teams and it set me up when I became a manager to be in demand at just the right time in 2020 when IPO's exploded. I had teams trying to get any amount of my time to the point that I was brought into some teams as an subject matter resource responsible for just the S-1 pro formas and ability to say no to the parts that were less sexy like unraveling the private company accounting mess.\n\nI say all this not only to give some context but also because there were many people who came in around the same time as myself for similar reasons, basically marking time in public unsure of what their next move is, who treated their experience more as a check the box experience. There's nothing wrong with that but if I had done the same I would have certainly had a different experience and possibly exit ops.\n\n**Service Offerings**\n\nThere are a basically three offerings in AAS - accounting change, transactions, and process improvement. Different firms call them different things but that's basically it.\n\nAccounting change includes helping clients with their adoption of new standards (e.g. ASC 606, ASC 842, and more recently CECL). This is the technical accounting piece where you're reading through the guidance, doing fact finding  to understand the fact pattern (e.g. contract reviews, interviews with accounting/operations/legal), and then writing a policy memo and drafting initial and recurring entries and training the client to do the go forward accounting.\n\nTransactions is fairly straightforward. You're helping clients account for their acquisition and/or IPO, drafting the business combination memo, aligning the accounting to the buyer's policies or to be public company ready and then helping the company post transaction either integrate the target or do their SEC reporting.\n\nProcess improvement is little bit newer and is sometimes dressed up as fancier names such as finance optimization or finance 4.0 but it's all the same. You're basically going into an accounting department that is either crazy inefficient, lacks people, has shown a pattern of misstatements or a mix of all of the above and figuring out how to streamline their accounting so they can close and report timely and accurately. It's a lot of explaining what can sometimes be basic GAAP concepts, updating/creating better templates, and training the accounting staff to do their job better.\n\nI preferred transactions as initially I vaguely understood it was more lucrative if nothing else making you more valuable to the firm on a rate per hour and later on because you learn so much not only about transactions but about getting companies shaped up for bigger and better things with wide access to many different functional areas. Process improvement, if it was the right project, can be interesting but I tried not to get sucked too much into this area. Accounting change I avoided like the plague. Once people know you have experience in an area teams want to pick you up for long spans of time to do one thing and you don't grow a professional. If I spent three years on ASC 842 it would only make me a great accountant for leases and not much else.\n\n**Firm Politics**\n\nBusiness, and especially public accounting, requires some level of politiking. Being in public and lasting for a while requires 2 of 3 things, be very likable, be a great technician, and/or know how to navigate the politics. As a senior the politics don't matter quite as much from a promotion standpoint, unless it's a down year. But being able to navigate the people in a firm can help you to 1) shape the type of experience you have and 2) clarify and or even influence your career potential in the firm. I know a lot of people want to be remote 100% and I get that driving to a client or flying for some is huge turnoff, but you do lose the networking aspect of public in a remote world. This is a tangible benefit both in the firm as long as you stay and outside of the firm once you leave. I don't think 100% in person is what we should/will go back to but some hybrid level, especially for the benefit of younger staff, is important in my opinion.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I connected by chance with people that could bring me into the type of work I wanted to be in. I also worked with a leader in my region's practice who I got along well enough with that they pulled me along later on into other interesting projects and someone who I knew would look out for me in terms of getting above average compensation and keep me on my promotion track when the firm was holding people back because of potential covid impacts they were anticipating. The latter relationship allowed me to push for more opportunities to manage my projects how I wanted and hand pick my projects and staff. While the original encounters were by chance, staying in touch, doing good work, and building a working relationship with them was big for making sure that I continued to progress.\n\nIn terms of types of projects, early on once I had gotten a taste of transactions and knew it was what I wanted to do I made it known that I was looking for transaction and work and communicated, even early on before I truly had significant experience, that I was a transactions person and that's what my specialty was. This allowed me to control my narrative in the practice and generally kept me off of the projects I wanted to avoid. Additionally, I started tracking who worked on transactions and would reach out to them before I became available in order to line up my next project when I started sensing that my current project was wrapping. The few times I ended up on non-transaction work it was because my projects ended abruptly (dead deal) or because there happened to be no openings within my network for my level at the time.\n\n**Work/life balance and Travel**\n\nI started in AAS pre-covid in 2017 when travel was still possible. Working in transactions, it was understood you would be on the road and I was about 60-80% of the time. As a young single person this was great. I got an expense account to charge meals to (and many great meals were charged to the client), I didn't have to do dishes or heavy cleaning, I built status reaching the top tier of the hotel/rental car/airlines I had picked (FYI pick Delta, United is meh and who would voluntarily pick American??), and I got to see some cool places including some international travel (which is rare even for AAS). I usually flew to the client on Sunday/Monday and flew home on Thursdays and worked.\n\nThe hours in AAS depend on the offering you're on. Transactions can be a lot leading up to filings, we're talking usually 80+ in the last 2-3 weeks leading up to an IPO but outside of those last few weeks it's traditionally been close to 45-50 hours with a lot of flexibility once your team trusts you of when you work/taking time off. Overall I would say I worked less total hours than audit. Of course post covid everyone is hurting for people and AAS is no exception so the hours are closer to 50 hours minimum but at some point as the staffing levels adjust things should settle.\n\n**Compensation**\n\nThe compensation is usually about 15%-20% higher than audit with the exception of internal transfers which most firms usually can get away with offering less. I would generally advise against internal transfers from a comp perspective as well as the fact that internal transfers often end up getting pulled into their old service line even after they transition.\n\nKnow your worth, check the comp threads for your area and ask your network what the going rate for your level is. I wish I had negotiated my initial offer into AAS as I think I could have gotten more.\n\n**Exit Ops**\n\nGenerally the exit ops are the same as audit (but quicker path) plus technical roles, lateral moves to FDD/transactions, project based accounting, strong MBA candidate (with a good GMAT of course), and for high performers possibly boutique IB.\n\nAdditionally, the promotion track is the same as audit, generally 2 years at staff, 3 at senior, 3 at manager, and 4+ at senior manager.\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\nOnce travel opens up, for those in AAS it will be important to relearn what the expense policy is. There are certain tricks, which vary firm to firm, when it comes to maximizing your experience. Things like can you use personal hotel cards to book travel vs your corporate card or can you shift your breakfast allowance to cover lunch, or using meal averaging to charge more on the non-travel days and grab something quick from the airport on travel days. Also, sign up for rewards programs with travel companies and stick with one vendor as much as possible.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nAAS, and public in general, is what you make of it. I found it to advance my career in a way that would have been hard to replicate in industry. Certainly there are many ways to be successful and success looks different to different people. But if you're trying to advance your career quickly, public is one of the most accessible and tested ways to do that for accountants and I would go further to say that AAS is an even better accelerant than audit as there's much more critical thinking involved vs compliance check the box activities.\n\nBe good to people, both above and below you, and it will pay dividends. Too many people let small things work them up in the moment when in reality it's not a big deal and certainly not worth torching a connection over. You never know when someone will be in a position to help you.\n\nTry to have your next goal in sight so that you can make decisions, even if small, that steer you towards the next opportunity.\n\n# Epilogue\n\nFor those curious, I left as an M3 for a Senior Manager Technical Accounting and Reporting role at a pre-IPO company. I was basically brought in to help take the company public, do the SEC reporting going forward, help them with uplift of their accounting  and special accounting projects. All things I already do for my clients.\n\nMy bump in base was 45% with a potential for annual bonus of +20% of my old base (a far cry from the 4-6% firms typically give) plus equity (which includes vesting clauses) in the amount of 450% of my old base before tax and after any buy-in cost. Right now if you have at least 3 years of experience the market is very hot. Just be careful to jump not only for money but also for the ability to grow as a professional.",

    "text": "Public Accounting Business Model Every day we see posts in this sub about how toxic and awful the firms people work for are.  Comments like \"It's like they want us to quit!\" are everywhere.\n\nThis post is my attempt to help people understand the business model they chose to participate in.\n\nPeople need to educate themselves about the business dynamics of the industry they are entering. Public accounting is, by nature, a churn and burn business. The way these firms make money is by charging an average \"rate per hour\" (even if a client is a fixed fee, the per hour rate is used to come up with that fee) higher than the actual utilized cost per hour of their employees.\n\nLet's say you are a manager (the last real stop on the chargeable hours game before you are expected to be winning new business) and you make $135k a year. After taxes/benefits, you cost \\~$162k to the firm. For easy math, assume they set a baseline of 2,500 \"available\" working hours in the year (hours they expect you to be online in a year). This is a cost of $65/hr. If you are 50% chargeable across the year then your cost per chargeable hour (aka utilized cost) is $130.\n\nNow for a new staff: $60k salary, \\~$72k cost to firm after taxes/benefits. If we assume they expect 80% utilization, your cost per chargeable hour is $36.\n\nWhat does this tell you? The firm literally makes 3x+ margin on the chargeable hours of a new staff vs a manager. When people are upset about missing out on promotion or there being too few seniors/managers and too many staff, this is the equation driving the entire business model.\n\nThe firm literally cannot make enough to pay the partners their expected take if they don't constantly maintain a workforce mix that keeps their weighted average utilized cost per hour low. **This is why they have all the power.** \n\nThey can \"motivate\" you in any way they want because they DO NOT WANT EVERYONE TO STAY. They need turnover to sustain the model.  If you ever look at a firm's communication or decision and wonder \"why would they do this? It is just driving me and people like me away\" you are right!  They have predetermined a \"healthy\" % of staff that they **WANT** to burn out.  \n\nIf you don't think that as a new/experienced staff or senior that the only thing the firm cares about is how much you contribute to keeping utilized cost per hour low, you are kidding yourself. **It isn't something to be angry about or rebel against, it is literally the foundation of the public accounting industry and what you signed up for, knowingly or not.**\n\nThis is not a doom and gloom post - just the business reality.  Take this knowledge and use it.  Use it to know what you are getting into and frame your mindset accordingly.  Use it to realize that if your dream is to make partner, you are not fighting a war of merit, but a war of attrition.  If you can stay sane through the burnout and are halfway able to sell new PA work/network then you are in good shape to go the distance.  99.9% of new staff reading this will not make partner (again, **BY DESIGN**) and that is OK.\n\n**Soapbox moment:** This subreddit would be better served discussing the implications of this business model and how they affect the practices of public accounting as a \"protector of financial markets.\" Whenever you see stories about B4 getting hit with regulatory fines due to bad audit work, sure as shit was there a meeting where some poor manager/senior manager was being hammered about their average utilized cost on a job. They decided to staff up and put way too risky of work onto unqualified staff to try and hit a KPI for the partners.\n\nShould this change? If we wanted it to, how would this come about?  These are far more interesting topics to discuss instead of lamenting how the PA business model continues to operate as designed.",

    "text": "Friday story time - the worst recruiting experience I’ve had Since I saw a post about recruiters I thought I’d chime in about my worst experience. This happened 5-7 years ago. \n\nI had never worked with a recruiter before but knew they had a lot of in’s with big companies and I wanted that big company experience on my resume. I met a recruiter from a national firm, seemed cool, bought me lunch, pitched me jobs that could be a fit. \n\nWithin a few months I landed a new gig at a Fortune 100 in a massive accounting dept. It was very corporate and I loved it and could have seen myself staying there. \n\n2 years in I get called into the SVP of accountings office. In there is HR and legal. I’m like wtf. \n\nWhat happened was the company was hiring for a senior accounting manager position that was above my boss and they wanted to fill it externally. They put it out to recruiters and the job was never publicly posted nor given to the in house recruiters. \n\nSaid recruiter I worked with two years prior gets it and thinks ‘I placed someone in there, let me submit their resume for the position, maybe they will hire from within and I can get some commission’. So my resume gets thrown into the mix without my knowledge, consent, anything….I had no idea this position was open. \n\nSo there I am looking like an idiot in this boardroom getting grilled by HR and the SVP. My boss gets called in so that person finds out there’s now a position higher than them that they won’t even be considered for. While I’m trying to plead my case of ignorance on the issue IT had taken my laptop cause they think I have hacked into emails or HR databases to get information. I didn’t get it back for two days. I asked that this not be included on my file and they said it was an incident and they couldn’t promise anything. \n\nIn the end the recruiter gets called, admits what happened, and the saga ends. Somehow word gets out about this new position amongst staff (not from me) but makes me look bad. Employees are upset they can’t apply for it and it causes some real issues in the dept.\n\nMy review comes up, my raise was like less than 1%,  a joke, and my boss scolded me for what happened and says it hurt their career as well. \n\nI left a few months later for a pre IPO tech company and never looked back. The recruiter tried contacting me in the future and I told them to politely pound sand. \n\nMoral of the story: trust your recruiter and try to work with boutique firm instead of a national firm. Get to know them. Make sure they aren’t just a sleezy salesperson. \n\nHave a Good Friday!",

    "text": "My path to CFO (of a company with 75 employees) I've been a member of this subreddit since before my accounting career started. It was a highly valuable tool for gaining insight into the industry. The broad access to information that this subreddit facilitates is helping members of the community regain some control over their careers and lives. This community helped me, and now I want to share my story in hopes that it helps someone else here.\n\nAccounting was a career change for me. I came out of undergrad into the worst recession since 1929, and I am still making up ground, recovering from it. People weren't hiring. But I had a friend who went to work drilling for mining operations underground and was making over $100k/yr in the middle of this recession. So, I swallowed some pride and became an underground driller as well. Despite feeling like I had failed by reason of accepting my new lot in life as a driller, I enjoyed that work quite a lot. It was honest, hard work, and I made good money. But, somewhere down the line I got sent to drill in Mexico in a mine that had two owners-- one was on paper, and the other was a faction of the Sinaloa cartel. It was the second time that the cartel, armed with pistols, directed my crew to change the location of our drilling, so they could extract from an area with super-rich ore that I decided it was no longer in my best interest to continue on in this career. Surreptitiously, I boarded the Cessna 182 that taxied miners between the mine and civilization. My foreman was an alcoholic cokehead that I didn't trust not to sabotage my plans to escape. So, I made my way from the mine to the San Ignacio landing strip and hitched a ride from there back to Mazatlan where I booked a room and a flight home the next day. It was that night in the hotel that I jotted down several career alternatives, what it would take in terms of debt and time to get financial parity with my drilling job. I arrived at the conclusion that it would take seven years going down the accounting path. Two years to get my Master's, and five years to get to $100k.\n\nFortunately, I had been a good saver with about $30k in the bank. I lived off savings and financed my tuition while I earned a Master's in accounting from a non-target school. Upon gaining the requisite number of accounting credits, I signed up to begin taking the CPA exams. I took the exams very seriously because I viewed passing as my only shot at credibility due to earning my Master's degree from an awful school. I studied 10-12 hours per day and knocked out the exams in seven weeks, miraculously passing the four sections (not sure how many sections there are now) on the first go-around. This got my foot in the door of a small local CPA firm in a large metro area ($49k/yr). I stayed there for a year, auditing non-profits and small local governmental entities. There was no joy in this. After I'd been there a year, I applied for an experienced auditor position (private industry) with a Top 10 national firm ($54k/yr I think). I got the job. After 1.5 years at the larger firm ($60k) and a promotion to SR, I fought and clawed my way into the financial due diligence group (which my office did not have, and for which I was the first person from my office to join). I spent a year in the FDD group ($62.5k/yr)and loved the work, learning incredibly valuable information about how businesses really work and what creates enterprise value. But, as you saw, the pay was dogshit. Because the MPO was out of touch with the work I was doing, I was unable to get a satisfactory raise ($64.5k/yr at the end) without moving to another city. At this point, I jumped ship to go to industry, in financial services ($80k salary, 15% bonus). This job was not for me. I think there were about 16 accountants in the department, and I felt a mix of me not understanding the business, and boredom. I lasted 6 months. Next, I went to a national consulting firm ($80k/yr salary + $30-40k bonus) where we consulted for attorneys with clients in litigation. Essentially, we were tasked with limiting damages when our attorney's client was being sued, or the opposite when our attorney's client was the one doing the suing. Our firm was a top tier firm, in this particular field, so our rates started around $300/hr for associates up to $800/hr for Managing Directors. I lasted about 6 months. My supervisor, for whatever reason, did not like me. It was a new line of work for me, I didn't know what I was doing, and I got talked to because when they reviewed my work, there were mistakes. At this firm, mistakes were not well-tolerated. I accept that I may not have been up to the task for this work. I also know that I would have been very good at the job if training were anything like public accounting. At any rate, I left without having the next job lined up, for the first time in my career.\n\nAt this point, the pandemic was just starting. I spent several months looking at businesses for sale, brainstorming ideas on how to start my own small business. But by mid-March, it appeared we were shutting down the economy and the stock market was taking a nosedive. Like so many others, I started trading stocks and was making money quickly. The housing market was heating up and nobody understood why at the time. I sold my house because it looked like an opportunity to make a little money before the economy collapsed. By late August, it appeared the housing market was going to continue heating up, so I used the money from the sale of my house to buy some land in my small hometown with the intent of developing it into residential building lots. This was a convergence of luck, opportunity and necessity. There were very few building lots available in my hometown, and at the beginning, there were no developers planning on creating new lots. I got a great deal on the land I bought. By May of 2021, all of the subdivision improvements had been made and the city signed off on the project allowing me to sell the lots. I have one buyer who has taken down 11 lots so far, and my debt is being paid down quickly on the project. The first phase of the development looks like it will be sold out by the end of this year, and this project is looking like it's going to be a homerun.\n\nAfter completing the improvements to the subdivision, I took a mini-vacation. On this vacation, I decided I wanted to start a small accounting consulting business to both fill-up my time, and to help with income when developing inevitably slows down and we come into the off-cycle for housing starts. I reached out to my banker to ask that he keep me in mind should any of his clients (heavy construction) mention needing a bookkeeper or consultant. I got a response that he knew someone that I should meet with. We set up a lunch meeting for the next week. The banker showed up first, me second. While waiting for the prospective client to arrive, the banker tells me he thinks they're actually looking for a CFO. I tell him that's probably out of reach for me, and I'm probably a good five years of accounting experience away from being a strong candidate. The banker tells me to hear out the client anyway. So the client arrives, tells me about the business, tells me he needs a CFO. I let him know I took the meeting under a different assumption and did my best to be honest about not having the skills/experience a CFO should have. This apparently enticed him even more. We met for beers, had multiple late night phone calls just talking about business and life. Each time we'd talk, he'd ask \"what do you think?\". I'd tell him it was very appealing, but that I had reservations about my ability to provide the value he needed. Eventually, that turned into me telling him that if he believed I could do it, I'd take the chance ($120k/yr + 30% bonus). I've been the CFO nearly three months now and I absolutely love it. Also, I'm being groomed to become the COO in another 1-2 years.\n\nWhy did they hire me to be CFO? I think it's pretty clear that in less populated areas, the skills and experience that I have are almost non-existent. I benefited tremendously going to a rural market with skills you only learn in metro areas. Shallow talent pools in LCOL areas may be your key to a better career.\n\nI may check back to respond to questions/comments, or I may not. I just wanted to share this story and add to the knowledge base here in this community. I hope you found it to be of some benefit.",

    "text": "Students! Interested in exploring a Federal career? The GAO is hiring interns for Summer 2022. Details + AMA inside. The U.S. Government Accountability Office is the supreme audit institution of the U.S. We audit the annual financial statements of agencies such as the IRS, SEC, FDIC, and CFPB, with lots of DoD work mixed in as well to name a few. \n\nI've been an auditor with the GAO for a few years and a reader of this sub since college. Here is my candid take on the agency, feel free to AMA as well.\n\nThe PROs:\n\n1) Work life balance is incredible. 40 hour weeks. Telework 4 days/week (before Covid). Flexible work schedules. Overtime (very rare) is paid at 1.5x or you get an hour of PTO for every OT hour you work - your choice. etc. etc.\n\n2) Solid salary. For DC, the current *minimum* fulltime starting salary is $69,977. New hires who meet performance expectations will get an approximately 7% raise every 6 months for the first two years. That will put you at ~$92k after two years of work. The Senior I salary minimum for DC is ~$97k and the Senior II salary minimum for DC is ~$108k. Assistant Director (think Manager/S. Manager) minimum is ~$137k.\n\n3) Variety of work. You can choose if you want to work on Financial Statement audits, Performance audits, or do Standards work (updating audit guidelines). There are many choices of engagement under each category and the agency makes it a priority to assign people to their preference whenever possible.\n\n4) We're actually proud of the work that we do. We play a big role in efforts to improve federal financial management and reducing fraud, waste, and abuse. Our performance audits last year resulted in about $77 Billion saved in federal spending.\n\n5) Job stability. Accounting is a stable career. Government is a stable employer. When you combine the two you get one of the most stable job opportunities possible. I have no concerns about my job counting to exist, even in a 2008 style downturn.\n\n6) Government benefits. The TSP is considered one of the best 401(k) plans due to its minuscule fees and good fund options. Lots of healthcare plans to choose from. etc.\n\nThe CONs:\n\n1) If you want to be a B4 partner this is not the career for you. Not that we haven't had people leave to take high up positions in public accounting, this just isn't the way to fast track that.\n\n2) Slower career advancement. You almost certainly won't make senior in 2 years like you would in public accounting. You'll probably be making more $ than that senior for not-insane job responsibilities though so ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯. 3-6 years is a more common promotion schedule to Senior I here.\n\n3) Lower salary cap. People 15 years into their career here are making around $120-130k. Could you be making more in public or going public and then jumping to industry? Absolutely. I personally don't think the trade-off is worth it when you consider how many long nights and weekends it takes to get there. It's a personal choice though. If you want to make the most money possible this isn't the career for you. $120k mid-career for 40 hours/week is enough for me though.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything. I'll to try respond throughout the day. Throwaway account because I don't want my usual account tied to my agency.\n\nIntern postings:\n\nUndergrad: https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/613130900\n\nGraduate: https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/613130700",

    "text": "So you want an internship through Meet the Firms? BITCH, I got you! \n\nLast spring I attended Meet the Firms and got 0 interviews. A semester later during the fall I got 6 interviews and 3 offers [probably would’ve gotten 4 (but I was late to one of them)]. \n\nRight now you’re probably taking a shit or on reddit while attending your zoom classes, and worrying about the upcoming meet the firms and how you don’t have an internship. \n\nPrerequisite 1: Chillax, ma. It’s not that scary.\nPrerequisite 2: You’re going to need a GOOD LOOKING resume. You don’t need prior accounting working experience because they know you don’t have any, at least for audit anyways. Please get it reviewed by someone that acquired an internship already at the very least. Firms want to know that you did something else besides school and were not a bum. I was working at Taco Bell as assistant to the manager while going to school.\n\nThe plan: Choose your desired firms. Of course I chose all the Big 4s because I was drowning in Kool-Aid (still am). Also picked mid tiers and regionals. Since it’s online, you can schedule 10 minute meetings with professionals. I filled up my schedule back to back with professionals, everybody from associates to partners, 2pm-6pm. \n*PRO TIP* If you are a minority WITHIN the accounting field, try to pick a professional that has the same ethnic background as you. We live in America, and accounting is not immune to racial tribalism. A guy I picked was the same race as me and we kicked it off right off the bat. Deadass played the race card on him.\n\nNow you filled your schedule with 15+ people.\n\nBefore MTF: Grab a pen and pencil and make a list of everyone you’re meeting with. You will need this for contact information and notes about your conversation. God bless this is online because it’s way easier than in person. \n*Important* take a shot or two. This is going to loosen you up and actually make you have a good time during this event. Not even joking, this is what I did.\n\nDuring MTF:\n\nThe conversation and questions to ask:\n\nWhen you meet up with them ask how they are doing, when it’s near the end you can be like “long day, huh?” \n\nAsk how’d you get into accounting, then tell them your story of your journey into accounting. I told them how I was an “entrepreneur” 😳\n\nAsk them why’d you chose audit over tax? What made them choose x firm over y firm/industry? What are your long term goals at x firm? Some generic shit to keep the conversation flowing. \n\n If you still have time, my go to question was “any tips and tricks for a college student like me?” This question will wake them up and make you more memorable.\n\nAt the end, ask them for their email and if you can add them on linkedin. After meeting with them write down your notes of the conversation you had with the person. \n\nAt the end of the day send a thank you note with something going back to your conversation for everyone you connected with, they probably won’t reply, but that’s an extra point right there. Finally, wait for the interviews to come pouring in!\n\nMy results: \nInterviews - 2 Big 4, 3 mid tiers, 1 regional\nOffers - 1 Big 4, 2 mid tiers (would’ve gotten the 3rd if I carefully looked at my email)\n\nRight now I’m interning with a Big 4 and don’t know what the fuck I’m doing and why.\n\nMods, sticky this for all accounting students during quarantine.",

    "text": "New job, just looked at the books. *Yikes.* Stay or go? **Background:**\n\nMe, late thirties professional, changing careers from humanities/operations into accounting (I was covid-laid-off last spring from a job I was trying to quit anyway). I have lots of inventory management and spreadsheet reporting experience but very little formal accounting experience. I'm signed up for a university accounting certificate program this summer, taking community college prerequisites now, and am tentatively planning to take the state CPA exams before 2025 if I decide the additional required economics/business classes are worth it.\n\nI also just started a job as an operations/finance manager at a local company in the same field as my previous jobs, and I was super excited for it as a bridge job to apply my increasing accounting knowledge to. Also negotiated a killer title and a profit-sharing arrangement based on increasing net income. The owner is kind of a curmudgeonly dick with a reputation for being a penny pincher, but the interviews were great and part of my professional expertise is being an intermediary in situations like this. I'd also already been warned that he and his ex-wife, who are both principles in the business, have some sort of divorce arrangement in which he draws an unusually large salary and gives her half, and also she draws a salary for doing literally nothing. Fine, whatever, that was up front: his company, his rules, okay. First week on the job was great, getting into office systems and coming on board and meeting the staff.\n\nThen today the bookkeeper showed me around quickbooks, and... holy shit. The owner just expenses whatever he wants, and the operations side of the business that I signed on for is all mixed up with the sales side of the business that I did *not* sign on for. I thought they were separate companies, and they are very much not.\n\nPlus, the bookkeeper was pointing out some of the problems that I've been tasked to fix (like getting operations staff to actually submit expense reports), so she pulls up the latest credit card statement and just starts pointing at things, explaining that the owner just expenses anything he feels like. As in the company credit card is a costco business visa, and apparently a lot of his personal groceries go on there, ANY gas for his car or his son's car (who's also an employee), personal prescriptions under the guise of being \"part of the health plan\" (the bookkeeper literally pointed to a transaction and said \"that's the viagra\"), cases of wine ostensibly to dine potential buyers with but is mostly for personal consumption... like, really bad.\n\nI asked how much of this was senility and how much of this was tax evasion, and the bookkeeper said \"yes,\" which on top of a heated discussion I witnessed last week about rather than giving performance bonuses in cash he's going to give them in gift cards so that they can be \"expensed,\" well.... Plus apparently the salary he's drawing is WAY over local market rate and the contracted CPA has warned him that he's at high audit risk and he's said he'll just sue them (I don't even know if that's a thing?), so he's playing audit chicken and that's a game he'll eventually lose.\n\nPlus, my profit-sharing bonuses are based on increasing net income, which I took to mean net income of the operations side, but since it's all the same business and all the same quickbooks file, it's probably net income of the entire company, which in 2019 (the year my bonus is to be calculated as an increase from) was -$260,000. What. So I'm pretty sure that it was a bait-and-switch, I just don't know how much of it was senility and how much of it was deliberately misleading. He wouldn't let me see the financial figures until I'd signed an offer letter, and I don't think I would have signed an offer letter if I'd seen the financial figures.\n\n**Question:**\n\nDo I need to quit, like, NOW, overnight, to avoid any association with this dumpster fire that may impact me becoming a CPA? Like, is there professional liability for me if I'm involved with this? If he gets audited will my title including the word \"finance\" drag me into this? The stated intent was for me to \"take over\" some of the financial tasks, which I now realize would make me complicit in some level of tax evasion, but I'm not sure how immediate an issue that is.\n\nBasically, is this a \"send an email and leave the keys on the desk and never go back\" kind of situation? Or is this a take a graceful exit at the end of the month (it wasn't the right fit, I got another opportunity, etc)? My gut says GTFO, but I don't have enough information to tell if that's the right call.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo make it clear, this isn't a dream job. I've burned out of three dream jobs and don't need another one. This is something that was a good opportunity before I saw what went in the sausage and now I'm no longer hungry. I'm just looking for advice on how fast I need to run. I also am not financially dependent on this position, since my spouse works and I'm getting covid unemployment benefits, so I can walk out the door tomorrow without hesitation if that's prudent.",

From what I’ve gathered we’re very understaffed with seniors and managers, but we’re not in too bad of shape with associates. I had a slow start with my clients and my utilization was crazy low. I know HR reached out to my mentor a couple of times about this when I first began. Throughout busy season I was only ever in the middle of rankings for utilization, but since then I’ve completely tanked back down to crazy low. My reviews were all at meets level and I reach out all the time for work, but I’m super paranoid I’m about to get the boot? All the other associates seem super busy with higher utilization’s by at least 20%. No one’s really ever given me negative feedback and I’m pretty social with everyone, could it literally just be I have a weird client mix?",

I know many might not consider this a serious issue, and I do not wish to make light of this issue but I'm in need of help due to a couple of hurtful comments made by my coworker with regards to race.\n\nI'm afraid of getting into the details of the situation here but I\"m facing issues because 1) I'm a male and the system is absent from helping us with whatever mental health problems we have 2) I'm a minority - while the system has gotten better to help minorities in general, I have an ethnic name and I feel that if I make a complaint to HR, I could get fired.  It's very hard for me to find a job with my ethnic name.\n\nI'm just briefly going to say that a female coworker made a couple of comments about a certain race that I visibly resemble that has a negative stereotype in society.  Those comments were negative.  I spoke to the manager about this and she brought us together over a zoom call where the coworker apologized.  That coworker has now been promoted to supervisor.\n\nThere are times where I just cannot focus on my job due to her comments.  I have had thoughts about quitting my job or thoughts about suicide because I didn't feel like my career was progressing.  I'm hurt and I'm depressed, but I try to be as friendly, pleasant and happy as I can be to ensure that the signs of depression are not visibly seen.\n\nI don't know where to go from here without being put on the spotlight to get fired by HR.

I used to think it was just an office thing, but since we're WFH this year, I'm starting to think it's just busy season in general.\n\nI get watery eyes and a stuffy nose that just won't seem to stop. It's embarassing to the point where I have to go hide in a bathroom stall until it stops.

    "text": "How do you all manage yourself / your work in consulting? Throughout my time in consulting I've found it hard to find a good way to manage my daily/weekly work. I never really found a good system and somewhat regret not spending more time figuring out a good way to manage all the things you need to do on the job (be it emails, actual work, chasing clients/other consultants etc.). As soon as a project gets a bit more complicated with more moving parts & people involved I find it hard to keep track of everything and inevitably feel overwhelmed. It doesn't help when you throw travel & extra 10% work like recruiting and such into the mix.\n\nI'm curious if anyone has come up with systems or tools to manage their work that they're happy with and that has scaled as the responsibilities change through promotion? E.g. I'm super curious how managers / partners manage all the things they need to do and if they've found a good approach.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\nThings I've tried (if you care):\n\n* Pen & notebook:\n   * A good default, but as soon as there are more things to track than a single workstream and a couple of clients over several weeks, you end up re-writing a lot of stuff over and over and likely forgetting things.\n   * It's also easy to forget to check previous days and you don't really get any reminders for things like deadlines or key meetings.\n* Putting everything on the calendar, incl. todos\n   * Just end up with a really messy calendar and as soon as anything changes (which is basically all the time) you need to go in and adjust the calendar for several days because of knock-on effects\n* Excel lists of todos, contacts & who to chase:\n   * Comprehensive but cumbersome to edit (e.g. moving things around, changing priority). A spreadsheet isn't really a todo tool.\n   * To be fair it has been useful on projects with a lot of clients, but still feels very messy to edit and you end up spending a lot of time just managing the excel rather than doing actual work\n* Pretty much every todo app in existence (Wunderlist, Evernote, OneNote, Asana you name it)\n   * Most of the time these tools have a specific schedule or user in mind and I never found a tool that suited my purposes.\n   * I also end up spending more time on messing with the tool than on work\n   * Also occasionally questionable whether you can use these tools because they likely don't meet confidentiality & security requirements.\n* A plain text file in an editor with a few simple rules following some of the ideas in [https://plaintext-productivity.net/](https://plaintext-productivity.net/)\n   * Easy to edit, remove, delete, move around items (e.g. todos or who to chase for things) as I'm very proficient with Vim-commands in my editor of choice (VSCode)\n   * Anyone I need to chase I tag a line with \"@Someone\" so I know who to go after.\n   * When I'm done, I just delete\n   * This is what I've settled on and it's been OK to manage myself at Associate level. I'm not happy that I don't really see any record of what I've done (because I just delete lines over time) and worried this won't scale as I progress and have more complex projects (and especially others) to manage.",

Working for a Cloud or other Vendor:\n   1. Pros: Always a new technology to learn (I really enjoy this part), different clients to keep it interesting, more decent pay ($200 to 230k), potential to move up within the organisation (I find this more exciting prospect to be an exec in Big Tech vs. a operational exec in a corporate)\n   2. Cons: It's an unknown for me to work for a Vendor, potentially zero progression if I do, potential without the ability to go back into consulting.\n2. Corporate:\n   1. Pros: Consistent hours, semi-decent pay (\\~$180k to $200k), nice colleagues (obs depends on corporate)\n   2. Cons: Generally behind on the tech curve, slow pace, and you're always a back office, operational function rather than a front office function, slow progression\n3. Contract roles: This is basically posh \"temping\"\n   1. Pros: Proper 9-5pm, low stress, high pay ($200k to $250k).\n   2. Cons: Zero progression, frustrating projects\n4.

What can I do to change team culture and make this a rewarding experience? 10+ years of experience, 8 years in big 4 tech/management consulting.  I joined an industry position recently as an individual contributor. The role/team was pitched to me as \"small group of internal consultants\" who work with the R&D technical experts to launch new initiatives.  It sounded great on paper.\n\nI've only been here a short time but it's already evident to me that this group doesn't have the respect or leadership to live up to its mission.\n\n1. Talent recruitment is inconsistent.  The hiring manager recently brought on two new members: me (ex-consulting, prior strategy projects), and another girl (purely project management experience).   The team is a mix of very capable ex-consultants and project managers who have been at the company forever.\n2. Comp was good but non-negotiable (should have been a red flag that they weren't going to go the extra mile for stand-out talent)\n3. The team recently got passed over for a serious piece of top-level strategy work, with leadership opting to hire external consultants instead.\n4. My manager has 20+ years at the company but is only a few years into this position, with no prior experience in consulting or strategy & operations work.  In fact, his past experience was purely in project management.  Even now, as a director leading our group he's doing administrative tasks like taking meeting minutes at the leadership meetings.\n5. He is very hands-off on our projects. Doesn't have any targets/metrics for us. He might ask how we're doing but otherwise has no opinions on how well or quickly the work is delivered.  I asked him recently about setting some OKRs /KPIs for the group and he said he would \"do some homework\" (read: google it) and come back next week to talk about it.\n6. The more capable team members leave after 1-2 years, they get \"bored out\" instead of burned out by the job.  On the flip side, work is very very chill, with low expectations, but low potential to grow (personally, professional, or in comp)\n\nIt's clear to me that my manager just doesn't know what \"good\" looks like.  As our effective \"managing director\" he should be out there finding high-visibility work, talking about the team to leadership and selling our capabilities, should have enough of a strategy mindset himself to be able to uphold a standard of quality in his team's outputs.\n\nI just started at the company and feel like I need to put in a good year before I leave. In the meantime, I have a soft spot for tackling organizational challenges and I'd like to help turn this team into the consulting team it was promised to be.  What are some moves I can make this year to effect change?  Is it worth trying to educate my manager to step up to his role?\n\nTL;DR - internal consulting team led by someone who doesn't know consulting.

    "text": "The reaction to Meghan Markle has been....interesting. (Unpopular opinion?) The reactions of black women to this whole Meghan Markle ordeal on this subreddit and Twitter, and on News media have been fairly interesting to me. Would be interested to hear the perspectives of other black women as my opinion might be unpopular going by the views expressed on this subreddit. Personally, whilst I sympathize with Meghan for the racism and blatant discrimination she has faced, I find myself feeling sort of consciously detached to her plight. As a woman of African/Caribbean descent, I find it difficult to wrap my head around as to why any woman of recent African ancestry, or any black woman, would want to marry or be otherwise intricately involved in an institution as racist and colonialist as the British Royal Family. Colonial England, and the BRF, are almost single-handedly responsible for the decimation of African regions and Caribbean countries, which are now part of the Commonwealth and hindered in many ways by this. These people’s ancestors have the blood of her mother’s lineage on their hands. \n\nWhilst I think Meghan is an intelligent woman, I do believe that she was being disingenuous when she relayed her supposed limited knowledge of the royal family, and I believe some of her claims have been disputed by her own friends. Operating under the assumption that what she said is true however, I don’t understand why she didn’t do more research into their colonial heritage and history. The British monarchy, including Harry himself,  are very racist and are symbolical remnants of white supremacy. Price Harry is the man who wore a nazi costume and allegedly denigrated his fellow army-men of color. I find this to be hypocritical and I don’t buy his reasoning that he wasn’t aware of the depths of racial discrimination before meeting Meghan given his family’s history.\n\nI walked away from the interview feeling sorry for Meghan, but feeling that she was very naive and thought that her being biracial/white-passing would somehow aid her. Had Meghan been a fully black, unambiguous black woman of a darker complexion, I seriously think she would not have even been allowed to marry him.\n\nI also take issue with people on here referring to Meghan as black, when she has repeatedly stated that she is biracial, and her experience reflects that of her phenotypically mixed heritage and not that of mono-racial black women. Before I knew of her background, I actually thought she was white. Even Harry thought she was only white when he met her. I’m trying to be open-minded on this point, because I realize that America has a different racial classification system than the rest of the world. I don’t want to be accused of “policing blackness” (although I find it weird that all races but black people can exercise some sort of racial exclusivity) but I do find it slightly bewildering as Meghan, who is ambiguous and white-passing, would be categorized as exactly what she is-mixed/biracial- anywhere else in the world, especially in Africa and the Caribbean. I also take larger particular issue with this as I find that what constitutes a black woman these days are blurred, but not so for our male counterparts. Everyone seems to agree on what a black man can look like, and they are thus aptly represented in the media, but there is a curious leeway for black woken in the media, and I’m starting to see more biracial instead of monoracial media representation for black women and I feel like claiming Meghan as black plays into this. \n\nThis idea that Meghan was going to modernize the BRF is delusional to me and this is exactly the outcome that I expected. Why any black or biracial woman would need to modernize this institution in the first place or add “a splash of melanin” or whatever ridiculous phrase some people are using is lost on me. Why would we need to modernize an institution that oppressed our ancestors? I was surprised that she and Harry stated that after everything, they were still open to working for the Queen and Meghan “representing the commonwealth” (what even...?).\n\nAlso, I find black women claiming Archie is “black” astounding tbh. I hope this is a minority opinion because it makes zero biological sense and is very embarrassing . I have also noticed some BW living vicariously through her, and this has me slightly worried. The majority of women defending Meghan look nothing like her and the people fetishizing this relationship (especially because it may be/is considered interracial) need to stop.\n\nI hope I wasn’t too harsh with my commentary and would be willing to her criticisms/thoughts.\n\nAddition: (unrelated) We may take issue with some things black men do as a collective but some of the black women on Twitter (I see you Monique Pressly) accusing black men of not being supportive enough of Meghan/being the most disrespectful towards her is ridiculous to me.

    "text": "How Black Men Are Discussed on This Subreddit Is Toxic af I am not trying to dismiss what people have experienced. Me myself many times have been put down by black guys which was racist, colorists, or sexist things. It is an experience being both black and a woman and there is intersectionality ignored by feminism, by media, by the LGBT community, and even BLM.\n\nThe thing is I’m confused a lot of the time people dogpile on black men on this subreddit for things when I have experienced much of the same from black women. Are you really telling me colorism, racism, misogyny, and homophobia is one sidely expressed by black men? \n\nI don’t understand about how black men are colorist where Black women can’t be, some of the first colorist things I heard were from my aunt and other black girls. One of my biracial best friends mother told her not to date black men because she does not want nappy headed grandchildren. This is from a dark-skinned black womenI have heard many black girls say they want mixed race kids or someone non-black. But nooo this is just black men right? And not only that it’s weird how Black women in interracial relationships is either promoted on r/Blackladies or side eyed but black men doing are always self-hating and colorist. And their kids aren’t black, relate to black people, they’re mixed not black, that sentiment is not isolating at all to mixed race black people.\n\nWith black men treating black women badly in professional spaces or predominantly white spaces I won’t deny any experiences . There are definitely Black people that purposefully avoid and demean black peoples to gain acceptance in these environments. The thing is are we really going to generalize and say all black men are like this? I have definitely experience reaching out to Black women at professional spaces and being treated rudely in return, but I know not to generalize. Many times it has been easier to befriend women of other races before someone black but ultimately black people are just people to have the chance to be anything, race doesn’t guarantee a friendship from that person or respect.\n\nIt’s so hateful and negative that I feel like unsubbing. It’s weird how a lot of the times people posting about their negative experiences never account for how they chose their relationships or how they come off. A lot of the time they could aloof and uninterested , self-pitying, condescending, and never take responsibility.\n\nIt’s weird how a lot of the people comment that they hate when people generalize black women into stereotypes and we are the most educated and this...but it’s completely okay to avoid black men and stereotype them.

    "text": "Falsely accused of stealing while at work Hello guys (TLDR at the bottom) . I'm in need of advice! I'm in a very tough situation. On Saturday I was falsely accused of stealing while working. I work at a retail store that sells clothes, makeup accessories etc. I've been working at this specific location for 4 months but worked for this company for 3 years as a whole. While I was working I was called over by one of my managers. She told me Alice  (another manager) and her wanted to have a word with me. I also want to note that Alice seemed very mad at me and I had noticed her watching me during that shift that day. (Both managers are asian) \n\nThey told me to follow them and took me to a private room. I had no idea what they pulled me over for. They both stood there in front of me and Sharon the one that called me over told me to empty out my pockets. I was a bit shocked. I followed as was said and emptied out my pockets. I showed them that my front and back pockets pockets were empty apart from the NYX lipstick I had in my pocket (one I was wearing that day) . They both seemed a bit surprised. They seemed to of expected for me to of stolen a lipstick from their company. (Which btw is literally sold for £1 so why would I bother stealing their low quality makeup? I don't own a single makeup product from the company I work at) . \n\nSharon then said \"Oh! Well Alice said she saw you put something from the makeup department into your pocket while doing the returns (putting clothes/ items back onto the shop floor) . Alice seemed extremely embarrassed I see her turning red. She was very quiet the whole time. I feel like if you have the guts to make such a big accusation you should have the guts to be the one saying it!\n\nSharon then had the audacity to ask me \"Do you know where to put the items when doing returns?\" \"Yes, I put them back onto the shop floor...\" such a dumb question asking as if the n*gga chip inside of me would suddenly activate and cause for me to steal. I've been returning clothes onto the shop floor for months with no issues for months!\n\nWhat really grinded my gears was that Sharon ended things saying \"Well, next time just make sure to not put that in your pocket incase it causes another misunderstanding\" . Basically making it seem like I caused this \"misunderstanding\" and projecting the blame onto me instead admitting THEY were in the wrong. When they falsely accused me! I just ended things saying that I've gotta go to my break.\n\nThis situation has left me feeling so upset and angry. Everytime I as a black person walk into a store I worry about people thinking I'm going to steal. I worry about the most innocent actions I make may be perceived as being suspicious. I worry about potentionally being falsely accused of stealing and that's EXACTLY what happened today. I never thought that I'd have to worry about this at a place I worked at. \n\nI talked to 5 other people and they quickly said racism and felt like race played a part in this accusation. I talked to 4 other black people and 1 Asian guy. I just don't know what to do. I feel saddened especially since I wasn't even given the benefit of the doubt. There is literally nothing about me, my character, my work ethic, the way I dress that would've ever indicated that I was the type of person to steal. Nothing apart from the fact that I'm black. I can't help but wonder what if it was a white coworker doing the same thing? Would anyone's mind quickly jump to stealing? Or would it of just been brushed aside and given the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI know some people will say this has nothing to do with race but black people are constantly being falsely accused of stealing! We're more likely to be falsely accused of stealing something that turned out to be our own belongings. What do you guys think? Do you think race potentionally played a part in influencing this assumption? I know that people have unconscious racial biases/stereotypes ingrained in them that influences how they see black people that they may not be consciously aware of.\n\nI saw Alice on the shop floor afterwards and she has not said a word to me since. Sharon tried to awkwardly sweep things under the rug by doing her job and giving me orders to do as normal. Neither have apologised.\n\nWhat would you do if you were in my position? Would you quit or keep going to work and move on? I already hated this job before this situation happened. They overwork us, always understaffed and the pay is only minimum wage. The only thing that I like about the job are the people I work with. I enjoy talking to them while I'm there. However this situation has left me in tears for days and feeling very uncomfortable.\n\nTLDR; Got accused of stealing at work by 2 Asian female managers at work. Called me me to empty out my pockets only to find out they were wrong and have since not apologised and have attempted to sweep things under the rug by acting normal and projecting the blame onto me.",

How do you think colorism/texturism/featurism has impacted the way lighter and darker skinned black women have been portrayed in the media?\n\nOn the bachelor contestants, Taylor Nolan's recent Instagram live, her and Pieper touched on colorism and the mixed race experience. Pieper talked about how being a lighter skinned black woman, racism affects her differently. She talked about how there are nuanced and different levels of racism.\n\nTaylor says she and other light black women (like Pieper) have been portrayed as angry black women. She also talks about how her and other light skinned black people were light enough to get onto the show and be the token black person.\n\nIn my own experience, as a mixed black woman, I think colorism can sometimes allow me to get my foot in the door in white spaces like jobs but I am still watched suspiciously because they assume I will do black stereotypes because of racism (like steal, get angry, be late, be uncivilized and abuse/attack). I remember growing up in the white conservative suburbs and feeling ignored and not considered for dating by white and poc/black boys because I was not white and having a lot of trauma from that. I remember a racist white nurse dismissing my pain and assuming I went in her office to skip class. I remember some white teachers treating me poorly, assuming I had an attitude and not giving me the benefit of the doubt. As a woman, I avoid being in all white spaces... But when I have been, now I have to worry about being hyper sexualized by white men. In liberal white spaces, I worry about being fetishized. When I call a white person out for racism, ask for my needs, am quiet or angry, I am seen as a threat and Intimidating by white people because I am challenging the status quo and not appeasing them. So I definitely have experienced the angry black woman stereotype projected onto me. I also know being a lighter mixed black women other stereotypes may be projected at me such as being seductive, sexual, soft, attractive, intelligent, etc. But that isn't always the case. Sometimes I'm thrown the black stereotypes and other times the mixed race stereotypes, often both.. that's why the experiences overlap for me and I call myself a black mixed woman.\n\n\nHow do you think colorism/texturism/featurism has impacted the way lighter and darker skinned black women have been portrayed in the white media/shows? Do you see any differences in portrayal? Do you think mixed/lighter skinned black women are often portrayed as angry?",

    "text": "\"I'm a mixed girl. I just want to be normal.\" If you haven't noticed it, there's a post up on /r/offmychest right now that's gaining quite a bit of karma with the same title. This isn't word play or satire, it's quite literal. Apparently, she really is a \"mixed girl\" who simply wants to be perceived as \"normal\".\n\nOk, I'll admit. I rolled my eyes. I read the title and I immediately rolled my eyes. Even though I'm mother of mixed race children and come from a mixed lineage myself I rolled my eyes.\n\nBut then I took off the Petty Crown, scolded myself for being judgemental, opened the link and got to reading. \n\nI heard her out. I thought about how I would feel if one of my kids were upset because they felt \"abnormal\" and I heard her out. And now I'm struggling, desperately to RESPECTFULLY pen my reaction. I'm not sure if I'm going to succeed, but here goes. \n\nI'll start with a few points I've gathered from her post:\n\n1. \"Normal\" is White. Or at the very least, not Black.\n\n2. She believes cultural appropriation is a myth. \n\n3. The feeling of \"normalcy\" she apparently craves reads much more like \"acceptance from 6f people who don't see color and have lots of \"ethnic\" (abnormal) friends. \n\n4. She is completely removed from her Black side of her family and has no contact with them. I'm not sure if her Black parent abandoned her but she's expressed that she has no ties to them and therefore is frustrated at the fact that she (at times) is percieved as a part of their ethnic group. \n\n5. She seems to have a disdain for African American culture in general. \n\n6. She believes her perceived Blackness is negatively affecting her artwork and how it is recieved. \n\nThere is so much more, I'm just already exhausted with this list.\n\nAt the beginning of her dissertation she recalls an incident where a guy accuses her of \"Looking like the type of person that would accuse someone of appropriation for copying her rat's nest of a hairstyle\". Her disdain isn't aimed at the guy that called her hair a \"rat's nest\". Nor is it aimed at the way he trivialized cultural appropriation (She doesn't belive it exists, remember?) Her disdain apparently stems from being grouped with... us. The audacity. \n\nShe goes on to explain how tired she is of being made to feel that she should have to identify as one of us and research our culture. \n\nIn her own exact words:\n\n\"I am not my race. I am tired of being boiled down to my race by others. I hate having personality traits assigned to my perceived ethnicity.\n\nI wish I was normal and my ethnicity wasn’t a freaking talking point and a major part of my being. It sucks, honestly.\n\nI hate how some people assume I’m some sort of pity seeking, race-baiting asshole because of how I look. I’m just a person, with my own personality. I’m not a statistic.\"\n\n\nHave you ever read something so audacious and absurd that you just placed your phone down and blinked silently at the cosmos?  \n\nHow does one begin to unpack this level of self hatred and dissonance?\n\nIf this sentiment was ever expressed by my own kid I would feel like a complete failure as a mother. I'm talking cry in the shower, 'how could I have let this happen to my baby' type of failure. \n\nI don't really see a point in dissecting this any further or even criticizing her mentality because I don't see that making a difference. Instead, I'd rather make this post a  cautionary tale; to biracial people and parents of biracial children who are half Black. \n\nDon't. Be. This. Guy. \n\nI implore you, if you feel even a smidgen of this sentiment, talk to someone. Talk to your Black parent or a trusted Black relative. Talk to somone educated on Black issues. Talk to someone here. Hell, talk to me if you have no one else... I'll listen. But for the love of cocoa butter, do not DO NOT let yourself sink into the sunken place by relying on mainstream reddit to comfort you in your time of ~~ashiness~~ need.\n\nDammit. I tried.",

    "text": "Making Black Female Friends Has anyone else had trouble/issues making Black female friends as a Black woman? \n\nI really didn't have as much of a hard time with it until late high school, despite growing up in yt areas. I've been used to being the only Black person or one of the few Black people in my majority yt school. When I would try to befriend the other Black kids in my AP classes, who I'm thinking are probably going through the same things I am, they *hated* me and bullied me for allegedly thinking I was \"better\" than them, being \"uppity\" or that I was \"trying to be white\" because of how I spoke. One girl actually tried to pull my hair once. Another girl I almost got into a fight with because I was tired of how she treated me. I ended up having more yt friends and best friends as they seemed to be more welcoming of me, but of course, there's still that level of distance and danger that's there because they don't fully understand your experiences and many of them came from ultra conservative households-- so I was hyper aware that I was the \"Black exception\" friend instead of \"Sally's friend.\"\n\nI have found even in the workplace it's not that much better-- the only Black (female) supervisors I've had made my life hell because I wasn't from the same side of town as them and made low key hateful comments about my interests or the clothes I wore (a mix of things from Target, LOFT or some J. Crew, but just general professional attire) or a bag I wore. They would play games with me and mess with my time off pay to force me to either work during the time I requested off or make me go unpaid because I \"could afford it\" when they didn't know my budget or finances. They'd block me from mentorships and opportunities within the company but also hated that the (largely mediocre and unimpressive) yt coworkers were friendly with me. It's not like these women weren't educated or accomplished; they were in middle management positions and they went to school. So I chalked it up to nasty crabs in a bucket mentality and left. \n\nA lot of these behaviors seems to translate in social situations too-- there's the lowkey comments about me being \"rich\" or being a \"valley girl\" or about the way I dress or what I wear and how I speak. (Pre pandemic) I would go to women's meetups and hangouts and would open myself up to talking to the Black ladies there-- like literally flock to them because hey! we out here! And they'd.... kind of dismiss me for various arbitrary reasons. Same with trying to join a grad chapter for a sorority. I don't know what it is there to prove that I'm unambiguously Black and interested in them but I feel like the onus is largely on me to prove that to be accepted when I'm just being myself.\n\nOn the other hand, I do find it quite curious though, that my older sister and I grew up in the same environment for the most part, speak the same, and she dresses in designer threads. But she's always had predominately Black friends or POC friends as well as boyfriends, whereas mine have been more yt leaning. I feel like she's more grounded in her Blackness and I'm working on it because it's like...yes, I love indie rock music and concerts, ballet dancing, hiking, insert whatever stereotypical yt hobby etc. and have relaxed hair (just like my sister) but I was still raised in an all Black family with Black parents  with Black culture and history that I love and embrace. Even without all of that, I'm still a Black woman living a Black experience.\n\nTL;DR On one hand, I feel like I am \"not Black enough\" for the Black women I've encountered/tried to befriend, and they become very vicious with me because they find my hobbies, the way I speak, how I look etc. to be \"yt pandering\" or \"uppity\" yet it's not always comforting or mutual to have yt friends either because, at least in my experience, they don't even try to understand my cultural experiences. I also am straight up done with being/feeling like a token. While we may share the same hobbies and interests, my yt friends have been openly dismissive of how I and other Black people are treated in society. I have learned over so many times how dangerous it is to have close yt friends and have accepted that but at the same time, I don't want to give up on my community either. Not sure what is the deal?",

    "text": "It is so validating to confirm my experience of living in one of the most racist gaslighting states (Minnesota) It is so validating to confirm my experience of living in one of the most racist gaslighting states (Minnesota)\n\nI just saw this picture showing Minnesota is one of the most racist states in the country---so validating (see link below). I knew MN racism was really bad at my core but you get gaslighted so much here that you start questioning your reality. People act like there is no racism here because \"people are so nice.\" White fragility is real here... like narcissists, white people act racist, deny it, make themselves the victims, then put the blame on you. They are so passive aggressive that the racism is so subtle, ex: moving away from you out of fear like you are this big threat. I am a woman and I've learned to keep a lot of physical distance from white women and to not make eye contact---which by the way, is super offensive as a feminine woman. If you aren't going out of your way to be super friendly and make them comfortable, you are a threat. I have had my own white relatives act suspicious of me for visiting and trying to get to know  them. I have always felt so isolated being a higher educated middle class black mixed woman. I've been treated as a criminal by my own employers. One time I walked into my first therapy job and the co-workers spoke to my white supervisor instead of me---they were so shocked and uncomfortable when they found out I was the therapist. The social class and job discrimination is so strong here, they are shocked to see professional black people. Being around all this white supremacy makes you question yourself and internalize their messages... You question your sanity, if you are bad, the problem.. when really they are the problem. They have the history of stealing and killing all groups of people for centuries but somehow they see themselves as the victims. White narcissistic delusion.\n\nThere also isn't much of a community of black professionals. From my experience, there are a lot of black (especially mixed) people who are in denial and will gaslight you about racism, too. I have had a lot of bad experiences with mixed black people who are in denial of their blackness, talk about how they pass for other races, and allign with whiteness. They distance themselves from their blackness and some seem delusional because they do not see that they do look part black.\n\nIt seems like the black/mixed people who make it to the top are the ones who have assimilated, have internalized racism, are not unified with other black people, and have had to swallow the racism they have had to experienced. I could not do that for long without it eating me up. I spoke up for myself and others. As humans, we are not supposed to be abused and just take it.. but somehow as black people, white people see us as less than human and think we are immuned and should just take it.\n\nI am burnt out. I barely leave the house. White people are everywhere here and I don't trust most. When I am around them, I dissociate to avoid feeling the pain of all of their violent \"microaggressions.\" Thankfully for now, I work at a black business. Moving out of this state is mandatory for my sanity. I wish all black people could leave as well. It is hard to succeed and progress here without losing a part of yourself. At least I know I managed to survive (and suceeded educationally and built resiliency) one of the most racist states, it can only get better from here as I move on to a more equitable state.\n\n[Racial Disparity MN pic](https://www.zippia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/racial_disparity_map_worst_states.jpg)",

    "text": "Is it possible to have a healthy relationships with yt women/yt people as a Black woman... if at all? So this may be a controversial topic, but I haven't found very much literature or YouTube videos on it so I thought I'd ask and also open up the discussion. Feel free to add your own perspectives as I can only draw from my own; I know everyone will have a different view. \n\nBackground: I grew up and lived in mostly conservative leaning yt areas my entire life. My parents felt that if we were integrated into predominately yt areas, we'd have 'better' schooling and more opportunities for us. With that, though, they made sure we went to a Black church, made Black friends (in school, even if it was literally 2 other kids and also outside of our school) and we we raised in a Black af household (consumed Black media, had Black dolls, Black literature, celebrated our culture etc). So at home and in intimate spaces, we were free to be Black. In those yt spaces, though, it was pretty beaten into me that I was \"othered,\" \"ugly,\" \"disruptive\" etc. and I really took that to heart. I was really tired of never being picked by boys I'd liked and for feeling like I was a problem to people around me.\n\nI did have a healthy racial mix of friends, but I would say the older I got, most of my friendships and best friendships were with yt people. I was the \"cool\" Black friend. When I went to a PWI college, I still had a mix of friends, but I started to notice I placed a lot of my self esteem and emphasis on yt friends and yt male suitors. At the time I was thinking \"Oh, I just like yt guys it's fine\" but I did notice that I would put up with A LOT more shit from yt men that I would, say a Black guy or another MOC who were being fuckboys. I was much more dismissive of them when they exhibited bad behavior. I was also really dependent on my best friend at the time, a yt woman who claimed to \"understand\" people of color, especially Black people bc she was around them \"more than\" I was.\n\nOver time, I sat with that and was basically like, \"What the fuck?\" about my mindset and sought therapy. Clearly I had internalized racism issues and saw myself through a yt gaze and wanted their validation, which while disturbing, made sense for the behavior I was exhibiting. With George Floyd happening last year, about 85% of my \"friends\" were dropped because it was glaringly evident they might have loved *me* but not *Black people*. Same with the men that I'd called my boyfriends in the past. All of them were grossly racist, but I was walking around here thinking I was the exception, which, yeah, is pretty laughable and absurd to me now. \n\nI worked on dismantling that and accept myself more now. But I can't help but feel either gross apathy or just slight disgust and exhaustion at yt people, particularly yt women and their behavior. Though, it's inescapable and excused because that’s what’s put forth to us by society. Because I thought for so long if I could assimilate to it that I was safe from harsh treatment, it's extremely apparent that the level of audacity and passive aggression is just unmet and it's tiresome. It’s a losing game. The level of disrespect is tiresome. The feeling like you are seen as a \"threat\" or as a sex object is tiresome. The fact that BW’s worth is toyed with constantly is tiresome. The lack of empathy is tiresome. \n\nEven the lack of respect from my former best friend who claimed she wanted to \"listen and learn\" from me, turned on me (or rather told on herself for the 100th time) the second I tried to speak because it's now an \"attack\" on her. Or, even thinking how I grew up and constantly being told I am ugly and dirty, yet the same people who think that way pay for lips and ass to look like ours now. Or the folks who do all of the TikTok/Black Twitter stealing and the Kylie Jenners of the world trying so hard to be Black or steal Black media just enough to be cool but not really empathize or want to walk in our shoes. I work with mediocre yt men everyday who love to try to talk down to me and I think \"These were the men I was drooling over 5 years ago? What do they actually have to offer?\" Even the ones who say they are for social justice now-- several of my former colleagues who sat by and were quiet as a mouse while I was psychologically bullied by my yt female managers in front of them (I was the only Black person/woman on the team) are up here trying to \"amplify\" Black voices and march for racial justice saying how wrong it is. Did you not understand what you were doing before though? \n\nThere isn't a lot written about POC's dislike or hatred towards yt people in an everyday sense, and not even to promote it or to be comical but just to say that dealing with racist incidents/internalized racism and just overall generational trauma can cause feelings of that and what that does to relationships with non POC. There’s conversation about how Black folks don’t want to explain racism to yt people bc it’s on them. I see more articles and studies of how yt women are jealous of minority women and have self esteem issues and insecurities because of it, which I see that and find that interesting too. There's much written on how harmful Black female stereotypes are and how harmful yt feminism is, which is appreciated. I just wish there was more said about how Black women feel about always having to feel like they can never measure up to society's yt standard of being and the level of exhaustion or disdain that can come from it. Because I know for me, a lot of how I am seen, how I saw myself as a person and how I am treated as a Black woman is measured up against how I am NOT a yt women and never will be, if that makes sense. It would be good to have in the discourse on how Black women can even have healthy relationships at all with the majority of people perpetuating yt supremacy. Because when you think about it, how??? And why would we outside of survival?\n\nIt's absolutely right and reasonable to kick yt people off the pedestal because... they are just people and their ytness doesn't equal superiority as much as they think and believe it does, but now I feel exhausted and general disgust. It's kind of awkward because I feel I don't know how to have healthy interactions with them without feeling like most of what they are saying is BS or that it's disingenuous, a competition, a gatekeep to make them feel they aren't racist or that they'd turn on me like many have in the past while saying in your face \"we're all women! we're sisters!\"/ \"we're friends! we love YOU!\" and not even try to understand your point of view or have an ounce of empathy for you. Also not saying this doesn't exist to a certain extent in our community either, but I think it's more risky and dangerous in yt spaces.\n\nHas anyone else felt this way? What are your thoughts?",

I’m leaving this town soon enough, thank god, but it’s been hell. I’ve learned to avoid all other moms by this point. My daughter is in kindergarten and she looks almost completely white. I’m asian. People treat me like I don’t exist. They will talk to my FIVE year old before they even talk to me. After school, the moms gather and arrange their play dates and they treat me like I’m some random nanny. There have been times when assistant teachers greet every single mom and then they don’t even look at me, or they look at me and then proceed to take my daughter from my hand without saying a word to me. \n\nI’ve been to play centers where some people just stare at me until I stare back at them and they make some stupid excuse like “omg your daughter looks just like you.” someone literally said that and I had to pretend I actually believed that horseshit.

He was a Filipino who came to the United States as a sailor aboard a ship commanded by Captain Joseph Foster of Leonidas, Michigan. After Captain Foster retired from the sea and settled on a Michigan farm, Felix joined him as a farmhand. In December of 1863, he joined the 11th Michigan Regiment just in time to take part in General William Tecumseh Sherman's Atlanta Campaign. As part of this campaign, the Union Army followed a scorched earth policy. They burned fields and houses, razed businesses, and destroyed railroad tracks in an effort to destroy the South's will to fight along with their ability to resupply the Confederate forces. The 11th Michigan was involved in several skirmishes and battles throughout this campaign.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j5pob2tpk1q61.jpg?width=445&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00ee409d82fdb17c11ee56f976973fd03386eb37\n\nPrivate Balderry served through the end of the war and was mustered out of service in September of 1865. He subsequently returned to Michigan where he worked as a tailor. In 1885 at the age of 39, he married a 16 year old girl named Ada May Barns in Constantine, Michigan.  He died of  tuberculosis in 1895 at the age of 49.\n\nThis is Corporal Joseph Pierce of the 14th Connecticut. At the age of ten, his father sold him into slavery to Amos Peck, a sea Captain. He was nicknamed \"Joe\" by the crew. The Captain later gave him the family name of \"Pierce\" in honor of President Franklin Pierce. Although he was technically a slave, after the two month sea voyage from Canton, China to Hartford, Connecticut, he was raised as a family member of the Peck household.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/golha4brk1q61.jpg?width=385&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b29fff77eaac2c588e8224527746bafa846aad3\n\nIn 1862 he enlisted in the 14th Connecticut Regiment. The 14th was part of the Second Army Corps in the Army of the Potomac. Joseph Pierce has the distinction of being the only Asian to have fought at Gettysburg. During his time in the Union's service, Joseph Pierce fought in 34 battles and skirmishes.\n\nAs a result of his bravery at Gettysburg which included voluntarily joining a skirmish line that had advanced on the Confederates, he was promoted to Corporal on November 1, 1863. While this rank may not be considered very high, it should be remembered that the Union had a segregated army. Black men served in black regiments that were commanded by white officers. Since Asians were largely unknown in the United States, people didn't know how to classify them. Some thought that Asians were mulattos (of mixed race ancestry). Others thought that they might be Native Americans. The fact that Corporal Pierce was actually given rank over subordinate white privates was really quite astounding given the time period.\n\nCorporal Pierce served with the 14th Connecticut until the end of the war and marched with his regiment during the \"Grand Review\" in Washington, DC on May 23. He was mustered out of the army on May 31, 1865.\n\nAfter the war he returned to Connecticut where he worked as an engraver for a silver company. In 1876 he married a woman named Martha Morgan from Portland, Connecticut.\n\nHe died on January 3, 1916 at the age of 73 in his home.\n\nAnother Chinese who served in the Civil War was Edward Day Cahota. At the age of 4, he was found with an older 6 year old boy as stowaways on an American merchant vessel that was commanded by Captain Day. The children were starving and did not know their names. The older boy died just two days later and was buried at sea. The Captain named the younger child Edward and in time Edward became a cabin boy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Edward Day Cahota](https://preview.redd.it/rptamw4tk1q61.jpg?width=147&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10f42c86cdf3339b46d1f3f1e2a63d789b8f1f05)\n\nWhen Captain Day retired, he brought his cabin boy home with him to  Gloucester, Massachusetts . When Edward insisted upon having a third name, he took the name Cahota which was the name of the ship that he had served upon.\n\nIn 1864, Edward Day Cahota joined the 23rd Massachusetts Infantry. After mustering out of the army at the end of the Civil War, he reenlisted in 1866 and fought in the Indian campaigns. One of the more memorable experiences he had during his time in the western service was when he stood guard over Chief Sitting Bull. He told his family that the chief was really quite friendly. It should be noted that Chief Sitting Bull led the Western and Northern Cheyenne at the Battle of Little Bighorn in which General George Armstrong Custer and the 7th Cavalry were surrounded and slaughtered in 1876.\n\nEdward Cahota died on November 18, 1935 and was buried two days later at Mt. Hope Cemetery in Valentine, Nebraska. One of his dreams that was never realized was to become a citizen of the United States. Despite having served in the Army, he was ineligible to become a citizen after the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed in 1882.\n\nIt's estimated that 58 Asians fought in the U.S. Civil War. While most of them fought for the union, at least two fought for the Confederacy. Picture below are Chang and Eng Bunker. They were Siamese twins who came to the United States to join the PT Barnum Circus. After leaving the circus they settled in North Carolina where they married two white sisters. They lived on a farm and were slave owners.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Chang and Eng Bunker](https://preview.redd.it/q067sopvk1q61.jpg?width=406&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e034a2eff384795d3187e3187be0b3c9aa419ff)\n\nWhen the Civil War began, two of their sons, Christopher and Stephen joined the Confederate Army. Since they each had horses and all of the associated gear, they served in the 37th Virginia Cavalry.\n\nIn 1864, Christopher Bunker was wounded and captured in a skirmish at  Moorefield, West Virginia. He was sent to Camp Chase which was outside Columbus, Ohio. Camp Chase was the largest Federal POW camp in the United States.\n\nThe Union didn't spend much money on Confederate POWs. Christopher was housed in a crowded barrack with 197 other prisoners. The union's rations were so meager that at one point, Christopher and his fellow prisoners were reduced to eating cooked rats. On March 4, 1865 he was freed as part of a prisoner exchange between the Union and Confederate forces.\n\nAfter the war, he and his cousin Stephen returned to North Carolina where they resumed farming albeit without slaves since all slaves had been emancipated during the war.",

    "text": "What Was Your Favorite Childhood Food? Given the large number of negative posts (which is thoroughly understandable given the rise of anti-Asian rhetoric and violence going on in this country), I thought I would try to post something positive.\n\nI'm a 3rd generation ABC (American born Chinese). Although most of my relatives are doctors and attorneys, I became a teacher. I started out as an elementary teacher but after 17 years I burned out and went to culinary school. My father said I was having a mid-life crisis. After graduating and working in the food service industry for a few years, I returned to education as the chef instructor of a high school Culinary Arts program. I have now been teaching Culinary Arts for fourteen years.\n\nAlthough I grew up eating typical American breakfast foods i.e. bacon and eggs, pancakes, French toast, waffles, cereal, and oatmeal; one of my favorite food memories growing up was of my grandmother's sticky rice which we would often have for breakfast whenever we visited my paternal grandparents. Grandmother would steam glutinous rice and mix it with fried onions, crumbled hard boiled eggs, chopped Chinese sausages and other ingredients prior to wrapping it in banana leaves and steaming them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/om2oe3qj50o61.jpg?width=610&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86149a4e55c2e3627c03028b5edfb5254b78dcb7\n\nSince grandmother had very conservative views of gender roles, I wasn't allowed in the kitchen to watch her make these because boys had no place in the kitchen (according to her worldview). Since my sister and my female cousins had no interest in cooking, I'm sorry to say that grandmother's recipe was lost when she passed on.\n\nAlthough I have done my best to replicate her recipe, I've never quite managed to get the taste right.\n\nWhat I have managed to get right is the production of chicken congee, though my family typically called this \"jook\". It'd be hard to mess up a jook since it's nothing more than rice boiled to pieces in what is usually a flavorful broth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a06p6sap70o61.jpg?width=258&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e149b6db2b1029e48744a9ad0c8a81d1ee0fc1cd\n\nMy father preferred a plain jook with a garnish of green onions. In contrast, my grandmother always had a wide variety of toppings to add. These toppings included pork floss (yuk sung), fried dough, and all sorts of vegetables. I personally liked cracking a raw egg into the bowl and pouring the hot jook over the egg. The heat from the soup would soft cook the egg and the first spoonful would typically break the yolk. When drizzled with some light soy sauce and a touch of sesame seed oil, I thought this dish was heavenly.\n\nWhat are your favorite childhood food memories?",

    "text": "#WeArePeopleToo: A Proposal for a New Movement Hi everyone, this is my first post ever on Reddit despite being an avid Redditor. I apologize if I lack any specific Reddit-based decorum when it comes to making a post. I will definitely get better with time!\n\nMy name is Dae and I'm an NYC public school educator in my late 20s. I am a mixed race male and would like to share my story as well as establish my thoughts on a movement to better represent us as mixed-raced humans of the world.\n\n**My Story**\n\nI was born to a Trinidadian mother and a Korean father. As a result of their marriage, my father's side of the family became estranged and cut ties with us. As a result, I have only managed to forge a relationship with the Trinidadian side of my family. I grew up in a fairly Republican/Conservative area of NYC (Staten Island) in which white people were the majority.\n\nMy parents loved me but they had no idea how to deal with raising a multiracial son. They were stern and strict and did not believe in a coddling love. They did, however, believe in the merits of education and made sure that I knew to bring the best grades home. In school, other students stayed away from me. They were polite as young children but they often ostracized me and left me out of activities. At the time I didn't know it was because of how I looked but with time I began to see the relationship. I learned the power of being a fool, of being self-depreciating. As people laughed at me, I saw it as their acceptance. What I had actually done was prime them to note my difference, my mixed-race status, as being something comical, something to decry, deride, and deplore.\n\nI became the class clown and stood to make problems for the sake of other's entertainment. Teachers began to hate me and associate me as a problem child. They suggested mental and learning disabilities despite my high grades due to my parents and their iron fist approach to education. With every letter home, phone call, parent-teacher conference, I would receive a beating from my parents. Slaps in the face, beatings with belts, name calling, screaming in a child's face, bruises on my body. All done for the sake of being accepted by my peers. All for the sake of being loved by someone. I learned that people who love you are allowed to do whatever they want to your body so I let others do what they wanted to me. Friends treated me like a punching bag. At the age of 8 my 13 year-old babysitter blackmailed me into allowing her to rape me. I said nothing, scared more at the idea that I would be in trouble if people knew I had sex because I knew enough to know sex was wrong.\n\nBy the time I was 12 in middle school, I had tried to hurt myself for the first time. I was taken to the guidance counselor because I had told a friend who, doing the right thing, told an adult. In the process, I was treated like I was crazy. I was threatened to be committed because I was a danger to myself. All of this made me feel *different* and I already knew *different* was bad. I knew because of how I felt when people told me I was different. \"What are you?\" \"Who is black?\" \"How did that happen?\" \"Are you \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?\" The looks of confusion. Even worse was the looks of incredulity, like the fact that I existed couldn't be real. People, regardless of their own race, made me feel so ugly. Ugly because I was different, unique, and beautiful because of my uniqueness.\n\nI knew my parents' union was odd because people told me that. But I didn't know the history of miscegenation in America. I did not know that it was once a crime to be us or to engage in a union that results in the creation of one of us. What I did experience, however, was fetishization as I grew up and became sexually active again. I had a hard time finding someone who thought we had enough of a connection to date one another. When I did, I immediately agreed to date them, I was thirsty for love and affection. But this love was ugly too because it was different. This was even present in friendships. I had friends who told me they would only date black girls because they were black and wanted to have black babies. I had friends who told me I was smart because I was Asian and knew some rap and had rhythm because my mom was Black.\n\nMy girlfriends never, ever brought me home. I was a secret, forever to be hidden. I grew attached to a concept that white girls were the most beautiful. This was partially because of where I grew up but also out of jealousy. White people had such an ownership of their heritage. They knew what they were and forged relationships based on those identities. I wanted so badly to be white. I told my mother that I liked white girls and that in my next life I'd like to be white because they rule the world. My hatred of my blackness stemmed from the fact that society deemed black inferior which led me to believe that my blackness was probably why my interactions with society were so awful. If only I were fully Asian or White and had no blackness to me. I didn't realize it was just because I was mixed. The one girlfriend who took me home only told her family I was Asian. During the death of Eric Garner on Staten Island as racial tensions spilled out onto the streets, I visited her family and had to grimace as they joked about, \"Hands Up, Don't Shoot\". She said nothing. She did nothing. I didn't expect her to.\n\nMy life spiraled out of control as I got older and race became more important as a qualifier in making connections with people. I fell in deep love with a girl from a family who practiced the Islamic faith. She had difficulties accepting her role in the religion and found solace in me, a person with no ties to any culture because my culture was so shattered by my being multiracial. She would often tell me how \"cool\" it was that I was Black and Asian. How \"attractive\" it was. I didn't know what she was doing was fetishizing me, I was desperate to believe she loved me. After a few years, the relationship fell apart and, again, it was because I was different. This time, however, I knew it was because of my race. I never hated myself so much in my life. I cursed myself and my family, I wished I could be one thing.\n\nI drank a lot after the breakup. I wanted to die. I woke up face down in the gutter one night after binge-drinking. I tried to slice my wrists in my backyard, then I tried to fall on the knife. I tried to jump off the overpass by my house into traffic. I wanted my death to be certain. I gained so much weight my heartbeat became erratic. I was smoking a pack a day and developed a wheeze. I hated myself, I needed to punish myself. I fought my father, I ran away from home and became homeless. I hurt and hurt and hurt because love seemed impossible because acceptance was impossible.\n\nI became a teacher. First in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn where my students, forever ready to curse me out and let me know when I wasn't being \"fair\", accepted me. Almost instantly. They asked what I was, were relieved when they heard \"Black\" because they knew we shared something common, and then made me one of their own. They joked with me, told me gossip, shared their fears, shared their dreams and their emotions. They asked me to share my stories and for the first time, **ever**, someone wanted to truly know me. Now I teach in the South Bronx where my students have yet to ask me what I am. Because it does not matter to them.\n\nI began a journey to heal. I lost weight though exercise, something I was so hesitant to do because I hated myself and wanted to die. I took a road trip from NY to Georgia, across to New Orleans, Louisiana then to Texas, then Cali. I got to see the Pacific Ocean and looked across to imagine my father's country. We drove back and I was refreshed with a new look on life. I educated myself on race relations in America as BLM became a massive presence following the death of George Floyd and learned to love my blackness. I attended my first protest on Staten Island with BLM and learned the importance of being outspoken. I learned to love myself and I learned how to share that love with others. I challenged my perceptions of education and decided to dedicate my life towards bringing a sense of ownership when it comes to science for BIPOC students. By providing students with a more hands-on experience, they learn that science is a gift for all humanity in the form of a community, one that it is honorable to be a part of. I have since been selected to work on a committee that brings more diversity toward l\n\n**The Movement**\n\nThrough my research, I have become extremely disillusioned with the lack of support provided to people of mixed race. I grew up with no one to turn to, no one to help me unpack the burden of being an oddity to society. I left social media, angry, vowing to never use it again because I didn't want to interact with a society that could not accept me. I likened it to being desperate, to chasing the desire to belong to something that has no desire to accept me.\n\nI fell upon Beverly Daniel Tatum's national bestseller, \"Why Are All The Black Kids Sitting Together In The Cafeteria?\" and noted that it was revised and updated. I had never had interest in reading this book before, despite it being mentioned in conversations with friends, teachers, etc. I did not belong to the black culture and so social issues of segregation were particularly damning to me. How could I sympathize with a culture that told me I wasn't black or black enough? At least they had one another in their culture to lean on. I had no one, I felt. In the revised edition, Dr. Tatum places attention to the role that Multiracial families bring to a discussion of race relations in America. Yet, in one fell swoop, she manages to disenfranchise me and other mixed-raced people, \"Given the unique historical and contemporary context, it is the biracial identity development of children of Black and White parents that I will focus on here.\" (Tatum, 304) I was not even enough to garner attention by a champion of Civil Rights and Equality in a book that was groundbreaking in its ability to unpack race relations in my country. I began to wonder how many other mixed-race people felt this way.\n\nI realized that we are under-represented and our lack of support allows us to be targets for confusion. It is this confusion to what we are, to how people treat us, that results in self-hatred, self-depreciation, self-loathing, and self-harm. And we cannot wait for others to be our voice because we are in need. As more attention is being placed towards identifying racism throughout the world, we need to be vocal, we need to stand to let people know: WE ARE THE DISENFRANCHISED TOO. WE ARE PEOPLE TOO.\n\nAnd that has been the movement I've been slowly pushing over social media. I want it to take off. I want us to unify and represent a community that has lacked a true community for so long. #wearepeopletoo\n\nAs people, we deserve to be treated like others. This means we deserve the freedom to be equals in society. We deserve to walk down the street or to make a new friendship without being asked for our race or ethnicity because #wearepeopletoo. We deserve to love and be loved not fetishized because #wearepeopletoo. We deserve to feel like we belong in our families, in our schools, in our government, in our country because #wearepeopletoo.\n\nRight now, the movement is just a hashtag. But even the largest movements begin somewhere. I will not pretend to know what I am doing. I will not pretend to be a leader or to stand as someone to look up to. I believe that this movement needs to be decentralized. No single leader, just a group of people, human beings, who see the need for a change. Right now I am using IG to push the hashtag but I want to begin moving to other platforms, putting out writing, establishing a website. I hoped we could establish [r/mixedrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/mixedrace) as a basis for a headquarters or begin to discuss a place to brainstorm. I stand with all people of the world and I want them to begin to see us as people too. #wearepeopletoo I know I need help, I need teammates and a community to support and be supported by. Even now as I tell people my idea for this movement they tell me I am being divisive, that I am causing more division in the world. But this was division that was forced on me, not one that I created. My goal is to end this division. I share that belief, that one they call utopic, that the world will be better when we see ourselves as one race: the human race.\n\nThank you for hearing me out,\n\nDae",

Recent one e.g. asking all boys to stand up and apologise for their sins e.g. gained media attention and outrage by parents.\n\nIf your school does girl sessions for STEM or sports, this is great and to be encouraged. Ask your schools what they are doing gor boys also. Are they trying to increase boys entrollment in college? The gender gap in exlcusions, leaving school with no qualifications etc.\n\nGender equality is great, but it needs to mean gender equality. Do not exlude boys from the good programmes you have for girls, and do not poison these programmes with false anti male ant boy idealogy.\n\nHere is a great report by Save the Children, that rarely actually looks at boys in educations very thoroughly. It has some great insights into just how pervasive this problem is. Sadly it doesnt mention the teacher bias much, but it covers most other things.\n\n[https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/content/dam/global/reports/the\\_lost\\_boys\\_report.pdf](https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/content/dam/global/reports/the_lost_boys_report.pdf)\n\nHere is a great comment by a user:\n\n# Imagine  a 14 yr old girl, all her teachers were mostly men.  In her country  girls are marked less than boys for the same work.  In her country girls  are much more likely to be disciplined, to be expelled, and not to  finish school.  In her country, almost all primary caregivers are men.   Fewer women than men have gone to college for at least 40 years.  But of  course the efforts to get more men into college march steadily on.  She  is surrounded by Boy Power and The Future is Male!  Academic journals  will print anything that denigrates her sex, even if its something  Hitler wrote as long as jews are replaced with women.\n\n# (and  this bias exists in almost every single institution...she will receive  harsher sentences for the same crime, she is about 10x more likely to be  shot than a man, she is much more likely to be a victim of a violent  crime, she will die sooner, less will be spent on her healthcare, there  will be fewer programs for her across every single government agency.   She will commute further, she will work longer, she will be 20x more  likely to die on the job, etc etc)\n\n# But  despite those facts, she goes to school to learn about how everything  is setup to benefit her.  About how bad her gender is, how toxic so many  of its traits are, how oppressive it has been throughout all of space  and time.  That despite her obvious reality, she lives in a world of  abundant privilege.  See come to find out, everyone actually treats her  better because of she is a she.  Theres no shit, a Boys Are Wonderful  effect.. like scientifically fucking proven....but nonono its girls that  are treated the best.  Theres no data to confirm this (quite the  opposite).... its just so.  Theres really no data for almost any of this  at all.\n\n# Further, that she needs  to be an ally to boys and help them all she can.  Even though a not so  quiet part of them really do chant \"Killallwomen\" and \"female tears  sustain me\"....just ignore that.\n\n# And  when she raises any point, however timid about how none of this matches  her lived experiences.....well she is struggling with her femininity  and God help us if she finds a video on the internet by a professor who  may say she isnt a goddamn monster.\n\n# What a backwards fucking world that would be huh?\n\nI will also add, rough and tumble play and rough housing - the type of play fathers do - is critical for boys and girls development, it is especially important in boys.... its has really wide reaching benifits, e.g. confidence, emotional regulation, behaviour management.... this is done by father usually and mothers usually do not do this type of play.\n\nThe combination of fatherlessness, less fathers in childcare, and absence of men in teaching as well as the health and safety culture in education (bad combination with an already feminised work force too) all adds up to really missing out for boys.\n\nHere is importance of rough housing:\n\n[https://youtu.be/QAbkUpVfkTs](https://youtu.be/QAbkUpVfkTs)\n\n[https://youtu.be/ryVSS0q2FCM](https://youtu.be/ryVSS0q2FCM)\n\nThis is also a tip for all the fathers and uncles etc out there.... this is excellent to know for your sons/ daughters etc that thist type of play is really good for them\n\nI am much more hands on in play with nephew now and I notice how easy it is to manage his behaviour now, how much he aboslutely adores playing with me now, whereas previously no one could get him still to change clothes (well his father could!), go in car seat, I can easily do it now, his behaviour is good etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nComment in Guardian post linked above:\n\nTo clarify a few points raised:\n\n\\- In our first study, (not me im copying/pasting this) we found that girls from Reception (aged 4  or 5) and boys from Year 3 (aged 7 or 8) thought that girls were  superior students to boys in every way.  This included perceptions of  conduct, motivation, achievement, and even intellectual ability. This  latter finding surprised us - we find it rather shocking and sad that  boys this age have picked up this self-effacing stereotype.- In addition to this stereotype, our first study  uncovered what's known as a \"meta-stereotype\": not only do kids think  girls are better students, they believe adults think so, too.- These \"meta-stereotypes\" are important because  previous research has shown that they can be self-fulfilling.  Kids can  become anxious because they are aware that they are expected to perform  badly, on the basis of the social group to which they belong (e.g.,  race, class, and in this case, gender).  This is know as \"stereotype  threat\" .  As a result, \"experimental groups\" of kids who are reminded  of such expectations do worse than \"control groups\" of kids who are not.- Indeed, this is what we found in our second study.   Being reminded of the general expectancy that girls will do better  harmed boys' performance in SATs-type tests.  Notably, it did NOT boost  girls' performance.  From this, we can provisionally conclude that the  stereotypes in question harm boys, academically, without benefitting  girls.  By implication, undoing or neutralizing these expectations ought  (in principle) to help boys, without compromising girls' achievement.- We did NOT examine where these expectations and  anxieties come from.  We have no data to suggest, for example, that it  is teachers' fault. On the contrary, in our experience teachers bend  over backwards to be inclusive and fair. Rather, we are inclined to  believe that widely shared social stereotypes of gender are more  important. Pre-school and out-of-school experiences are likely to be  very powerful shapers of gender stereotypes.- Nonetheless, schools are an obvious place to start if  we want to break the \"spell\" of the stereotype that boys are inferior  students.  One thing that we are beginning to try is simply  communicating to boys and girls that we do not expect them to perform  differently. (Note: this is not the same thing as telling them that they  are the same in any other way, be it culturally or biologically.) In  any case we hope our research will stimulate debate and especially  creative solutions to the problem that boys seem to be facing.- Note that we would not suggest for a second that  stereotypes are the only reason that on average, boys tend to struggle  at most age groups and in most subjects, relative to girls.  We are just  trying to identify one piece in the puzzle.- Also, of course, in some subjects and in some  contexts boys go on to do better, as in the highest levels of  Nobel/Fields lists.  Many (including us, as it happens) would also argue  that later in life, men are advantaged relative to women.  It's  tempting therefore to conclude that the gender gap at school is not a  big deal.  But our view is that any arbitrary and avoidable limitation  on the potential of any group in society ultimately costs us all.  It is  also our view - a point of value rather than science - that we should  not view gender relations as a zero-sum game; that men's  underachievement is a kind of victory or compensation for women, for  example.  And therefore, we find it a problem that although men are  over-represented in many fields of excellence, they are also  over-represented in the field of academic failure.  We hope our research  will one day help give boys a lift and therefore help everyone.- That said, we don't claim that our work is  ground-breaking - we are simply applying the well-demonstrated concept   of \"stereotype threat\" to try to help  understand what's causing boys  and girls to perform differently.  It's \"applied\" rather than \"pure\"  research.  And certainly, our work says little or nothing about whether  girls and boys should be schooled separately, taught in the same way, or  by men, and so on.- However, there is one general moral that I hope  people take away from our research, as from much of the social  psychological research that it follows.   Stereotypes (of say race,  class, and gender) have a way - myriad ways - of fulfilling themselves.   They don't require that parents, teachers, or the media explicitly tell  a certain group that certain things are expected of them.  Thus we  should not conclude from the poor performance, disadvantaged position,  bad conduct or even low IQ scores of any group that it is innately or  inevitably inferior.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "text": "A note from a man who really should have known better. Good day to all,\n\nFirst post so go easy.\n\nThis post is six months after the fact, and a means for me to let out my feelings but if they can be helpful or of use to anyone in any way that is fantastic.\n\nI am fully aware that I come across like I never stand up for myself, I do but in the later years of a long term relationship you learn to hold your tongue, you learn what is worth saying and what is going to lead to unnecessary drama. I also realise I stayed in this relationship FAR too long, mostly due to knowing that my kids would be used against me. \n\nI just turned 40 in November last year, I'm sure MANY people have it worse than me and I am aware that 2020 was just a disaster for everybody. \n\nGrowing up I wasn't one of those guys that new at a young age exactly what I wanted to pursue in life when it came to career, I finished high school and had already been working in retail part time since I'd turned 15.  I did study psychology for six months at university, but chose to bail out as I had to pay a mortgage and pay the bills, I had made the very silly decision to marry young at 23 and live the so called picket fence dream.\n\nWell for obvious reasons, myself not having grown up and lived enough, that marriage last just six months. All the time I am working in retail management, most of the time I could find some sort of passion in what I was doing, but there are always the times where no matter how many sixteen hour days you put in, no matter how hard you work, your balls will be busted by upper management no matter what and it was always super infuriating given what I was giving to the company and the salary I was on. This is common place, anyone who has worked retail knows how the game works, plenty of free hours given and not an ounce of gratitude or respect from the big guys. You are a number, a very replaceable number.\n\nBy the time I am thirty I have found what I assumed a nice girl, we start a family and having children was now the most beautiful, inspiring and best thing I had done in my life. I work hard, still in retail and starting to have more and more days when finding the passion and good spirit was more and more difficult. But I man up, I take it on the chin. I have a family to provide for and nothing will stop me on that mission, I'd had some disagreements with my partner, about what we were both contributing to the household. Over the years the arguments escalated, now we have three girls who are beautiful, each one with her own gorgeous personality and ability to make me crack a smile even on the worst of days. Their cuddles when I walked in late from work, were the absolute best part of my day.\n\nLeading back to the arguments for a minute, for the better part of this relationship, I found myself finishing work and coming home to more work. If I wanted the washing done, if I wanted the kitchen clean and dishes done, if I wanted the floors vacuumed and not be laced with dirty nappies, then I needed to keep my shoes on and get back to it. There were plenty of conversations about it, some heated but majority just asking for some help around the house and to maybe at the least take the kids outside and get them to school everyday.\n\nBy mid 2016 I must have been at my breaking point, I had moved to a new store and my manager was at the very least extremely hard to get along with. It was a personality I had never run into in my then thirty five years, and it wasn't me it was anyone he spoke whether it be staff, reps or customers. Just arrogant, nasty and willing to screw over anyone and everyone until he is right. I was tired all the time, cluster migraines had set back in the first time since high school, obviously the stress and anxiety wasn't mixing well with everything else. I work like this for six months, always telling myself to cop it on the chin and don't react to unnecessary things, just get through the day and put the money in the bank.\n\nOver the years I have gone from a shy teenager who was willing to work hard, to an almost forty year old that is at the end of his rope and will snap at the next disrespectful word spoken to me, my colleagues or my family.\n\nSo six months have passed with this manager, and I find myself in an office upstairs having a full on yelling match, and out of character wanting to throw this dude through the window to the floor below, and if he was still conscious maybe a few more kick for good measure.\n\nI ended up quitting, walking out on the spot. Again out of character, but shit was starting to get to me.\n\nI get home a lot earlier than I usually would, and the child that should be at school is at home sick, but well enough to be running around screaming happily with her sisters. I ask my partner why she's home, \"She's sick\" she tells me. \"Hmm doesn't seem very sick to me\" I respond very quickly still reeling from work. \"What are doing trying start a fight?\" she says snarling and without a fuck to give.\n\nThis was the point in time I immediately stopped giving a fuck about her, at all. I loved my children more than anything and new that if I stated very clearly how I felt to my partner, life was about to get REALLY difficult for me and my children.  \n\nI decided that it was time that retail was going to be put in my past and I would never step into any type of career role that was in the retail/hospitality sector. I spent a year at a local orchard, being outside was fantastic in the summer, not so much in the winter. The job was with a few other guys, putting up new fencing, digging holes, irrigation it was actually really good to be out of a store and have some fellow men to talk to about life's troubles.\n\nEnd of 2018 rolls around, and the living situation is getting dire. By this point I have made a choice to work at work and kick off the shoes when I get home no matter what state it's in, I spend time with my girls, I go to bed. My partner and I hardly speak, and if we do it's about the kids or how much we despise the others behaviour. 2019 rolls in and I am neither working, or cleaning the house, mentally I have checked out completely and not even spending time with my adored children. I am a lump on the couch, I am utterly useless. Depression has really set in, I spend my days on a Playstation trying to think about anything other than my miserable life and how little I have achieved in the forty years I've been on earth.\n\nThis goes on for two whole years, I am ashamed at my behaviour, suicidal thoughts had kicked in. The thought of my children living in this environment disgusted me, and any way out was invisible to me, I simply did not know what to do. \n\nWell late December in 2020, the decision is made for me. It was just another day, I'd woken up late and getting a coffee. An argument erupts between my partner and I over the fact that she had been coming and going from the house for days on end with my children whenever she liked knowing full well it hurt me, the argument was a lot more heated than usual, and and one point we brush up lightly against each others shoulders in a hallway where the kids room intersected. No malice, no ill intent. What did have me disgusted at myself and her was the look on my middle child's face as I calmed down, she was crying, scared at the events that had just taken place, I have never been more ashamed of myself in all my life.\n\nOne hour later police show up at the door while I was cooking dinner, by this time my partner has taken the children outside and had already made a statement. The two officers come to see me inside and ask if everything is ok, and if I possibly have a place to stay until things are worked out. I say no I've spent almost two years at home and lost most of my good friends and connections throughout the relationship. They go outside and speak to my partner once again, they come back in after trying to arrange something with their Sergeant to no avail, and I tell them that I can pack a bag and park the car somewhere to sleep. The officers say no they didn't want that and go outside for a third time and speak to my partner and sergeant once more.\n\nIt is at this point the officers come back inside, and ask me to collect my necessities as I will be going to the police station. I ask if something has happened, and the female officer tells me that my partner has filed domestic abuse charges against me and I needed to leave the house. Shocked, angry and almost crying I collect some stuff in a bag and the officers lead me to the car as my children are watching. The female officer is nice enough to let me get to the other side of the car, before putting me in handcuffs so the kids don't have to see.\n\nIn the car, and overnight I am trying to string together the events leading up. Not only did the officers asked me numerous times if I had somewhere to stay, but were quite sure they were at our home because of an argument. There was no talk of DV the first time they spoke to me, no talk of DV the second time they spoke to me. But third time was the charm, it seems that my partner wasn't getting the desired results so she decide to up the ante, on the adjusted statement I pushed her several times I even swung at her. And the disgusting thing is not only is she on the order but my children as well, not only is she saying I'm a danger to her but my kids too. The police set me up in a motel for a couple weeks before I'm able to secure a one bedroom studio, I get my car back on the road and a job to get things sailing in the right direction. I will not lie the time I spent in that motel was hell for me, not really anyone to talk to and left with these thoughts just rushing through my head 24/7.\n\nI will spare you all the morbid details as this post is TLDRx100 already, but I have managed to get back to a more sensible place in my thinking. As you might understand seeing my children has been very difficult, even though she has fully admitted to making false allegations to the same female police officer from the night she made them. Apparently being a woman, any statement you make is truth. And being a male you are guilty until further notice. Apparently there are absolutely no repercussions for a woman that slanders/defames a man, for no reason other than revenge/bitterness. The only way I am able to see my kids is at school, and that is just the younger two. I have no contact with my older daughter at all at the moment, because parental alienation is a very real thing. All I can do at this point is hope for the best my children get to an age that they can think for themselves, and realise what has been happening and why. I have had to make a choice to back right off, to not give the attention and to not take the bait. I will not be playing games, I will not let my kids be used as pawns and I can no longer let myself deal with the mindfuck. But it is VERY sad to me that this is the environment that they will be living in, this is the person that will be guiding them through their formative years. They are beautiful girls, and I can only hope the influence I've had on them so far when it comes to manners and respect towards themselves and others is enough to get them through to adulthood safely.\n\nIn ending all I can say is take that red pill early guys, and even if you believe you have found the one vet that woman hard. Do not be in a rush to move in, to marry. Do not be in a rush to give everything and receive nothing, do not be in a rush to put your life (and your children's) in the hands of somebody that has nothing to offer you and has no reason to stay in those times you are not living your best life. Walk into a relationship knowing yourself first, and do not bow or lessen the morals and qualities you have for anybody.\n\nI apologise for some of the career long-windedness, I was also making this post in a way to ask the question of where to go with my career at forty. I feel I have a lot of empathy and compassion, and for the last couple of years wanted to enter into either the mental health sector or early development education, the latter because I have a good way with kids but unsure if the male teacher survives in this day and age. I have a lot of passion left in me, and I would so love a career in which I could express that passion. I don't like to think I'm THAT old, but the question is would it even be feasible to spend four years on a diploma while working full time.. \n\nFeel free to share your own stories if you like, even just as a way to get it off your chest, connections have been severed lately and us fella's should stick together.\n\nTake care out their fella's, it's a rough world and only getting worse by the day.",

    "text": "I hate my woke school board My friend showed me this sub and I've been really tempted to post on it, so here I am. This is just a throwaway account because I'm scared of what would happen if I posted this on my main. I hate the fact that now people need to be careful about sharing their real opinions.\n\nI'm a 15-year-old girl in grade 10 and I'm fed up with this feminism shit in school. (and before you point it out, yes I know it's ironic that I'm making this post as a female). A lot of the subjects in my school are dominated with social justice and I hate it. English is the worst of all because my teacher is a social justice warrior and always talks about feminism and race insensitively (also making racist remarks about her fellow white people lol) in front of the whole class. EVERY single start of the class she talks about feminism and how girls are poor little victims, their rights are being disrespected, blah blah blah. I fucking hate it. I'm someone who's victimized for both my race and my gender and I hate it so much.\n\nLast month we started reading books. ALL of the options were about social justice. She was like \"It's better if I let you chose a book, rather than if I just handed you a book by an old dead white guy\" (yes, she really said that). Pretty much all the books had an \"important message\" in them, so I chose a book that seemed to be the least like it would be full of social justice. Turns out the entire fucking book is a message about feminism (as well as racism), the two subjects that bother me more than anything. (The book is called \"Monday's Not Coming\" if you dare to touch it)\n\nWell anyway, I was reading a part of a section today for my school work and so basically some girl is invited to a sleepover with other girls. The sleepover takes an unexpected turn that the main character didn't expect and she ends up going to a party and getting drunk. I PREDICTED what would happen next, and I hate that. Some guy sexually assaults her, of course. Fuck that book. Fuck my life. Fuck everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't even express my anger in words. I don't even know how to properly end this post but it's just great being victimized for your gender and your race :) (I'm mixed by the way). I hate it how the sjws portray women as \"poor little victims aww omg r u ok :'''( oJHDJGSHJVD ARWJKUD GUSKDBM HJKFWSGJdb,hgajfuckingshootme\"\n\na\n\nwxdquodhkfjvsgfxe\n\nd d\n\necfwd\n\nfwxv\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am going to have a meltdown\n\nOkay, that's my vent.

    "text": "Discrimination against Indian men in Western countris Hey Redditors,\n\nI am not Indian myself, however some friends of mine and aquaintances have described that they feel that the women have been specifically targetting them due to large amount of media surrounding rape allegations in India which is reported in the media.\n\nThey explained that there are issues in India in low educated areas, however this is a small proportion of the country concentrated in the south indian regions. India is obviously a vast country with many races. These areas do not at all represented the major cities and other developed educated areas. This being said the media will tend to publish as though it is widespread in India aswell exaggerating the actual incidents prior to any convictions causing stereotyping of Indian men.\n\nThey have been experiencing that white women (not Asians) in Australia tend to discriminate against them in their work places with one describing a situation where even their strata manager had not attended to a complaint they made within the building that they rent appropriately.\n\nTo the Indian men out there, is this something you have personally experienced?",

    "text": "What are the actual statistics on the gender breakdown of child sexual abuse perpetrators? I'm having a discussion with some friends about risk management in child rearing. One of them seems to have the idea that only men are capable of sexually abusing children, and therefore it is a proper precaution that men should never be alone with children (even their own children) for any reason. In line with this, they say sleepovers for any reason would never be allowed. They argue that because the odds of a male offender are dramatically higher, children are substantially safer with this precaution.\n\nI'm aware of the common statistics that men represent 90-99% of child sexual abuse, but I can't seem to find an actual, verifiable source for those numbers anywhere. The numbers are probably true, I'm not trying to refute them, but I want the real numbers to base my arguments on. To be clear, I'm not looking for advice on how to argue against my friend's point (although that's certainly welcome), I'm trying to do their legwork for them. I want the actual data they think they're working with. They're confident enough in their position that they don't feel the need to find the real numbers.\n\nI know I probably won't change their mind, but it would be good for my own education to lock this down.\n\nI tried to find them on my own.\n\nI started with the 2019 [report of child maltreatment](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/cb/data-research/child-maltreatment) (PDF [Here](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cb/cm2019.pdf)), and that is helpful to my case, but the numbers aren't specific enough. The report only talks about aggregate maltreatment, and you can't apply the average gender split in that group to every type of maltreatment.\n\nThe data that report is based on is from the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS), which seems like it would have exactly the data I'm after, but it's locked down. You can't see the data unless you are a university researcher. I didn't find any other reports based on this data that broke down sexual offenses by the perpetrator's gender.\n\nNext I found myself on Wikipedia. They make several interesting claims on the demographics section of their [Child sexual abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse#Demographics) article.\n\n>1) The percentage of incidents of sexual abuse by female perpetrators that  come to the attention of the legal system is usually reported to be  between 1% and 4%.\n\nThe source for this claim is locked behind a paywall. I have no idea what this report's data source is. This is the best I've seen so far, I could take this and apply it to the numbers in the NCANDS to get absolute numbers, but I would prefer something that is independently verifiable. I don't really like trusting that an unknown Wikipedia editor accurately summarized the results in the report.\n\n>2) Studies of sexual misconduct in US schools with female offenders have  shown mixed results with rates between 4% to 43% of female offenders\n\nThis survey is too narrow. Teachers are in a position of authority, I would prefer data that aggregates all offenders, not just looking at one type.\n\n>3) Maletzky (1993) found that, of his sample of 4,402 convicted child sex offenders, 0.4% were female\n\nThis is also behind a paywall, but it seems inappropriate anyway. The survey deals with pedophiles admitted to a specific program, not a survey of all convicts. Female offenders have vastly different categorizations and recidivism rates / reasons, so a program targeted for men is not really something helpful to analyze the gender breakdown. \n\n\\---\n\nThe idea that men make up the majority of child sexual abusers is widespread, it had to come from somewhere. Again, I'm not refuting it, but there has to be a report or data set somewhere that is widely available that would allow the statistic to spread so far. There must be some kind of report, even if it's pure feminism propaganda, summarizing data from the FBI or some state entity. Something that isn't only accessible to universities or people willing to buy articles.\n\nCan anyone help me find this?",

    "text": "Emma Goldman Papers Public History Project In addition to Emma’s birthday on the 27th, June toasts many anniversaries:  a time of the solstice, of pride and of celebrated struggle. While we at the EGPPHP may be more familiar with Berkeley’s infamous June gloom fog, we envy the dry heat and choruses of cicadas and ice cream truck chimes of our eastern neighbors. In tribute to the beginning of the summer season, we thus offer our readers what we hope is a refreshing treat.\nDid you know that Emma Goldman was once the proprietor of not one, but two ice-cream parlors?\n\nShe and her comrade Alexander Berkman longed to participate in the shaping and promise of the early revolution in Russia. How the twenty-something year old Emma could raise money for passage seemed almost insurmountable. Wracking their brains they  conjured up a novel idea of opening an ice cream shop.  Even though she never overcame the fears of the Worcester locals who dared not have their children tainted by the presence of a  notorious anarchists in their midst, they managed to turn a profit. Surreptitiously, an entourage of teenagers snuck out of their homes and lined up to imbibe and luxuriate on Emma’s double scoops of chocolate and vanilla ice cream.\n\nThe first volume of our \ndocumentary edition, Emma Goldman: A Documentary History of the American Years: Made for America, 1890-1901**, documents her first foray into the ice-cream world: “...stirred by accounts of the tsar’s latest atrocities, [Sasha, Emma and Fedya] came upon the all-American idea of opening an ice-cream parlor to fund their return…[b]ut even double scoops could not secure a steady flow of cash, 0ff-season in a hot-weather business, thus dashing their hopes of joining the international supporters of the brewing revolution in their mother country”(Volume 1, p.22).**\nIn the January 16, 1954 issue of The New Yorker, the writer S.A. Behrman recalled visiting the Worcester, Massachusetts location of Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman’s first and successful ice-cream parlor and luncheonette, located at 86 Winter Street (Living My Life, p. 82). \n\n\"The counter was neat, and the blowzy-headed, benevolent deity stood behind it. When...asked ...what I wanted, I was tongue-tied; I fully expected some emanation from the apikorista to pulverize me...When it came—double scoop, twice what you would have got (in town) Miss Goldman left us, and we sat at the counter and ate.”(Behrman, 1954). While Behrman concludes his article with an admission that his recollection may have been a mere false memory, his piece provides a foray into the imagined space.\nA few years later, encouraged by their windfall, they ventured into the proprietorship of yet another ice cream shop--this time in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn--with much less success. Emma launched her second endeavor into the ice cream world in the Spring of 1895 (Volume One, p. 500). Alongside Claus Timmerman and Ed Brady, and with funding from Modest Stein, she opened a parlor in Brownsville, a prominent working class Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. The attempt was unfortunately short-lived: \n“It occured to me that we might try something like our ice-cream parlour in Worcester. It had been successful there; why not in New York? Ed approved of the project and suggested that we proceed at once… I had saved a little money, and Fedya offered us more. Friends advised Brownsville: it was a growing centre, and a store could be got not far from the race-tracks, where thousands of people were passing daily. So to Brownsville we went and fixed up a beautiful place. Thousands did pass by there, but they kept on passing. They were in a hurry to get to the race-track, and on their way home they had already visited some ice-cream store nearer the track… our daily receipts were not enough to cover the venture… Ed tried to laugh away our plight, but he was evidently unhappy. We gave up the business and returned to New York. In three months, we had lost five hundred dollars…”(Living My Life, p. 161).\n\nIn his excellent book, The Dairy Restaurant (Nextbook Press, 2020), Ben Katchor carefully tracks the meals, both eaten and prepared, by Emma: “Through the pages of Emma Goldman’s autobiography, we can chart her socio-political movements by the cafes and restaurants she visits”(Katchor, 280). These included not only establishments she patronized throughout the city and boroughs, including Sachs Cafe (on Suffolk Street), Joseph Knirim’s salon on North William Street, or the Zum Groben Michel Salon, but also Goldman’s very own Worcester and Brownsville parlors. \n\nIn Other News:\n 2021 marks the 150th Anniversary of the Paris Commune, March 18th-May 27, 1871.  Inspired, Emma Goldman often lectured about the significance of the Commune. Subsequently she befriended Louise Michel, communard and anarchist, while Michel was exiled in London. \"Ever since I had read about the Paris Commune, its glorious beginning and its terrible end, Louise Michel had stood out sublime in her love for humanity, grand in her zeal and courage…This…was the woman who had survived the savagery of the respectable Paris mob….she would die for the Cause”(Living my Life, p. 166). There’s a fascinating look at the artistic representation of the Paris Commune in Hyperallergic. \nL’Archive de Paris has several online exhibitions of ephemera and documents from the Paris Commune currently viewable. Also, an animated documentary film about the Paris Commune was recently created and broadcast for the sesquicentennial in France for Arte TV, Les Damnés de la Commune**.**\n📷\nFrom the EGPPHP office:\nWe at the Emma Goldman Papers Public History Project appreciate  your generous donations and continued belief in the value of our work.
