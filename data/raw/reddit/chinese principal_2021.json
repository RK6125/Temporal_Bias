    "text": "Any good crazy sub stories out there? I'm out on sick leave. I asked one of my inclusion teachers to give me a call today to make sure everything was okay, and she sorta paused after I asked and said, \"It was interesting.\" Given that \"interesting\" is a Chinese curse I asked for a bit of detail, and she said, \"Well, your sub was escorted from the building today.\" LOL. Apparently my sub had no idea what Zoom-based learned is, refused to let some of my students into the room because they're \"too big, they belong in high school,\" and, when my AP came to talk to her, she refused to open the door for him. So the principal came to talk to her... and she refused to let him in, either. \\*facepalm\\* I guess this means I'll be having a different substitute tomorrow. \n\nAnyone got any entertaining sub stories?",
