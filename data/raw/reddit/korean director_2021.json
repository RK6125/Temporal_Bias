    "text": "How do I respond to an offer to work in Korea for my company for 6 months? I work in the US as a Program Manager (Coordinator) for a Korean based Tier 1 supplier. I have only worked there for 4 months and I heard this week from my Launch Manager that I may be asked by our Korean Managing Director if I would be willing to go to Korea for 6 months. This would be to learn more about how the main Corporate office conducts launching new programs and about a particular product that is new to the North American Plant I work at. \n\nI understand that at 4 months on the job that this would be a considerable offer. I have no children and my Wife would be supportive. Sure, we'd missed each other. I imagine the pressure would be immense, but nothing more than I would place on myself. \n\nI never really considered this to be a possibility when looking at the broad scope of my career at the company.\n\nI have some questions I would like help with, but maybe there are some other questions I'm not asking myself.\n\nIs this opportunity too good to pass up?\nIs there a giant red flag I am missing?\n\nWhat should I expect them to provide? I assume that living expenses (Quarters, Food, Phone, & Transportation) would be paid by the company. I wouldn't want to leave something on the table (Compensation or time back home).\n\nAny advice or perspective would be welcome. I know this is all a \"What if\" scenario, but I want to be prepared for it and not make an uneducated decision if it happens. Thanks!",
