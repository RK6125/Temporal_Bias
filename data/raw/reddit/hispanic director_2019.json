    "text": "Need help with how to bring up issues about how a class is structured I'm on mobile so I apologize in advance for the formatting. \n\nI teach Spanish in a district in Metro-Atlanta. This is my second year as a teacher and I was given a class that everyone in my department avoids like the plague, Spanish for native speakers.\nIt used to be a fantastic high level world language class until demographics began to change. In the past the school would have a good amount of students with Hispanic/Latino cultures and backgrounds who were also fluent in Spanish. That has changed. We still have a good amount of latino students, but they don't necessarily speak any Spanish. These students operate at a level one or lower fluency, but are placed in the Native Speakers class because of their background and last name.\n\nI have a huge problem with this as not only does it seems discriminatory on the basis of race and national origin, but we are also doing a disservice to the students by placing them in a high level class they are destined to fail. Not only that, there could be students with non-lstino backgrounds who could be fluent in Spanish and they are not placed in the class because their last name doesn't fit the description. \n\nI have brought up my concerns to administration and they were dismissed by telling me I am supposed to differenttiate within the varied language proficiencies. Now I am a relatively new teacher, but as far as I know, differentiation is used to challenge or support students within the same level, not to teach 4 different levels within one 50 minute class period. The school has no real requirements for this class. No proficiency test. As long as your name is Hernández you are placed in this class without a say. I have been tasked to keep the Latino students isolated in this class for the entire year and then make a determination of what level they should go to afterwards.\nAdministration's reasoning for this behavior is that it would be unfair for a fluent Spanish speaker to be at the beginners level, but many of them are truly beginners.\nI have a French last name, by this logic, my kids would be enrolled in a francophone class with complete disadvantage.\nI've decided to bring this up to my World Language director in my district since my school refuses to appropriately place students in the correct level.\nWhat should I say? Has anyone had a similar experience?",

    "text": "I had to write my first report for my student. Hi Reddit. I’ve posted here before about this specific student. Probably 3 times in the last month.\n\nI am a first year kindergarten teacher at a low income Hispanic private school. Not a lot of recourses or support, unfortunately. We attract families who aren’t the most stable because of our flexibility and easy scholarships.\n\nI have a student who doesn’t come from a reliable family. He gets easily upset and gets physical. He throws chair, screams, and hits me. I’ve gotten a lot of support and advice from this sub and I’ve implemented them all. Emotion charts, feelings meter on their desks, visual timers, responsibilities chart, you name it.  Some days are good, some days bad.\n\nBut his bad days are intense and he still hits me. Kicking, punching, and pinching. He’s thrown chairs at me and students. \n\nThe staff there told me to write reports but I’ve been stubborn. I know if I do, they will eventually remove him and kick him out of the school. The only people that genuinely care about him is the school staff and me, his teacher. I want to help him. I want to make a difference.\n\nBut I finally had to write report. He got me good today in the stomach. I’m bruised. The director of the school is now cracking down on the family with warnings. He might get kicked out. I hate that I can’t do anything else. I hate that I’m getting frustrated with him. I hate that when he’s absent, I am a little relieved. I hate that even though I desperately want to be teacher that breaks through to him, having him removed wouldn’t be the worst thing. I feel like the opposite of what I wanted to be as a teacher. \n\nI believed I would always talk about feelings, be patient, and never have to touch the child. But it’s all gone out the window.  I have to pick him up sometimes from the ground, I don’t always have the chance to talk things through with him because he’s too upset, and I’m losing patience quicker. This isn’t fair to him. It’s not his fault. He just doesn’t understand his feelings and how to handle them. His family stinks. He must always feel miserable, trapped in his crappy emotions.\n\nI feel like a total failure. :- (",

    "text": "Black mothers are dying in childbirth 3-4x more than white mothers in the U.S. Hey all! I’m a producer for Empowered Health, a new podcast that is aiming to demystify women’s health.\n\nWe just put out the first episode of our two-part series on the maternal mortality crisis. Episode one explores how race plays a role in this crisis– it becomes clear our culture isn't doing enough to protect black mothers. Black women are three to four times more likely than non-Hispanic white women to die during childbirth. That’s even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, like education and income.\n\nAs more than one researcher said to us, the birthing crisis is the canary in the coal mine of women's health. It is a problem of women not being listened to, not being respected and being disempowered during a time in life when they should feel entitled to good care and a personal feeling of empowerment, feeling full of feminine power and purpose.\n\nDr. Neel Shah, the director of the Delivery Decisions Initiative at Ariadne Labs, breaks down how medical students are trained to be biased and how that contributes to this problem. Fatima Dainkeh of YWCABoston helps us understand actually talking to black mothers is a good place to start and that a day-long workshop on bias isn't going to cut it. Midwife Ebony Marcelle shares how she's shaped her care model to better serve African American mothers. And, Dr. Mary-Ann Etiebet, the executive director of Merck for Mothers, looks at the global initiative she heads working to integrating the voices of black women into maternal mortality and morbidity.  \nFigured this group might be interested in this episode, here's the link:  \n\n[https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/empowered-health/id1452440833?i=1000436048392](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/empowered-health/id1452440833?i=1000436048392)\n\n(links to other streaming platforms on our website www.empoweredhealthshow.com)",
