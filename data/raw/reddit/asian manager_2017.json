    "text": "Looking for opinions on a bold job application idea I'm going to be applying to [Rootastes](https://www.therootastes.com/) as their [Operations Team Lead](https://www.goodfoodjobs.com/jobs/104227/operation-team-lead), and am looking for some opinions on an idea I'm \nthinking about doing. The company is a curated lunch delivery service in Boston, focusing on healthy, sustainable, farm-to-table meals for corporate lunches. The job would oversee their kitchen operations, handle customer relations, receive inventory, supervise kitchen employees, and work with the founders on development and growth.\n\nI'm super in to cooking and lived in Thailand for several months (relevant because many of their dishes are Asian-inspired) and was thinking about dropping off a physical application... along with 4 homemade Thai-inspired salad bowl meals in compostable packaging. There are 4 core staff listed on their website, so that's why I chose 4 lunches. I make a pretty impressive salad bowl (greens, grains, tofu, veggies, dressing sauce) and am hoping it'll get me some attention.\n\nI was thinking that in my resume, I could talk about the reasons I chose each aspect of the bowl (not in too much detail, but e.g. choosing Barley as a grain because it is readily grown in North America, whereas most quinoa is imported from South America, thus having a higher carbon footprint; the packaging I chose, etc.). \n\nIn terms of how qualified I am for the job, I do have ample experience managing small teams, 1 year working in an actual restaurant, 2+ years experience in a customer service job, 1 season of farming experience, experience working with chefs to curate their veggie orders (part of my farming experience), and 1 year experience working for a small environmental non-profit (3-5 people). So I might not be the strongest candidate given the job description, but definitely do have some relevant experience and am SUPER passionate about sustainable food systems in urban settings. \n\nJust looking for some opinions on this idea - is it too presumptuous? Insight from hiring managers or co-founders of start-ups particularly appreciated. Thanks!",

    "text": "[California] Indian-American and I believe I am receiving discrimination at my workplace. Do I have any recourse? A year ago I got hired to a pretty diverse team. The original manager of the department was great and my work environment was okay. About 6 months ago our manager got replaced by a new manager; who I will call Bob. Everything seemed normal and Bob was professional with all of us. Gradually though I notice signs that I am on the receiving end of discrimination. \n\nOur department was originally a quarter Indian. My coworkers left for multiple reasons unrelated to Bob but none terminated. I noticed that Bob replaced them all with White or Eastern-Asian ultimately making me the only Indian in the team. \n\nThis made me suspect something but I brushed it off that it was a coincidence. About 2 months ago, I was not assigned to be a Project Lead after I finished a project that was leftover from my old manager. When we got more projects, Bob gave all of my coworkers some form of project lead position except for me. I was assigned purely as a supporter role. Our old workflow was that everyone was a lead for one project and was a supporter role for a different project. I was the only one that was overlooked for a Project Lead role. The replacements got Project Lead with one receiving two projects. I brought this up with Bob and he brushed it off with that he'd like someone purely concentrated on one role as a contingency; so far I am the only one that has one role. \n\nThe gossiper on my team made an off-remark of how my boss does not trust Indians. I concluded that this was the reason Bob chose not to hire Indians and passed me over. \n\nI requested a transfer to HR and told them that I suspected discrimination as my reason. HR denied my request because the branch did not allow transfers and my claims were \"unsubstantiated\". Apparently they interviewed the gossiper and he denied what he told me. Now everyone is keeping their distance from me. \n\nI would like to quit but reviewing my situation I have concluded that I cannot quit for at least a year. Its a combination of personal professional reasons. \n\nWhat are my options? I am lost on how to handle this.",

    "text": "How to find low competition job or how to choose career ? Hi all, my name is Tony and i am 25 yr old. I would like to share my experience in choosing career and picking jobs... \n\nI would like to ask you for career advice...  \n\nI dont know where to start so i will just write down what ever come to my mind...\n\nLike every teenager i had to choose path(career) for myself and work hard to make a living. I started in Video (DVD) store as general labour when i was 18. After that i moved to Australia because all of this \"good life articles\" etc.  \n\nI decided to start with building (construction) because it was fairly easy to get into and money was decent... I was planning to master one field in construction and to become professional...\n  \nI did not count on bullying, pain, long hours, and terrible working conditions, but i was like : \"Hey whatever in few years it will be beneficial if i stay here...\"  \n\nThen after 6-8 month`s i started realising that i would probably need 10 years in this industry to become Master... even than i would need to break my back in order to earn good money (Still you need to fight with customers, run for contactors to pay you the money that you already earn etc...)\n  \nSo i Quited, and i decided to become Security equipment installed, because i finished 4 years DC / low voltage electronic school in Europe (whatever i knew some basics etc...)\n\nI got job, and i started to learn about Alarms, Cameras, Access controls and many other electronic devices...  \n\nI can say that i was really good at it after 1 year, i was able to do solo installation, programming, troubleshooting etc...\n\nAfter that i realised that if you want to have decent money you would need to have your own company (vehicle, tools, customer base etc etc... and still you would have to chase new customers, keep old ones, and a lot more things in order to survive...)\n\nWhen i first started i saw ad`s such as \"75.000$ year, your own vehicle bla bla...\" i was thinking wtf this is gold mine...  \n\nIn reallity, to earn 75.000 you would need to work 7 days a week, and like 12 hours shifts, and to deal with crazy people, shty jobs, far away locations, + you would need at least 10+ years of experience...\n\nAll in all it was shty job, it`s not about how smart you are, its about how fast can you climb on ladders, or run cables on 10m heights, how good you are with hammer drill (not to mention, if you hit pipe or something you would have to pay all damage...)  \n\nSo i quited... Next thing i was get into was factory labour, becase i tough it`s secure job, not that much stress, little bit less money but why not ?!\n\nI manage to get job in factory with 23.5$/ hourly as product line labour... i was really happy (first day)...  \n\nThan i found out that you have to do 12-14 hours shifts with 300 asians ( NOTHING AGAINST ASIANS ) , they have to work 12-16 hours hard labour work in order to stay in country... so you have low chance to compete with them, and there is no room for any kind of complain...  \n\nI Asked my manager after 3-4 month of that shty job, is there any chance to work on promotion, like to become supervisor or something that is not HARD LABOUR 100%, (this job was lifting 10-30 KG constantly for 12 hours minimum, fast paced environment), and She told me yes, there is... Usually you need to work for the company for 5 years and to stay alive without injury or something... and than they can consider option to give you better position or something (for 2-3$ extra)...  \n\nLong story-short i quited after 6 month of that work...  \nI was desperate and almost suicidal because i was lost i had no idea what to do... Than i decided to get into programming because i used to do web development when i was 16-18...  \n\nSimply i started with JavaScript, PhP, Css etc... i decided that i am going to sacrifice 2 years of my life, on everyday learning...  \n\nI finished at least 10 books, 20 online courses from codeacademy, udemy, linda etc... I have like 30 personal websited, bunch of small codes, projects, small web apps, forums, social ETC...  \n\nSo i decided to do job hunt... I managed to find one company (12 yr old with a lot of clients etc.) , guy offered me position to work for free, and to get some experience even if i have 2+ years experience (+ fiver gigs, upwork freelance etc)...  \n\nI worked first 2 weeks for nothing and it was ok for me because i needed formal exp, than he offered me 200$ week 5/7 days, and that is WAY BEYOND MINIMUM WAGE, it`s 5$/hour in Australia...  \n\nMinimum Wage is 15.5$ even if you do most shty job...  \nAnyway i accepted... , after few more weeks i heard my boss talking about \"Overseas monkeys\", how they work for nothing etc...  \n\nSo yeah i quited..., and i tried with other ad`s...  \nProblem is in outsorcing, it`s hard to compete with Indians (NOTHING AGAINST INDIANS) , because they can work for 5$ whole day from India...  \n\nFor entry level jobs in Web - Dev, just check ads , you have to know : html,css/bootstrap/less/sass/js/frameworks/jquery/php/larver/other frameworks/wordpress/customisation/themes/React/Angular/Git/ and all kind of sht...  in order to get entry lvl job...  \n\nSo my 2 years of hardwork+learning = entry lvl job = FAIL\n\nTo be expert or at least fluent with all of these technology above you would need at least 3-4 years + work experience (that you probably wont get, how to find job with out exp... + industry) is already FULL of \"Web developers\" and other specialists...  \n\nAnyway i will continue with improvements and with learning new technologies and programming languages but not that intensive like i used to, because i lost faith about becoming web-dev.  \nReason is simple, How to risk 5-10yrs of your life, with constantly learning new tech, 12 hours of coding, fixing things etc... when you know that all your hard work can be outsorced (overseas) for 5$ etc... I dont know tbh it kinda sux... Not worth at all, it`s all because articles such as \"Web developers earning bunch of $$$\", \"top 10 jobs - #3 web design\", etc.... It`s double side coin but yeah i was naive ^^..  \n\nWell i decided to become \"smart\", and to do big re-search before i dive into new \"career\"... I wanted to do something with low competition, or something that is fairly easy to get into junior position roles. Only thing i wanted is job where you can improve your skills and progress, example: \"road from junior front end dev to Web master bla bla\"...  \n\nSo i saw article \"Nurse shortage in Australia\"...  \nnext ting i done is checking payscale: 65.000-110.000$ , i was :  \n\"Why not ?! , there will be blood but what ever, i like to help people, its decend career with oportunity to specialise latter on etc\"... To become nurse you can go Tafe 1.5 year , or Uni 3 years  \nand i saw info \"86% our students get job even before course ends\" bla bla... I was so happy, because i found something cool, that is worth doing(studying)...  \n\nI did some more research :), and i found out that there is no f***** nurse shortage in Australia, and that it`s only Goverment politics to get more immigrants for some reason i dont know why and i dont care...   Just i found out that out of 4000 new graduate nurses , only 20% are lucky to get job`s, and not the hospital ones... Those jobs are in rural areas, or age care homes far away from cities etc...  \n\nSo i was ohhh thx god i saw all this info, and read all this forum posts, because if i went 3 years to become Nurse (+i would have to work / study and to pay bills by myself etc. struggle) and to find out on the end that there is like 0.001% chance to find job, i dont know i would jump from bridge... \n\nThen i started to looking for something else ofc... and i was thinking, what is fairly BORING, and hard job that not much ppl want or like to do ?! It`s Networking (cyber security etc)... I know that a lot of ppl is passionate about that, and its actually very interesting field, but tbh for most ppl its boring, hard etc...  \nI decided to do re-search of that field...  \n\nLong story short: There is not enough networking job ad`s (in general, network admins, security, all-fields)  \nand existing ads in Australia (at least QLD,VIC) looking for 5+ years experience, list of things you need to know even for entry lvl job with 40.000-50.000$ (that ok money for me, but if you compare it with things/skills that you need to have under your belt this salary SUUUUUUUX)...  also market/industry going up and down, and even 10+ yr experienced guys have hard time to keep or to find new job...  (Tbh , WTF ?!)  \n\nSo i gave up on all those things, and i did google search on low competition jobs (in Australia), and only thing i managed to find is \"Mining jobs\" (I dont want to be rude or arrogant, but only dirty jobs...)  \n\nFinally... My question is: what i suppose to do ? I can become removalist or something like that, because my back will break before 35, and what to do than ? Same thing for coffe or barista... Everyone looking for young ppl, and everyone like femals over males, so it`s not career to get into really...  \n\nIs there some kind of certificate such as CCNA (cisco), or Nurse (diploma), that can really boost your % chances to get a job ?  \n\nAny idea, opinion, advice or anything else is more than welcome.\n\nThank you",

    "text": "Can I Rely On My Current Role / End of Probation Negotiation Methods? (Software Development / UK Based) Hi all,\n\nI am in the UK and work as an iOS developer in a small sized tech business (not a startup).\n\nI took the job as my first software dev job having worked in marketing, the job was offering 25-30k so i said 25k as i wanted the experience and opportunity to get into the industry.\n\nSince then ive found the job to be not exactly what was promised, im the sole iOS developer when i was told id have a team, the CEO/Line manager who hired me hasnt spoken to me since my first day nearly 2 months ago and stays in his office.\n\nThe company isnt really making much money but has chinese money backing it which keeps it afloat, the management are totally incompetent but are paid highly despite doing no work and some are known to do their own companies work on company time...\n\nI work on the codebase for the iOS app alone, no guidance, no checks, totally solo. However I have removed all the crashes, fixed the bugs, rolled out several new features, and am working on a major user requested feature currently which I hope to complete before the end of probation.\n\nMy thoughts are that im not sure the companies intention, would they likely keep me on as im the only dev for iOS? its not a core part of their business (they make other hardware and iOS is the remote for it), further to this if i am offered the role fully, i really wanted to negotiate more money for the risk of working there.\n\nBased on what ive achieved and how i am not part of a team as promised, i was hoping to at least get the 30k allocated to the role when i started, and ideally, push for 34k as i want to be getting 2k a month post tax.\n\nI am 26 and wanted to move out so the salary and job security are important for me to progress my life. However i wasn't sure how to handle negotiation post probation, how can i approach the salary and should i be looking for job prospects elsewhere if they say no? The CEO is asian and the business operates in a pretty asian style.\n\nI can provide any further background needed, ive tried to be thorough, i just want to make sure i approach this correctly to achieve what I want in the best method!\n\nAppreciate time and help on this matter.",

    "text": "The worst workplace ever I'm an 18 years old Asian girl currently working at a Bubble Tea store as a part time worker. The minimum hourly wage in Ontario is $11.40, but I only get $8 per hour (btw I got only $6.5 one year ago when I was being in a training period). Nonetheless, I still work there due to my broken English. \nEven so, there is only one worker working in the store majority of the time and two workers on the busy weekend. It is so ill-conceived for the workload. I often have to stay there extra half hour more for cleaning up and serving customers without getting paid. Sometimes, they even request me to be there earlier than I'm supposed to. They consider these as obligations and make me feel morally guilty if I refuse to.\nAs I mentioned above,there is only one worker majority of the time. I can't even have my meals properly. If there are customers, I have to give up eating and serve them. The thing pissing me off is that my manager would monitor how many time do I waste on eating my meals through closed-circuit television. She says it's morally unacceptable for workers spending more than 10 minutes on eating meals.\nI really want to quit the workplace!!!",

    "text": "Casual racism ***** EDIT: Wow, this post got significantly more attention than I expected. Thanks for all the advice and support (and zealous arguments about when stores should and should not allow more customers inside). I will be reporting this employee, mainly because while I do believe that there was wrong on both sides (but thanks to all of you who clearly offer amazing customer service), and I should just get over it, there is something to be said about speaking out about these matters, especially when prior generations have not. Who knows if it makes a difference, but it seems to at least have sparked some discussion here. I'm not going to insist on his firing or other retribution, if they would even do so in the first place; I can totally understand if this guy had a bad day and needed to take it out on someone. But the company should know if a branch allowed an employee to scream at a customer and did not address it immediately.\n\nObviously there's a lot of overt racism in the US, and it's been at a head for a long time now. There is every day violence committed against blacks and Muslims, and the statistics are there to prove it. I'm glad we talk about that. I hope that we can also talk about how comments about one's English or consumption of domestic animals is destructive too. No need to rank racism; it's all bad. For those who asked why saying \"ni hao\" is frustrating, rude, and yes, racist--I speak English. Why are those people assuming that I don't? *****\n\n\nI apologize beforehand if this isn't the right forum, but I need a place to vent, and this subreddit has always been one of the more open ones on this site. I went home this past weekend while studying for Step 1, and my dad offered to drive me back to my apartment as I don't live too far from school. He really wanted to stop by Sam's Club to pick up some fruit for me to take back, and even though I didn't think it was worth the effort, especially since it was nearing closing time, I said okay, because it's nice when your parents want to be nice to you, you know? We got to Sam's Club literally a minute before it closed, and my dad rushed inside while I parked. I decided to just wait for him outside the doors and was standing there when the guy who checks receipts called me inside and asked me if I was with the person who had just run in. He then proceeded to berate me for my dad coming in at closing time. (Edit: I did in fact tell him we were just getting one thing, in English, for those saying I shouldn't have just walked away. But no one has time to be yelled at once you're trying to be reasonable.) I walked away because no one has time to deal with that, and as I was walking away, he said, \"Maybe if I speak your language, ni hao ni hao, you’ll understand.\" I went to the cash registers and asked for the supervisor. When I told her what had happened and what this man had said, he ran up from the doors and started screaming in my face about how I was \"lying on [him].\" He continued to yell that I was lying (honestly if I were going to lie, I would have come up something slightly more creative). The manager said he was just trying to do his job.\n\nI was so frustrated and upset, and I continue to be despite sleeping on it. My dad does not want me to report this person because my dad is a good person and at about the zenith of non-confrontational, and he doesn't think this employee should be at risk for losing his job. But for me, not saying anything feels like implicitly condoning this behavior. Yes, we were in the wrong for entering this store at closing time--that one pack of strawberries better be the best I've ever had--but that didn’t justify outright racism and aggression. I don't know how many times I have heard \"ni hao\" as an insult/pick-up line/greeting and how many times I have been congratulated on not having an accent. I have been followed down the street and called a cunt because I told a stranger that addressing me with \"ni hao\" was impolite. I know this is something that people of color confront on a daily basis and that we are meant to speak out when it happens, but… it's hard, guys. Racism directed at Asians and Asian-Americans in particular seems like the last bastion of racism in comedy (see: Steve Harvey), the last and most insidious form of undercutting a whole group of people. It feels like no matter how hard I work, no matter how much I dedicate my professional (and whatever is left of my personal) life to trying to take care of people, how much my parents have sacrificed, that I can be leveled with the basest of insults.",

    "text": "In light of the #MeToo thing blowing up on social media, I decided to share my story which I've never fully known how to define and always felt guilty over.. Seeing #MeToo all over my social media today has been so exhausting. Since scrolling through so many of the same posts I've felt anxious, upset, and physically ill. Having the experiences of so many people thrust into my face has been incredibly overwhelming and just keeps reminding me of my own story, a story that I still to this day have not ever fully come to terms with. \n\n\nThe reason I still feel this way about my experience almost 3 years later is because I never knew how to define it. I never felt it was valid enough to call what happened to me sexual assault or \"rape\". I'm hoping that by sharing my story I can get some opinions from this community to try and help decipher what actually happened. I've never talked about it with anyone (the details anyway) and I'd like to just start by saying thank you to everyone who has even made it this far through my post. \n\n\nSo, about 2ish years ago I was going through a rough patch. \nMy parents and I have never gotten along (traditional Asian immigrant family/parent-child dynamic) and I have always been rather rebellious and angsty. We had moved away from Virginia (the 4th time I was having to transfer schools, this time in the middle of my sophomore year of high school) and I was particularly hating Maryland (where we moved to) and having an extremely hard time settling in and being happy where we were. My ex and I had broken up the summer before and all of the past year I had been going through what I call my \"tramp-age\" where I was just doing whatever and whoever I wanted without care or fear of judgement. Some might say my \"daddy issues\" are what pushed me to do it and I might agree, but really it was just the excitement that got me on the sugar daddy dating site Seeking Arrangement. \n\nFast forward to when the incident ocurred: I had met this 40 something man who had a 21 year old girlfriend. According to him, they were on the site because his girlfriend found sex to be too painful so basically he wanted someone he could get his rocks off with which apparently his girlfriend was okay with. The first time I hung out with them I spent the night at their apartment after getting drunk (I was 19 btw) and the boyfriend and I had sex while the girl watched/was in the room. Sex was meh, I wasn't particularly into it and eventually felt pretty sore and it was getting kind of painful. Thankfully he finished quickly though and everything was all good. It was just bad sex basically. The next morning when he walked me to my car he hands me $200 to thank me for my services I guess. $200! To me, that was a Lot of money at the time. A few weeks later, he hits me up again asking to hang out. I figure hey, they're cool people I get along with the girlfriend especially why not? Fast forward to when me and the guy are having sex later that night (I was drunk again) and the sex this time is incredibly painful. I'm not sure why really, but it literally felt like I was being rubbed raw. This went on for a long time. The entire sexual experience probably only lasted about an hour max but it seemed like it went on forever. I was whining, letting out painful moans, whimpering, but I never said stop or spoke up about how painful it was. I remember he was on top of me and my whole body was stiff as a board under him. I desperately tried to close my legs in a way so he couldn't penetrate me as deep or something but obviously nothing worked. At a couple points I would try to scooch away from him and he would keep pulling me back into him. I still never said anything, never said stop, never said no. It was like I had lost the ability to speak. It finally got to the point where he laid his whole body on me, pressing me into the bed with his entire weight in an effort to hold me still while he kept having sex with me. I was in so much pain and I could feel tears behind my eyes but I somehow managed to just let out a few pathetic whimpers while the rest of my body and mind just went numb. I remember desperately trying to just pretend like nothing was happening, like I was trying to send my mind somewhere else until he finished and it was over. He finally came and rolled off of me. We toweled off, both fell asleep, and then the next morning it was like nothing had happened between us. He acted normal as did I and again he handed me $200 as I left their apartment. I never spoke or heard from either him or his girlfriend again. For awhile I didn't think much about what happened at all. I thought of it just as a bad sexual experience until twice I was pinned down (once with my sexual partner while we were play fighting, and the second time at jiu jitsu practice) and I felt immediately triggered. I felt sick, like I was going to burst into tears, numb. And at first I didn't even realize why I felt that way! \n\n\nThis was almost 3 years ago now and to this day I've still never told anyone about what happened to me besides alluding that I had a bad experience/was assaulted. Since then I've had one other sexual encounter that was similar to what happened the first time but it wasn't nearly as bad. \n\nI just have a really hard time validating my experience. How can I recover or know that I've recovered when I don't even know what to call what happened to me? How do I know I've stopped being a victim when I don't even know whether I can call myself a victim to begin with? \n\nOver these last few years I've told myself that I'm \"over it\" and that it doesn't affect me, which is partially true. Most of the days I forget that it even happened to me. Today was not one of those days. I've felt incredibly guilty and ashamed and I don't even know why. I can't help but feel like I put myself into that situation, and for the longest time and even still, I have a hard time calling what happened to me \"rape\" or \"assault\". I just don't feel like what happened to me was \"as bad\" as what other victims have gone through. I really don't know how to feel about it. \n\n\nThank you all for reading/listening.",

    "text": "Female studying engineering with mental health issues, need some advice I've come to some cross roads in my life, and need some advice about what to next. (Sorry, it is quite long)\n\nHere's some background. I've completed a three year bachelor degree in engineering science and am now working on my masters in a specialist area in engineering. My long term goal was to always finish my masters and then work in industry. I got average marks in my undergrad and never really enjoyed university. The content was interesting, but I struggled keeping focus on class/study and had terrible time management problems. Was never a particularly happy individual with minimal friends but just accepted that to be my personality.  \n\nFast forward to one year into my masters. Pretty much have a nervous break down and diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Drop out of some units and scrap a pass in others. I attend class sporadically and spend days at a time not leaving my room. Finally psychologist figures out I have adhd and now on a waiting list to see a psychiatrist (which is $700 for the first appointment alone..). I'm miserable, alone, and generally hate my life. I should be graduating, instead I'm 5 units short of graduating and haven't written my thesis (which will take a year). It's not that the content is overly difficult, it's just that the drive I once had is gone and I'm sick of student life/study.\n\nI've got some interviews lined up in technology consulting for fairly reputable companies. The pay is good, but not as good as whats offered in the area of engineering I studied. Family is pushing me to finish my masters, saying I will regret my decision not to complete my masters in the future. \n\nBut aside from my mental heath issues,  being a female in engineering is hard. At the university I attend, my specialist area has roughly 5% females. Even though I'm from my countries dominant ethnicity (white), most of my class mates are asian/indian. I don't have a cultural support group like many others. I don't really know if I want to work in this industry any more, and be subjected to what I have been put though in university.

    "text": "Would anyone be willing to share their experience with an ARL program, especially in utah? Hi! I am from Utah, but I have worked in Japan the last 6 years (not teaching English) in Japan. Japan has been a good run for me but now I want to take my family and go back to Utah for a number of reasons. (Lower stress environment, better hours, but also I really love teaching.)\n\nMy father is a high school science teacher so I have always loved science and I have always kept myself very knowledgeable in science because I love it. But I don't have a degree in science nor do I have a teaching certificate. (My degree was Japanese Lang/Lit and Asian Studies)\n\nI am posting this here because I would really appreciate any information and experiences from anyone who has participated in an ARL (Alternative Routes to Licensure) program, especially in Utah.\n\nI especially think I am suited to be an earth sciences teacher and I am currently studying for the appropriate PRAXIS tests which I think I can easily pass after a few months of study.\nI could also easily teach a Japanese class, but I think there is no demand for that, and I would be much more excited about teaching Earth science anyway.\n\nUtah has a huge shortage of teachers, especially science teachers, so (as I gather) if you can get a good enough score on applicable PRAXIS tests you can get in an ARL program and become a teacher even if you don't have an applicable degree or teaching certificate.\n\nObviously living in Japan means I can't just walk on over to the BOA and get information easily. So I am trying to get as much information as I can now as I move forward trying to determine how and if I can manage this transition.\n\nLuckily, I can take PRAXIS tests here in Japan, so I am currently studying for those and hope to take one or two  before the end of the year as a sort of self-evaluation.\n\nI would be so greatful if someone out there who has gone through this sort of process would be willing to share their experiences with me.\n\nI am getting some information from my dad (who is a very successful chemistry teacher), but he mostly just says stuff like, \"I am *sure* you could do it. You are better than that bozo they hired last year. or \"You are so well suited to it.\" etc. But I really am having a hard time getting a good picture of how the overall flow of the system works, etc. The timeline of the whole process, when pay starts, how much support/training is offered, etc.\n\nThank you.",

I did a major in Asian Languages and Literature, and a minor in Computer Science.\n\nI was a summer/substitute janitor during high school, milk deliveryman for part of college, worked doing data entry the other part. After graduating I worked at a company for 3 years, starting out working in sales and becoming a production manager after 10 months (but I fucking hated that job/company.

I mean, I know I'm a great employee. I do my work on time, and always try my best. I've always been well liked and respected at my previous jobs.\n\nWhat I'm worried about is my skill set. I keep looking at open positions, especially in IT, and they all want certifications and skills I just don't have, nor do I have the money to go back to school and get.

Can anyone give me some advice where my experience is valuable?\n\n**tl;dr** teaching English abroad, know I will return home eventually, anxious about what I will do to find a job since I feel like I have no skills that are marketable and will never find work or own a home and I'm not even saving for retirement yet ohgodohgodohgodohgodohgod...............",

Working for an Asian owned company in the Bay Area (expensive). I was contacted by a recruiter asking if I was interested in an opportunity. I said I wasn't looking but it wouldn't hurt to go for the interview.\nI went to the interview with the mindset of \"nothing is gonna happen you're just doing this for the experience of going to an interview\" mind you, the interview is in the Central Valley of California. specifically [Modesto]. Anyways the interview ended up going really well and I actually kind of liked it. They sent me an offer letter the next morning.... stating they were still looking for candidates, but I was at the top of their list.\n[Project Manager Position] Base Salary only 5k more than what I'm making now, but offering additional 5k for relocation, monthly bonuses based off of company wide performance, and paid Overtime. the base salary wasn't enough for me to pull the trigger so I asked for 5k more... and that was like taking candy from a baby... They said \" for a candidate like you thats no problem at all...\" now that may not seem like much to some, but for a girl in her mid 20's trying to pay off her student loans and living in CA thats a good chunk. so overall the pay increase would be 10k (16% increase) + paid OT + monthly bonuses and 5k for relocation.\na little pre-story, I'm not from the Bay Area Originally, I'm from Michigan. I moved to CA for better job opportunity and the weather lol. I've been in the Bay Area for a little over a year and a half, and CA for over 3 years now.\nThe Bay Area is beautiful and I've made a good group of friends and really feel like I'm establishing myself. As far as the job itself goes, its a great opportunity for me for my career. Is the Move worth giving up everything? I hate to take personal items into factor, but is the opportunity greater than the crappy location? Do I let this opportunity go hoping something greater comes along somewhere down the line?",

    "text": "29, How do I transition from China focused sales to a different sector? I'm 29, American, about 4 years work experience.\n\nBachelors in Political Science, Masters in East Asian Studies, both from decent state schools, top 50. Grades were decent, 3.33 undergrad, 3.87 graduate, though they could have been better. Full time work and studies don't go so well together. All my academic studies were geopolitical and financial system focused, with an emphasis on China.\n\nAs part of the bachelor's and master's degrees, I spent 2 academic years in China. Then worked there in the education marketing field for a British company for another 2 years. From this, plus the academics, I speak fluent Mandarin, and have a strong understanding of Chinese culture.\n\nI came back to the US, and used my small savings to start a company. It had initial interest from some investors, which spurred me to really give it some serious thought, but the investments fell through and I poured my savings into it thinking if one investor showed interest, another must be interested as well. Didn't work out that way.\n\nAfter that folded, I spent 6 months or so scraping by and applying for jobs constantly, and fell bassackwards into a position. Initially I thought it was a short term consulting role where the owner of a small manufacturer in the Chicago region wanted me to accompany him as a \"spy\" on a business trip to China with him. Things sort of escalated quickly and I took a full time role as the China regional manager for this smallish company out in the boonies south of Chicago. I told him that this wasn't what I was looking to do longterm from the outset, and agreed to help him reform his businesses China operations. I spent one year doing this, found new dealers, renegotiated the contracts, fired the deadweight, stopped the dirt, redid the Chinese marketing materials, and hired on some long term talent to take over and trained them up.\n\nAfter one year, I shifted over to a part time position, as sort of an on call consultant, in addition to whatever else might be needed, because I was going to go back to school for economics. I did not, sadly, get accepted to the programs I applied for. I applied for \"Ivy League\" level European Universities, because I already have a master's degree, and I don't think it makes a lot of sense to get a second unless it comes with the networking potential of a top tier school. Thus I'm in a pickle. I have a year before the next intake for schools, with no guarantee again that I would even get in. I have rent to pay, and zero interest in continuing in my current job.\n\nI've been doing China, nearly exclusively, for almost 10 years now, and I need to branch out. It's lost it's allure, I don't enjoy it. I want to get into financial consulting, or management consulting or geopolitical analysis, or even journalism, something that is more generalized. I don't have anything against doing something that involves China in some way, but I do not want to do it exclusively anymore. I've been applying for Business Analyst, Financial Consultant, Global Strategy Analyst, Risk Analyst these types of positions, through LinkedIn in the Chicago area for many months now. I haven't had any responses though, can't seem to get through the HR filter. The only interview I had was in October, for an exclusively China focused position in Washington, for $43k a year which I didn't take. I'm not sure where to go from here...",

The tech part itself I have no interest in persuing, although I do like programming a lot. I've never completed any certification or education in it.I never tried to have a career in IT because I didn't want to, as a result my CV is filled with lies and omissions covering my lack of any specific skill and months and years of unemployment. I've been fired more times than I'd like to admit. Still I got hired again, I'd say because of my charm, intelligence and social skills. I used to work hard but nowadays only so far as to barely make the targets, I can't do it anymore.\nAt my current job (started 3 weeks ago) I'm anxious about being fired again (they already demoted me to a less demanding position), I keep myself calm and together, but it's a struggle while knowing my coworkers question my abilities. I try my best to learn all I can, but it doesn't seem enough to convince them.\n\nThe main issue is that I've been lying to myself for years, I've been ignoring my ARTISTIC calling. I'm a very talented photographer, painter and draftsman, but it's been hammered into me by my asian parents that... well you know the story. My ideal vision of myself is as a public figure who's a performer/artist/intellectual that people turn to for guidance and artistic inspiration. Ideally I'd live from my Art and change the world with my vision and spiritual message. The thing that keeps me going every day is my continuing exploration of my psyche, improving the things I don't like about myself and doing the things I like most (drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, playing guitar, building websites) it fills me with sense of accomplishment like nothing else. I can't see myself wasting away for the rest of my life in an office just to pay off a mortgage and support a family (don't have one fortunately).\n\nSo my passion is ART, to pay for my bills with something I actually like to do I've already been delving into webdevelopment (creativity + IT combined) for few years now but it's very hard work. I guess I like the IDEA of being a developer with good salary and working abroad on interesting projects, but the path to it is very long and demanding so I procrastinate a lot. I also fail romantically (no steady gf for a few years now) which worsens the anxiety I feel about my life, women my age don't like men who don't have a clear path in life or bitch about their current job too much. My finances are worse, being unemployed for weeks or months while jobhunting for a job I don't want to do but have to pay my growing bills, somehow I still manage and not starve. I don't want to live like this anymore !.  I need some fresh ideas, guidance, support, anything!",

    "text": "Should I report about racial stereotypes that go too far? Please i need advice? Hello cscareerquestions. Longtime lurker and finally made an account to complain about my possibly shitty situation. I just want readers to keep in mind and tell me in the end if I’m overreacting or am I actually being mistreated. I really want to believe I’m overreacting and I feel like I’m going crazy over this. \n\nTL:DR: I’m currently facing some less innocent stereotype jokes by an employee and I don’t know whether or not I should let it go or not.\n\nSo I work in an IT department that has a software team under a Canadian (Toronto area) company that does research. I am myself a young male Canadian-born Chinese who recently started my career as a software developer. Most of the stereotypes I’ve witnessed upon myself are very innocent and I play along and genuinely laugh. However, I have this one senior lead (who is White and from a commonwealth country other than Canada) and overall he’s a great guy and a great leader. He sometimes likes to use stereotypes a bit too much. A good amount of them time are innocent and I’ll play along or just not respond at all if they’re a bit more on the offensive (ex. Looking at a bunch of resumes and seeing a common last name like ‘Patel’ and saying hey that’s (another employee’s) brother)\n\nHowever, this one thing really got under my skin and prompted me to come here looking for advice. He wanted to know my “real” name and was being very persistent. I politely told him my parents gave me my western name first but it wasn’t enough for him. He even went to get other people to nag me about it who thankfully didn’t want to participate. He proceeded to try hard to annunciate his wife’s (who is also a Canadian born Chinese) and laughed. He’s a pescatarian who loves animals and loves to comment on a lot of the times when I’m eating something with meat and has also made some comments about me being a meat eater and being Asian. I feel like his wife just lets him have free reign on stereotypes but he should know not to have the same amicability to everyone else. That is probably what plays a huge part in his own mind that he can use Chinese stereotypes so frequently. My perception of him now makes me think he likes to make everything about my culture a joke and has somewhat of a superiority complex over i\n\nI really want to keep this job and has great benefits and a great pension and the other people I work with are just splendid. However, my contract ends in August with a chance to go on Full time with the benefits after that. My manager (who is also white) is a great teacher and mentor to me and the only thing he has ever asked me about my background is ‘What is your ethnicity’. My manager and I really get along and he knows I do a good job.\n\n However, I don’t know whether if I should make a complaint about this senior lead to my manager because what if he sees this as a nuisance to deal with a workplace problem that is related to racial sensitivity? The senior lead and manager are close professionally but not sure personally so I don’t know how to approach this. All I can think about is that if I make this complaint, am I going to be looked at as a problem? What if letting me go after my contract is the easier thing to do because I made this complaint? Does this also make me look bad if I’m trying to apply for another job and I say I complained about because of racial discrimination?\n\nSorry for the long post!",

    "text": "Career path for non-technical QA? Hi all, this is my first time posting in this sub, sorry if there are any formatting issues,\n\n\n#Backstory\n\n\nI'm a engineering graduate that happened to stumble into the QA industry a couple of years ago. I had basically no programming experience when studying my major (yes, my major happened to be one of those rare engineering stream where programming skills aren't really needed), aside from extremely simple VB.NET (think 'Hello World') as an elective.\n\nMy first job as QA was a manual tester in a small software vendor firm. Although the title was manual tester, I basically had to study specs and write my own test cases. The job involved mainly front-end testing dealing with clients, with occasional back-end testing using SQL to check DB values and entries (via simple SQL scripts).\n\nI currently work for the Asian branch of a pretty big international solutions provider. Job details here are more diverse and challenging:\n\n+ Take on as test lead in rotation with others for implementation of new product features (i.e. draft test plans and test cases)\n+ Communicate with other teams (PM, dev) to discuss deployment/roadmaps/timelines and corresponding feasibility\n+ Scheduling of manpower and resources for upcoming sprints (our company adopts some aspects of Agile)\n+ Identifying and proposing issues in overall software development workflow for improvements, but more emphasis on QA internal processes\n+ Manual test execution for front-end (client) and back-end (server) testing\n\nA bit about my current company and the working situation: the company started out with ~30ish employees, and has now grown to double the size thanks to booming revenues from Asian markets. QA head count, unfortunately, has been told will not increase accordingly. With increasing demand for faster response to market, our team is now facing a steadily increasing number of features under tighter deadlines. The fact that our products support desktop and mobile platforms does not help either. Even simple mobile device compatibility checking itself is a daunting task due to the variety of device/browser combinations out there on the market, with many more to come.\n\nStarting next month it's performance review, and my manager pulled me over early couple of days ago for a \"pre-meeting\". Basically he asked me what I felt I could learn or improve on (e.g. \"Any goals to improve yourself on?\"), and with a subtle hint that if I continue my performance in addition to these new skills/improvements that I might suggest, I could be a good candidate for a future promotion. I told him to give me a couple of days to think about these goals.\n\nIn private I have been trying to pickup programming (to prepare for automated testing), self-learning python from resources online. Unfortunately due to family commitments I can only reserve 3 - 4 hours per weekend to study. I personally doubt I can be sufficiently good in programming to be of any use at work. My company now already has a dedicated automation team to start developing frameworks and tools for us (especially to help with mobile device testing).\n\n#Question\n\n1. Coming from a non-technical background and history as a manual tester, what are some viable career paths in the QA domain that I could pursue? If any, what are some of the skills that I should pickup (which I'm lacking) or improve on? Please take into consideration that programming isn't something I'm good at.\n\n2. I do plan on leaving Asia and return to Canada in the future, are there any trends in QA for North America that is not yet evident in Asia that I should be aware of?\n\n3. I have yet to encounter any QA that is over the age of 45. Is this field something that prefers younger employees? If I want to continue pursuing a path in this field, is it possible to work until I retire?\n\nThat's all the questions I have for now, would appreciate any feedback. Thanks.",

    "text": "Are you stuck in accounting? Don't give up hope! Hey everyone, someone told me that I should share my story since it's quite unique. \n\nBackground: I'm 23, I'm Asian (yes minority classifications affect jobs), I graduated 2 years ago from a large state university with a degree in accountancy.\n\n I worked for almost 1 year as an auditor, 1 year as a advisory consultant, and now I just got an offer at an amazing consulting firm with a hefty pay raise and am making more than my audit senior did during his 5th year. My job is stable, I work half as much as an auditor at times, and I get more recognition.\n\nI entered the work force working in auditing. My job was very dull and tedious, and I hated it. It's just not the right thing for me. I know a lot of you love accounting, especially considering that I'm in the accounting subreddit, but I wanted something that was stable, had more income, had more flexibility, and was more fulfilling overall. \n\nI joined a Big 4 firm, and my office was not small. There were 50+ people in my start class for auditing. And in just 10 months, I transferred. \n\n---------\n\n**How I transferred**\n\nI didn't come in guns ablaze to HR or even my audit team. I didn't talk anyone to in audit. I approached a senior in my office's consulting team. I asked him about teams that had a need - a slot to fill. I got names - managers, directors, partners. I emailed every one of them and scheduled an interview/discussion. And I spoke with 5 people - a manager, two directors, a partner, and the senior. \n\nI asked them for a need. I promised I'd get my CPA (I did). I told them that I wanted to join. They were interested. They said they'll be glad to have me. It's so much easier when they're people in your firm. \n\nI talked to HR. HR contacted the partner, and the partner made it happen. I told my audit team, gave them 2 weeks notice. They didn't want to lose a cog-in-the-system associate, but they can't say no to a partner. Plus, I wanted to leave - it would benefit them to let me go. Keeping me would be even more detrimental, especially if I lost the motivation to do good work. \n\nThe switch happened within just 2 months. It was a bit dull, but overall amazing. I didn't get a pay raise. It was just advisory. I'm still called a consultant, but it was just advisory. Nonetheless, it began my journey into a new field of business.\n\n---------\n\n**How advisory worked for me**\n\nAdvisory was significantly better than audit. Most big 4's (and most other advisory wings) require the same thing: 40 hours a week with around extra time put into other works like proposals and development. Overall, it averaged about 45 hours per week. However, flexibility was far higher than audit. \n\nEvery consultant in the entire wing had at least one work-from-home day. It was also very common for people to request multiple WFH days during the week, so typically it's 2 days working from home. It was great, commute time was saved, and I felt far more comfortable. And no one expects you to be a machine at home either. \n\nMore importantly, I learned more - got more client exposure, got more deliverable/presentation experience, and became so much better at being a professional. Just by merely asking, I got put into almost-senior roles. And I was just a measly second year here. \n\n----------\n\n**The next offer** \n\nI thought I could do better. Plus I have a foot in the door of the consulting world now. But I also didn't want to work my ass off. MBB firms work you 60-90 hours a week. That's too much. I value my free time a LOT. \n\nI got an offer for another firm. Same work. More pay. Flexible. Acting senior role. Next year my pay will go up by 20% again. I'll be close to six figures, after just 3 years out of college. \n\n------------\n\nThese things might work for you. Or it might not. But one thing I have learned after all this: there are *always* opportunities and there's *always* a way into something better. You can get what you want as long as you make the connections and work for it. And no, I am not someone with a ton of connections that can get me in the door anywhere. I made those connections by just emailing people out of the blue. Start within your firm. Work your way out. Don't let nonresponses drag you down. If you're like me and hate audit, you can get out, and be far better off in every aspect.",

    "text": "When's a good time to quit? And HOW do I go about it? [I Just joined B4 as an audit associate(1 month) Finally got an offer from another industry which I'm genuinely passionate about.] Backstory - made a decision to pursue a field in the tech industry in final 6 months of Uni. Spent 'grad trip' summer months interning in said field, didn't get an offer from that company (headcount issues) in time I.e before I ended the internship. Pressure from family to join audit/get a job (had the audit offer before graduating) even though I wanted to take a break and study/pursue my own shit, caved because of incessant pressure, but secretly pursued all other avenues whilst coasting at Audit. Now unsure of whether to quit at the end of the second month (oct) or do it later (rental place only avail end of oct, and I wanna have my own place to escape family shouting/guilt tripping when they find out I left B4)\n\nIssues at hand: \n- busy season is starting next week in October and I don't wanna OT for a shit job when I have my \"dream\" job waiting (it's not perfect, but I'm elated w the opportunity)\n\n- place I rented only available end of Oct - decided to move out of my fam's place so I can pursue my shit in peace (Asian here, living w parents is not unusual, moving)\n\n- have a month Long engagement plotted for Whole of nov where I'm the only associate \n\n- if I hand in my resignation end oct/start of nov, will they sign off on it? (I've heard that partners might not process your resignation if they're understaffed- is this true?)\n\n- how does one resign? What questions do the higher ups ask? how honest should I be?what should I expect (from colleagues/bosses/managers) during and after resigning?",

    "text": "Never Tolerate Disrespect Just Because She’s Powerful Several years ago, I was subjected to a level of disrespect from a fellow human being that I refused to let go unpunished. At the time, I was at a company weekend getaway that was held in a lavish resort. It was a glorified piss-up, and all expenses were paid by the corporate managers. On the second night the bar closed early, so we decided to go off in different groups throughout the resort, have more drinks, and enjoy the night. In the spirit of getting to know fellow members of the company from other branches, I went off to different groups and spent time with them. I was treated with respect by many of my fellow workers, and it turned out to be a great opportunity for networking. However, upon introducing myself to one group, I was treated with utter disrespect by one of the National Managers. She was a small Asian woman who was high on God-knows what, and drunk off her face. After I walked in and introduced myself to the others, she started screaming at me like an unstable maniac:\n\n\n\n\n“Who the fuck are you? Guys, seriously who the fuck is that in our room?! I’ve never seen him before – why the fuck is he looking at me? WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?!!” she then screamed in an utterly abusive tone. One of the guys came up to me and apologetically suggested that I leave; explaining that she had had too much to drink. I was very disappointed that I didn’t get to meet more of my co-workers, and also that a National Manager had treated me in such a way. I refused to let this go down without a fight. \n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday I approached my boss and told her what had happened. She was outraged, and suggested that I make a formal complaint. The next day, I met up with the Deputy CEO and the General Manager of the company. I had no hope. Both of them were women, and they were on excellent terms with the National Manager who had abused me. According to them, the National Manager had a “natural charm”, and was “a lovely person” normally. Still, they got this unstable woman with a psychology degree to give me a call to apologize; which turned out to be very forced. I told that her that her behaviour had been unacceptable, and that the reason I had made a formal complaint was that I had been treated in such a way by a National Manager of all people. \n\n\n\n\nThree months later, I was out of the company, and the National Manager had been promoted.",

    "text": "Question / Idea for American feminists in the \"Women in Tech\" movement This question is mostly directed at American feminists, since in other countries, lack of representation of women in tech seems not to be as dramatic.\n\nI work in Silicon Valley, at a tech company, and the majority of my co-workers are of South Asian or East Asian descent. I would say about 75% of my co-workers are men, and 25% are women. Of the women, virtually 100% are of South Asian or East Asian descent (for the men, 80% are of South Asian or East Asian descent). Most of the men and women I work with are immigrants here in America on H1B visas (a controversial topic in its own right - which I won't bother debating here). FWIW, I was raised in the US, am a US citizen.\n\nIf the goal is to increase representation of women in tech,wouldn't the easiest way be to require a certain quota of H1B visas be allocated to women only? On my team, I have hired both men and women on H1Bs, and on average, I see absolutely no difference in their talent and abilities. I do, however, notice that I only ever seem to receive resumes from female engineers who are immigrants from East or South Asia, the majority of them on H1Bs.\n\nThe process of \"competing\" for one of the limited H1B visas is a difficult and arduous one for the technical talent that comes to this country. Often times, talented women engineers from other countries cannot get these visas. Wouldn't the most efficient way to increase the representation of women in tech be to require a high proportion of the H1Bs that are granted to foreign tech talent be given to women only? Is this something feminists should advocate for as an efficient way to improve the women in tech problems? If there was a requirement that H1B visas can only be given to women, there would be a large influx of female tech talent to this country, and technical roles in my company would almost immediately be at least 60% women.\n\nAsking as a curious manager at a Silicon Valley tech company who has hired and worked with many (90%+ foreign born) men and women, and has seen no difference in technical competence between the two genders.",
