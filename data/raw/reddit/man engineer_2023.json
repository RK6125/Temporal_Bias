    "text": "Has anyone been hired this year? I applied to a solid 500 places in my city, I got 2 on-site interviews followed by 2 no-thank you's. So get this... Man I can feel the burn this time. My inbox and LinkedIn are empty, I don't even get any spam job emails/calls from dangerous sites or questionable companies/people anymore. \n\nCompany A's on-site interview was FOR 2 DAYS, 6 HOURS EACH! I didn't even meet the VP or CEO or anyone from higher-up. They kept repeating same questions like a weird interrogation skit. I was low on sugar and shaking at the end of it. Company B's on-site interview started late, everyone was late, at least they bought me a sandwich, but everyone asked about my life background, my opinions on COVID and if I believe in it (WTF!?), if I had kids, if I was married, and since everyone was male, would it be awkward to work as a female engineer (I've been working as a 'female engineer' for 10 years so f-off lady')!? I swallowed my pride and just answered everything professionally because the pay was good! (And I didn't want to 'stand out' by answering MY way) And still they said no....huh interesting. Also, how low should I stoop here bro?   \nThis is my perspective- the jobs I'd applied to and attended the on-site interviews to, were SPOT ON to what my experience is and more. The only thing I can think of is, they are hiring people who seek lower pay. I think the reason why the job roles I'd applied to were suddenly cancelled, or the hiring manager was suddenly on PTO, or the job role was selected internally, was definitely about pay. (Apart from the financial restructuring BS excuse that companies are spewing these days).\n\nIn CA, there's a new law that made it mandatory for companies to display the pay range for a role. I usually hit the mid-point amount and tell the recruiter I'll negotiate as per my experience and job responsibilities, never hitting the max point, which is fair! Even though I nailed the interview, technical questions and behavioral, I was still not considered PROBABLY because they want to hire someone for a lower pay range. I can't think of anything else here really- I'm down to know your theories. \n\nIf this is true (I don't know about other states in the US) then we're in for a whole lotta immature, unprofessional fuckeryness that this hiring market is turning out to be.   \nGood luck everyone <3. Keep BSing\n\n&#x200B;",

    "text": "Former employer I quit working for to take a new job told a background check investigator I was “terminated” due to a policy violation when I was never told I was fired at any point in time before or after leaving. During a new job security clearance, a former employer that I did Independent Contracting for for 1 week told the investigator I was “terminated” with the reason “violation of company policy”. I had quit the job already and told them ahead of time when I would have to quit before accepting any work, and did exactly as I said. \n\nI agreed to work a labor job under a 1099 until I was offered an engineering job (due to recently graduating with an engineering degree). I told them this before ever accepting any work. I signed 0 documents, it was all verbal. 1 week in I got an unexpected job offer and took it. I told them when I got the offer and that I was leaving, just as I said originally. Fast forward several weeks, and I get a notice that my background check showed I was “terminated”. They never said I was fired at any point in time. They have my info to contact me. Then they listed the reason: “Violation of company policy”. I was never told or shown any company policies, but I always did my job right and never once was told I was breaking or had broken any policies. \n\nThis now contradicts the information I submitted saying I have never been fired from a job due to breaking any rules, etc. Is this a clear case of Defamation if it is provable that none of the above ever happened and that the false/misleading information has hurt my chances at securing my next job?\n\nIt seems to me the middle man who hired me on gave misleading information to the boss to make himself look better. The guy was a friend of mine, and has since been irresponsive to any texts or me reaching out. I then find this out today and it seems like it all adds up.\n\nAny advice?",

As someone who likes making music and edit videos, Im starting to lose most of my energy and time at work. Don't get me wrong, my workload is way easier than most engineering jobs, but man I do wish for some job that will leave me some energy to be able to do my hobbies and recreational past times. I'm also realizing that I miss college holiday periods that can last up to a month. How do you guys cope with this feeling and what do you guys do to balance between your hobbies and work without steressing yourself? I work an 8-5 with a 1 hour break everyday, That only leaves me around 2-3 hours of free time before I force myself to go to bed to have a good 6-8 hours of sleep, otherwise my day would be really drowsy.

    "text": "I have a college degree in a field where no body else has one and I can’t hold a job should I switch fields? I went to a trade school. All my brothers, including me, were forced to get college degrees or be kicked out by my dad after high school. After seeing how my brother's associate's degree played out, with him never moving out, smoking cigarettes all day, and becoming mentally ill, I decided that if I had to get a degree, it would be something that would make me money. So, I waited and ignored my dad's pleas to go to college for a while. When I was finally ready, I asked the counselor at the trade school, \"What degree do you offer with the most job opportunities?\" Two years later, I have an Associate's degree in electrical automation technology. It's been one year since I graduated, and I've worked with three different companies. The first one didn't utilize what I learned, so I left to explore other options. But the other two are the ones I want to talk about - maintenance technician jobs. A maintenance technician fixes machines after breakdowns. Let me be clear - it's not the job I can't stand, it's the people I work with that make me incredibly uncomfortable and hate my life. I was fired from my last job for asking too many questions. I don't know if I'm the problem or if it's the way people see me. Being fresh out of school, making $30 an hour, and working with people who never went to college makes me feel like I have a target on my back with nobody to help me.\n\n       Some examples of things I've been through and have been told by coworkers are: \"You make too much money,\" \"College ain't shit,\" being expected to be 30 minutes early by the people I work with, being considered late even if nobody tells you about this secret tardiness rule. One time, a mechanic finished a job with the maintenance team lead and immediately pointed at me, saying, \"I'm worth about 3 of him.\" I'm constantly compared to the new trainee by the same guy, who tells me he likes him better. During a conversation about people not showing up to jobs, he said, \"I wish you would've done that.\" I'm told I ask too many questions, not enough questions, and I have to listen to random rants about how college doesn't teach anything and how much smarter he is than me and most college students. This was just one guy at my last job, but I've experienced this kind of treatment in some form at every job I've had. Is this just how this field is? I'm scared. My parents invested so much money in my degree, and I want it to be worth it to them, but I don't want to be fired again. Last time, they said it was because I asked too many questions, but it was for a job where I was the only maintenance tech for the entire factory. I couldn't help but ask as many questions as possible. At the end of the 3-month probationary period, I was fired. The time before that, I got a lockout tagout violation for giving my key to an engineer to unlock something for me, and management made it clear to me that I had to resign. \n\n    I've dealt with similar attitudes at my previous job too. I only have 3 jobs on my resume since graduation, all with 3-month stays. Should I switch fields? Some classmates got engineering jobs with a two-year degree. Is it worth trying? Are engineering jobs any better? I've considered getting a class A license and becoming a truck driver until the right opportunity comes up. I can't risk going back to the same field unless I know I can stay. Wish I had applied for the ibew instead of college. I'm 24, living with my parents, feeling lost. Can anyone relate? Should I switch fields? Is this not the right field for me?\n\nRewritten with paragraphs and proper grammar. (:\n\nEdit: the fact that me even bringing up my degree made so many of you label me as snob kind of proves my entire point that what I experienced was some sort of hatred from people that don’t have degrees that a lot of young people must experience when they first leave school and get into the field. I never once said I was better or smarter for having the education some of you came onto this post assuming I thought that and it triggered some dark insecurities. Similar to what I experienced from this man I describe in this post. \nRead the damn post.\nLearn not to generalize.\nAnd more importantly than all stop shitting on vulnerable college grads lmao\nWe all just want to work and most of us only went to college because we were told to.",

    "text": "I don't know how to search for jobs I want to preface this by saying I feel extremely stupid asking this so please be kind...\n\nHow do you find a job, when you don't know job titles/position names?\n\n Let me explain... I am 26 and work in a call center. This is the only job I've had besides retail or restaurants. I've been here almost 4 years. I started as a Tier 1 agent taking phone calls. I am now a Tier 2 tech agent agent handling escalated cases. Basically  the middle man between the customers and our engineering team. I change things on accounts in salesforce, troubleshoot with customers, implement a few API fixes, and mostly create JIRA tickets for our engineers. I have been in this role for 2.5 years. \n\nI desperately want a new job. There is a lot going down hill here and I need to get out. I dont make great money, my morale is crushed, and most importantly I hate talking to customers. No new positions have opened in a long time so I'm starting to think I'm at a dead end at this company. Originally, I was hopeful that an internal position would open that I could shift into, but its been a year since anything outaide the support org has opened (besides engineering roles i am not qualified for). The only way to move out of support is to get a new job elsewhere, I think. \n\nNow here is where my problem lies. I literally don't know what kind of job to search for or what I want to do. I want holidays off. I don't want to work weekends. I especially don't want to talk to customers ever again. I've tried to google this and it's not helpful. I feel like I dont know how to search for jobs when I don't even know what I'm looking for. \n\nWhat kind of positions can I look for to get into a classic 9-5 (or similar) role that involves not talking to customers, and is fairly entry level? Or how do I learn to search for jobs? \n\nI have a bachelors in psychology. I'm starting grad school soon with end goal of being a social worker or therapist, I'd even be happy in HR. But in the meantime I want a job I can make okay money at and be happy. I currently make 57k a year and cannot drop below that. I also live in Alaska so remote work is the best option for me, and how I currently work.\n\nI am starting to think my only option might be tech support at a different company that has more room for growth so I could apply for a different position after being there for a while, but I am scared of being stuck at another dead end.",

According to the  email the company sent me, they told me it would be an open event so all I need to do is come with my CV and I should be interviewed on the spot. \n\nI would like to know how I should structure my CV so that I dont come off as being over qualified? If I remove all my SE jobs then **only my name, phone number and educational degrees will remain. Would that be ok? Or will they be curious why a 37 year old man has nothing to show on his CV?** \n\nAlternatively I can reduce my experience, from 10 to maybe 5 years and remove jobs from 5 years back.   \n\n\nI am inclined to do the latter, but want some advice on what would be the best way to approach this. \n\nAny advice would be helpful.  \n\n\nTIA  \n\n\nP.S in case any one is wondering; I have been rejected multiple times in SE jobs and now dont have any savings to justify waiting around for some miracle to happen.

    "text": "Is it common for younger workers to get exploited? I believe I'm being exploited due to my young age. To begin, I'm a man in my early twenties who has a master's in engineering. I'm engaged but not married yet. A year ago, I was hired at a small family-owned construction company (I am unrelated) where I'm by far the youngest member. Now, here's my issue: I find myself consistently assigned to tasks that are clearly not within my job description and are almost always menial. For example, my boss constantly sends me to get him coffee and lunch while in the middle of work, the senior technician sends me to buy cigarettes, I've been tasked with maintaining the company garden since it serves as our break area, I've even been sent to change a few roof tiles after a storm, I had to climb the water tower to check a frozen pipe, etc. While I still perform my engineering duties, these situations keep arising.\n\nMoreover, this company lacks a clear in-person hierarchy since most employees have worked together for over 30 years. This has created a problem for me as I often feel like I'm everybody's subordinate. I also feel like I have little influence over the projects we undertake, but when my older colleagues propose literally the same ideas, they get praised. I brought this up to the senior engineer after one idea in particular was ignored, and he just said \"Yeah, it's just that we have been doing things a certain way for years. Don't worry, everyone goes through the green phase. In a few years, you'll be done cooking and then you could bring some valuable input into all of this\". Ngl, that kind of hurt but okay. \n\nAdditionally, when there are unexpected overtime hours or company volunteers for community work (like cleaning up after a storm, placing protective gravel, or removing trees), I'm consistently the one assigned to these tasks. I did bring up my concerns with the HR department, but they didn't seem to take it seriously. For instance, for the roof and the water tower situation, they just said that our maintenance guy has a bad back so he needs help sometimes. They also said that sometimes newer workers (I have been here almost a year and a half) can be given various jobs. They also said that sometimes technicians can haze, but that that is just part of being the new guy so I should not take it to heart. So, I approached my boss and explained that I've been working more overtime than initially agreed upon and doing stuff that is not within my contract (as my contract is nearing its end and I have a backup job so this was my last attempt). His response was, \"Why can't you do overtime? It's not like you have a wife and kids at home. What else are you doing with your time that's so important?\". \n\nGiven these circumstances, I'm seriously considering leaving soon, as I believe I'm being taken advantage of because of my age. Still, I don't know if this is something that is common or if this is just this place.",

I thought I would share my list that details why it didn’t work out with you all. I would love to hear about other women’s experiences with this too, keen to know how universal my experiences might be!  \n\n1. Homeless (by choice)\n2. Chronic physical and mental health problems that were ongoing and untreated\n3. Enjoyed Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson \n4. Struggled with alcohol use (20-30 drinks a week to cope with work stress) \n5. Spent the entire date negging me (actually kind of impressive how long he did this)\n6. Nice guy but very avoidant/emotionally unavailable. Would probably have stayed in a situationship with me forever if I didn’t break it off. \n7. Completely misleading photos, looked like a different person in real life \n8. Very low self esteem, cried on the date, had recently broken up with his long term girlfriend (who he still lived with). Still tried to invite me back to his house to have sex with him. \n9. Lied about his name (twice) and age. Anti-vax, made lots of jokes about women being bad drivers, etc. \n10. couldn’t have a conversation to save his life. Had no opinions on anything and would repeat whatever you said. High levels of anxiety, saw this guy a few times before calling it. \n11. Pictures were very misleading. Spent most of the date talking about his special interests. \n12. Arrogant and entitled. Spent most of the date disagreeing with anything I said (e.g., even explained why my favourite food was a bad choice)\n13. nice guy but not very intelligent (e.g., had to define words like “maternal” and explain that white people could also have naturally curly hair). Ended up being too difficult to have conversations with him because of the amount of explaining that was required. \n14. Arrogant. Didn’t ask a single question and spent a large portion of time telling me why being an engineer was the most difficult career known to man. \n15. Substance use issues (primarily marijuana and alcohol). Struggled with codependency, high levels of anxiety. \n16. Used to kill small animals as a child, don’t think I need to say anything else about this one. \n17. Spent 90% of the date talking about his love for bicycles (no, he did not ask me if I was interested in biking). Expressed a desire to have 3 children and home school them (no, he did not ask me about my family plans or future goals). This was not mentioned on his profile at all. \n18. Tried to convince me how awful cats are (despite me having 3 photos with them on my profile. Apparently he had not checked this before he invited me out). \n19. Photos were very misleading. Spoke a lot about his special interests (anime, dinosaurs). Asked me exactly 2 questions. \n20. Really great guy. Got my hopes up for this one. Shared a lot of values. He was quite anxious and I thought it would settle down but he ended up having a bit of a freak out and called it off. \n21. Ended up being poly and didn’t think he needed to share this in advance? \n22. Was in the army and couldn’t comprehend why/how this could be a dealbreaker for women. Didn’t share this on his profile or in the chat when asked about work. \n23. Very, very anxious. Signs of OCD, quite rigid and easily stressed. \n24. Another Jordan Peterson fan. Wanted kids but didn’t include it on his profile. Kept trying to make out with me on the first date in public despite me asking him to stop. \n25. Lots of problems. Made racist, homophobic, and sexist jokes. Would use the f-slur. Very gropey, wouldn’t stop after being told no. \n26. Misleading photos. Genuinely some of the worst conversation I have ever had, it gave me secondhand embarrassment. \n27. Out of work for several years due to an ongoing wrist injury. Severe depression that was “untreatable”. Experienced sudden and random ailments that required him to be taken care of and/or excused from any prior plans.\n28. Another one who used misleading photos. He also didn’t live in the same country and was happy to do a long distance relationship but didn’t mention this on his profile. \n29. Wanted to have 4 children and settle down in a city over an hour away. Also didn’t include this in his profile.\n\nEDIT: just wanted to clarify some things. I’m based in Sydney, Australia. All these men varied in terms of appearance, education, upbringing, etc. I speak to men for 5-7 days before going on a date. Unfortunately it is never really acceptable to be asking questions like “did you kill small animals as a child?” on the apps. Lots of men do weed themselves out during the talking process. \n\nAll my first dates tend to be coffee dates. If it’s an evening date it is usually gelato. I pay for 90% of these dates. I don’t have children and don’t want children, this is always included in my profile. I have a cat, this is also in my profile. No, I will not be giving my cat away for a relationship. \n\nI don’t have any issue dating someone with anxiety, depression, etc. However, when it is so bad that I can’t form a connection with you and you can’t do basic day to day things (e.g., develop and maintain friendships, have any sort of income, engage in hobbies) then I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect someone you don’t know to want to develop a relationship with you 🤷🏻‍♀️\n\nEDIT 2: Lots of people are asking about number 20. We went on 7 dates before he called it off. He had never had a serious relationship before, the longest had been 6 months. I genuinely still think he is a great guy and hold no negative feelings about him.",

It was just interesting because it was paragraphs and engaging conversations and it made me realize how much better a man will treat you if you’re hot regardless of anything else. It’s frustrating how much men complain how they can’t get women or women are so picky, but now I’m fully convinced they are crying because they can’t get the the top tier of women and refuse to connect with anyone more on their level. \n\nThoughts",

All my meetings that day went really well, they made a good offer and included a signing bonus, so here I am working at my new job.\n\nAnyway, I had my first meeting today with the whole team, and I got there early, and met some of my new coworkers that I hadn't seen before.  One of them, a guy in like his 40s, said \"Is it take your daughter to work day?\" and \"Look at how small you are!\" and I was trying to think of something to say but our boss had walked in which neither of us saw, and he said \"I see you have noticed that YouStupidBench is shorter than you are.  Is that going to be a problematic distraction, or will you be able to focus on the job you are paid to do?\"\n\nAnd Mister-Class-Clown said something about \"Just waiting for the meeting to start,\" and then he sat down and didn't say anything for the entire time.  I really appreciated that I didn't have to shut him down.  I have one friend who would have said something like \"What's it to you?\" but I'm worried about being too mean to people at work because I have all of one week being employed here and I do have to work with some of these people so getting off on the wrong foot could have gone pretty badly.  (Fortunately I don't have to work with the guy who was obnoxious today.  Another person said that he's not very personable but he's a great engineer and I shouldn't get too negative about him.  But I'm still glad I'm not on the same sub-team with him.)\n\nI didn't really talk today, but I watched and one of my female coworkers was answering a question and someone moved as if to interrupt her and stopped when the boss shot him a look.  After she finished, he asked if anyone had anything to add, and then the almost-interrupter said what he was going to say.  Anyway, it's only been a week so far, and there's one guy who's kind of a jerk but I really like my boss.  The general sense I get is that he insists things be done properly, and commenting on someone's appearance, or interrupting someone who is speaking, are both improper.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "text": "Got yelled at at work by a man who's not my boss in the middle of a meeting Not sure of I'm looking for advice or to commiserate, but this happened first thing when I got to work and I'm still angry when I think about it. \n\nBack story: \nI'm an engineer for a large company, one of the parts of the company is nutrition where we make things in bottles with twist off caps. One of the specs we measure is removal torque of the cap. If it's not on tight enough, there isn't a seal; if it's on too tight, it's too hard for consumers to get off. \n\nRecently, a daily task was given to me to pull the torque data for the past 24 hours to go over in a morning touch base meeting with quality, maintenance, operations, etc. The meeting is at 9:30 and they wanted it from 9 am the previous day to 9 am that day. I told them that that wouldn't be possible to have ready for the meeting and I asked to pull it before I left the day before. So on Friday mornings we review the data from Wednesday at 4 pm to Thursday at 4 pm. On Monday we review the data from Thursday to Friday. \n\nLast pieces to the puzzle is that my specific line was down from Tuesday afternoon until Thursday evening. I was also off on Friday.\n\nActual story:\nThis morning I show up to work and go straight to the morning meeting. The manager of operations wants to review torque data and I tell him that it was not pulled on Friday as I was out and no one covered that part of my job. He immediately is agitated and starts yelling at me asking why no one did this, why wasn't it covered, etc. I try to calmly explain that I was out on scheduled PTO, my supervisor should have made sure there was coverage for my job, and that I would pull it when I go back to my desk. He just keeps going though, almost berating me over this data that was not pulled and how I need to make sure it get pulled even if I'm off and how unacceptable every answer I give him is. Honestly, I saw red, I was so pissed. And I am actually proud of myself for not taking his yelling laying down, not apologizing, and staying calm. \n\nAfter this meeting, even one of the other engineers said something to me about it and could tell I was mad. Not only did he yell at me, but he yelled at me in a multidisciplinary meeting in front of a dozen people. \n\nThe icing on the cake this morning was that my manager emailed me very shortly after asking why the torque data spreadsheet hadn't been updated since Tuesday afternoon. Reminder, the line didn't run from Tuesday until Thursday evening and I wasn't here Friday to pull the data. \n\nNormally, I would have been annoyed and moved on, but after getting yelled at by a man so far out of my reporting structure, I was ready to quit. She has been know to go behind me and recheck my decisions and requests and question me or just reply and change it to what she thinks. If you don't trust me to do my job and are just going to come behind me and do it anyway, why am I even here? \n\nLuckily, no one was using the conference room after us, so I was able to stay behind and cry a little and calm myself down. I went back to my desk and found out my friend was leaving so I took his office for the day and just worked and listened to music. \n\nAs annoyed as I was with my manager, I sent her an email as I left work explaining briefly what happened this morning. I told her it was absolutely uncalled for and unprofessional and that if it happens again I am walking away and escalating it.",

    "text": "I’m a female engineer at a large aerospace company. I have done well here. A new coworker is pushing me over the edge. I don’t know where to start. I’m gonna have to water this down to avoid identification. Throwaway account for the same reason. \n\nI am a test engineer at a large aerospace company that does work for the government, and our product is involved in safety-sensitive missions. There are certain codes we have to follow to be able to do business with the government, including something called AS9100 which is basically keeping appropriate paperwork and stamp offs/tracking that certain things have been done before the product gets on the final vehicle. We get audited every couple of years and the auditors are very picky and any findings are a big deal that make pain for all of us.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, we hired two new guys into the same role as myself to support the test team. We have a lot going on and need the help. \n\nNow, to preface this, I work with ALL men. There are 1-2 ladies around the building with me, but in our dept I am the only woman. I’m in STEM, I’m used to it. I’m happy to say that in my few years in this role up to now, I haven’t had any problems. Maybe some antiquated comments here and there but nothing worth raising a fuss about. I work with a lot of older men with “old-school” mindsets, but I have truly managed to become part of the team and my gender has not mattered one bit. \n\nNow. As for these new guys. There is a particular part of our facility that I have been the focal for for a while. When we hire someone into this role, the natural progression is for them to learn that same role and replace as the focal and the former focal shifts gears. All this to say, I have been more-or-less in charge of training them in this role. \n\nThe new guys have been not great at coming up to speed quickly and have also, in my opinion, been willfully incompetent more than once. However, one (we’ll call him Gary, late 20s) after a few months kicked more into gear and I like him as a person so we have moved past the majority of the friction. When I ask him to do something or explain something, he might have a comment, but he accepts it is part of the role and moves on. I’m good enough with Gary. It is the other guy, we’ll call him Bill (40 YO) that I am absolutely done with. \n\nI am by default a pretty naive person. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt to a fault. I know this position can be a slog. We are doing important things but still get bogged down by ‘annoying’ things like filing all the appropriate paperwork. Sorry to say, but it’s part of the job.\n\nAny time I have come to Bill to explain how certain things work, or ask him to correct something, there is always an excuse or a comment. A complaint about it being annoying is one thing. Debating me on why you shouldn’t have to do something the way I just asked you to is another. It’s exhausting. Mind you, over and over I have been perfectly pleasant, and default to saying something like “I hear you, but X Y Z” and keep a smile on my face. Bc I need the help and I need them to do their jobs and do them right. I don’t want to debate. \n\nAs an example, he forgot to sign something off a couple of weeks ago and I handed him the paper said “hey, I just saw this, can you correct it?”. And his response was “I know for a fact I’ve seen Frank not do it before”. Um. Are you 2 years old? That’s not what I asked. Hand him the paper and walk away trusting he’ll do it and re-file it. \n\nYesterday I was overloaded with a task that was time sensitive and taking most of the day. We were also conducting a test that same day so the new guys were running the show while I focused on that. In general, I have stepped away to let them handle the job. I’m not reviewing their paperwork hardly at all anymore. \n\nWhile I’m working, another engineer comes over to me bc they needed to reference paperwork from last week, and they say, “what’s going on with this?” They show me that the paperwork they pulled was  incomplete. Dozens of items not checked off, yet Bill had filed it as-is and signed off that it had been “reviewed”. I roll my eyes, exhausted that once again I’m going to have to bring it up, bc every time I bring up this shit I know he sees me as bothering him, not trying to help him out. I check other recent test paperwork and find all of it is the same. Messed up/not completed. Sigh. \n\nI put the papers on his desk so we can talk about it. At that time he was away for the test. I notice that the paper that I literally handed to him before saying the 5 second thing he needed to do, was only halfway done, and I can only think it was willfully missed because it’s fucking easy. I become livid. I go to my managers office and relay that I have corrected these guys on this stuff so many times and I’m done. I make sure he knows they, moreso Bill, are still doing it incorrectly and I’m not making it my problem anymore. He understands and agrees. I mention the incident with the signature and say, without saying the quiet part, that at this point I cannot ignore anymore that Bill clearly does not respect me. To that, my manager actually says “You know, you work with all men and you’ve been here a while now without any issues. I know you are socially aware in general so my guess is, if your spidey sense is going off, it’s valid. I will talk with Frank to see if he gets the same treatment or if it may be because you’re a woman. Either way, don’t help them or save their ass on stuff like that anymore. They can come to you if something comes up but other than that I want you to step away”. I feel a bit better and leave his office. \n\nI had already put the paperwork on Bill’s desk before talking with my manager, so I know when Bill comes back he will see it. I plan to talk to him one more time and then be done. \n\nI see him go back to his desk. A couple of minutes go by. He doesn’t ask me about the paperwork. I know he knows I left it there. I walk over and see him filling out the stuff left out. Conversation goes as follows. \n\nMe: “Hey, I guess you figured out why I left that stuff there” \n\nBill: “Yeah, some missing check marks” \n\nMe (tone irritated, but professional): “Yeah. I just need to have a quick talk with you guys” (I lump Gary into it in an attempt to make it less targeted at Bill because his desk is right there). “When you sign off on (other document) that you’ve done this review, you’re saying you’ve done X,Y, and Z. It makes sure we haven’t missed anything and that everything has been turned in. If we had an audit and they saw that paperwork that way, it would be a problem” \n\nBill, smirking/laughing at me and shaking his head says, again: “It’s just a few check marks”\n\nMe, totally DONE: “It’s not up to me, Bill. It’s an audit finding. If someone else found it, it would be someone a lot higher up and meaner than me” and I walk away before I unload on him. He continues to smirk and shake his head as I walk away. \n\nI am so beyond unbelievably DONE. This motherfucker seriously thinks I ENJOY bringing this stuff up to him. If I wanted to be a mother, I’d be trying to get pregnant and it wouldn’t be to have a 40 YO MAN BABY!!! Seriously, Bill? GO FUCK YOURSELF WITH A CACTUS. I resign to avoid talking to him from now on.\n\nI go for a walk to vent with another coworker who knew what was going on. I get back and another friend and coworker of mine messages me to say, “If Bill is talking shit, do you want to know about it?” I sigh and say yes. We go for a walk. \n\nApparently, after I walked away, Bill said to Gary that “he doesn’t deserve to be lectured about this stupid shit” and that I’m PROJECTING because *I* feel like I have something to prove. \n\nThis, in particular, is very rich. Not that it matters in the context of him being an asshole, but. I kick ass at this job. And that is not me being full of myself. I know because I get told by everyone that I am reliable, I take ownership, I got promoted faster than standard AND, I achieved approval to do test by myself faster than anyone in our position EVER has. I bust my ass at this job and everyone recognizes that. \n\nI am done with Bill, and truthfully, I don’t care what he thinks. It’s clearly his problem. I take comfort in knowing that anyone that he might say that BS to out here about me ‘having something to prove’, including Gary, would be like, ‘huh?’. Because I do a GREAT fucking job and everybody KNOWS it. I got affirmation from yet ANOTHER coworker who sensed my frustration and pulled me aside to talk that he also suspects Bill’s problem is really with women and in particular, women in authority, because Bill does not treat him that way. \n\nThis job is a grind as it is, not in a good way. I am often exhausted. And having man babies to mother  is not something I signed up for or am willing to do. I fantasize about the day I stop carrying this team and walk out. Bill has no idea how much work I do on his behalf. If I left? HA. I’m unfortunately stuck here/in the area for a while longer for various reasons. But I have a standing offer/connection at another company that I know would be a better position. Just can’t make the move yet. But… If my tolerance for this BS continues to decrease, I may have to find a way to accelerate my timeline. \n\nLots of love to all the sisters out there in STEM and those who deal with the same BS. Thanks for listening.\n\nTL;DR: New hire I’ve been training doesn’t like that I try to teach him how to do his job or make sure he does it right because he thinks I do it for fun and/or because “I have something to prove”. He’s a lazy dick.",

    "text": "Was my (25F) ex (24M) a misogynist? Please help me understand. So me and my ex wanted different things. I wanted to have a stable career and wanted both of us to grow together and also compromise for each other mutually if we felt like. But my partner was quite the opposite, he believed in traditional values and believed that for most women, family comes before career.\n\nHe said he would support me to become successful, however, he would want us to settle down somewhere where his career would be favoured (he had just completed studying medicine and I am a mechanical engineer).\n\nHe said that he would not want to move for me if the need be for my own career, but would expect the same from me, because our mothers would have done the same.\n\nLater on, he said it’s not that he was totally opposed to the idea of moving for me, and that he would want us to discuss and he would do it if it was really important for me.\n\nNow we were from South Asia, and in our tradition, the woman moves to the man’s family home after marriage, and this is the example that he used to tell me that it’s always the girl who moves to where the guy is, that his female friend also moved to his male friend’s place in Australia, where they both are now studying. But becoming a part of one’s family and moving somewhere as a couple are different things right?\n\nHe also said he doesn’t believe that men and women are equal, but they are different and should complement each other, otherwise it causes disharmony, and that most young girls are influenced by social media to take up roles traditionally done by men and even if they do well in them professionally, they end up depressed. That very less women actually have the personality and talent to become a CEO like men do, and it might depress them, that they are blindly following the inspiration of successful women in corporate but they find themselves depressed later on.\n\nAlso, he said that after getting pregnant, it’s the role of the mother to care of the baby and the father to provide, that the father can come back home after his job but since the mom gives birth and the father impregnates, it’s nature that the mom naturally wants to be the one taking care of the baby, because she carries the baby for 9 months and takes care of the baby all day before the father comes home, there is no way she won’t get more attached to the baby He would want me to leave working until the baby grows up, and then come back early from work when I start working, because the father cannot leave his job and has to provide. I have no problem leaving work for 3 years or so but something felt wrong.\n\nWhen I said that it’s the role of both the parents to take care of the child he said that it’s not relegating responsibility, but it’s how it should be, that the husband will support the new mother but has to go do his job as well. He also said that women are innately more keen to sacrifice their career for their husband and family, and that’s what gives them a high position in the society, making them even greater than men, that if anyone has to be lesser, it’s men, and the saying that behind every successful man there is a woman is true. When I asked him who’s behind a successful woman, he said that’s the great thing that she doesn’t need anyone to do that.\n\nAlso, he gave me an example of his female friend who wouldn’t study surgery because it’s time consuming and wants to take care of her family after marriage and said that that’s how women generally are, they are better caretakers and men are competitive, that men can work longer hours than women because women tend to take care of their families, and hence there are less women than men in the workforce, and it’s not mainly due to gender discrimination.\n\nHe also talked about the IQ bell curve, showing that women are more in the middle and men towards the extremes and hence there are more men who are geniuses and more men who are homeless or in jail, hence we are different. He also used an example of my field, that there are less women there as men and women have different interests. But he also told me that he wants me to be successful and that I don’t fully understand him, but I feel his thinking was contradictory.\n\nSo we broke up, because he said it’s not wrong for me to be ambitious but I should find someone who understands that, but all this makes me feel like an exception, although he didn’t say it directly. He said we shouldn’t come in each other’s paths and he wishes the best for me. I have been feeling like something is wrong with me ever since the breakup. That I’m not like most women. And yes, people who have read my previous post, it was about my boyfriend, I had been dating him, and my confidence in myself is a mess post breakup. Please help me understand whether he was a misogynist or simply traditionalist. And why am I feeling like an exception after the breakup.",

    "text": "Thursday                                   Had an interesting Thursday, felt like sharing a journal entry. Apologies for the formatting\n\n Thursday\n\n\tI hurriedly knock, apologize for the wait, pull up my stool and sit down. Bob sits in his chair; I sit on mine. His hands are shaky today, clasping a hand written note with five items on it. “I’m tired.” Bob is an engineer by training, long since retired. He’s often understated, but always organized. “I just don’t seem to have any energy and I get short winded these days.” These are items one and two. He doesn’t look at me, just peers over his rimmed glasses at his note, neatly penned on fancy stationery with geese at the top. His wife was fond of geese, and used to be his focus during visits with me. \n\nMy mind drifts a bit. I’ve read about Bob before I stepped in the room. It’s my job, you see. I’m to fix his problems, ease his dis-ease. Set things right. But in Bob’s case, I already know he’s full of cancer. I’ve been walking with him, starting 2 years ago at diagnosis. I have been there through his cryoablation of kidney cancer. Clear cell renal carcinoma. The procedure nearly killed him, and he recovered very poorly and slowly. Bob became very confused, as is common with people with mild cognitive impairment after a large insult to their body. It looks a lot like Alzheimer’s, and is similar, in a way. The disorientation, confusion, frailty. Family was concerned he didn’t know who he was, where he was, when it was. That he was so weak and unbalanced, falling all the time. He used to lead his family, a strong patriarch. Daughters and son in laws would tell me that something just wasn’t right, that he seemed a mere shell of himself. A wraith, faded away and unable to take care of Mabel. It had been my idea to put them both in the nursing home, and a bit of paternalistic nudging saw it done. \n\nHe eventually recovered after spending many unhappy months in long term nursing care. During his stay, Mabel withered away from a myriad of conditions including paralysis of a leg, a stroke and too many birthdays. She’s been buried more than a year now. I remember signing her card from the clinic. “It was a privilege to have played a small part in Mabel’s care. Thank you for the opportunity to be a part of your lives, and my sincere condolences at your loss.” I’m sure I wrote some such platitude. I sign a few of these cards each week. Some I know better, some less well. \n\nNow it’s Bob’s turn. He is telling me that sometimes he has such terrible pain in the right flank that he cannot stay standing up to shave, and has to sit in a chair. He’s stoic, quiet, and understated, the way many octogenarian men of his generation are. I’m sure he is minimizing his pain. “I see you saw the oncologist last month. What did they tell you?” I ask. “The spot in my lung is smaller. We’re going to do another CT in a few months. Looks like it is going well,” he tells me. I’m already running behind, about 10 minutes. I have a choice, I can have him follow – up with oncology, and do a standard fatigue workup. Check some blood, some iron, talk about sleep, depression and send him on his way. I mean, he’s already seeing the oncologist for his cancer, right? They’re taking care of things. \n\n“Did they tell you that you that this cancer is going to kill you? That this is a terminal disease, and will likely be the cause of your death?” There’s a loud silence. Deafening. Bob stares at me. I look back and him and sit, perched with my legs crossed, peering back over my glasses and waiting with open body language for his response. Seconds pass. Tens of seconds. His hand shakes, and squeezes his list, crinkling the paper audibly. He knew, or at least I suspect he knew, that something was very wrong. I had read the consult notes, full of euphemisms such as “conservative approach” and “longitudinal monitoring.” I don’t like these words. Die, death, kill, fatal. These words are better. These are not nice words, but there is no mistaking their meaning. If I think a patient is going to die, I tell them “I think you are going to die.” It’s too easy to weasel out of the discomfort and couch things in medical jargon and pleasant euphemisms. \n\nThese situations often put me in mind of an apocryphal story I was told in my training. A Mexican immigrant had been at the hospital, admitted after some terrible injury. He was whisked from the emergency department to the operating room by the trauma team. As often happens, despite the best efforts of the team, this poor man succumbs to his injuries and dies. A resident, a doctor in training, is dispatched to the waiting room to break the news to family. No one in the family speaks English except the 14-year-old son. “I’m sorry to give you this news, but we’ve lost your father,” the resident solemnly intones. After the deceased’s son translates the news, the family is appropriately shocked, grieving wife, daughters and sister begin crying. The resident withdraws to give them time to grieve as a family, but when he returns in a few minutes with the attending physician and ancillary staff, the family is nowhere to be found. A harried search ensures, and the family is found wandering the hospital grounds in the parking lot and surrounding park, calling out their father’s name. He was lost, and now they have desperately gone to find him. \n\nQueue morbid laughter. The lesson here was supposed to be – always used a licensed hospital interpreter and never family members. Also use plain language and not euphemisms or expressions. “Your son is dead.” “Your wife died.” It seemed silly at the time, and I’ve never been able to verify if it was actually a true story. But I’ve had occasion to tell so many people “your baby is dead” that I can’t remember them all. But my teachers were right, because I’ve seen what happens when it isn’t said that way. \n\n After the long silence, Bob clears his throat. “Oh. I didn’t realize that it was that serious. I thought it was no big deal.” “I think your body is wearing out. This isn’t good news, and you have uncurable cancer. That’s why you’ve been so tired. That’s why you’re getting more short of breath.” \n\nBefore walking into the room, I spent 10 minutes between patients hurriedly pouring over prior testing that I had ordered and specialists had done. Normal Echocardiogram 6 months ago, EF 55%, grade 1 diastolic dysfunction, blood pressure normotensive, no significant weight gain, mild weight loss of 3 lbs in 2 months, physical exam is euvolemic today, no conversational dyspnea; my medical assistant tells me he had mild exertional dyspnea with normal Sp02 from his walk in from the waiting room. Physical exam unremarkable. Bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound done 3 months ago for hilar adenopathy with 2.8x2.1cm subpleural right mass with no evidence of lymphatic spread, surgical path of subpleural lesion consistent with renal oligometastatic disease, not a lung cancer. Suboptimal sampling of the lymph nodes. Cannot exclude regional metastasis with persistent right hilar lymphadenopathy on repeat CT chest. No clear evidence of regional recurrence in right kidney, changes consistent with post-ablation therapy, clinically correlate. New 1.8x1.6cm mass at upper pole of left kidney, concerning for renal malignancy; recommend MRI and/or tissue sampling/excision for further evaluation. No evidence of abdominal or pelvic metastasis. \n\nI am not a cancer doctor. I don’t want to be wrong. Can’t be wrong. I’m giving a terminal diagnosis. He asks me “Well, what do we do next? Can we beat this thing?” I already know the answer is no. I tell him a rehearsed script about how doctors like to fix problems, but some things cannot be fixed. That we can actually do more harm than good trying our very best. I broach the topic of hospice. He wants to know how long he has. They usually ask me this. I tell Bob that I will give a call to his oncologist, because these things are unpredictable, but that I think I would hurt him more than help by doing more tests, more needles, more tubes, more tests. I tell him that patient’s on hospice actually live longer than patients receiving aggressive care. (I doubt myself, and look up the study again for probably the 40th time, per AAFP review from 2007 showing that patients with a terminal diagnosis of cancer had a median survival that was statistically significantly longer in lung, pancreatic or metastatic melanoma by up to three months but not in colon, prostate or breast cancer. This is likely not generalizable to my patient. Evidence based medicine is a bitch). \n\nTime’s up. Time to send Bob out the door. He came here with a list of 5 things, and his chief complaint is he wants to be less tired. Instead of making him feel better, I told him he’s dying, so long and thanks for all the fish. I am now 35 minutes behind. I have 4 patients waiting. An infected butt abscess, a cold that needs a work note, a well-known-to-me patient who is a demanding hypochondriac and someone who has been waiting to get their child vaccinated so they can get back to work. I give Bob an after visit summary (what a fucking joke), some promises that I will talk to his cancer doctor, to his daughter and that I will call him later. \nTime for the next patient. I put on a smile, open the door and ask a 13 year old if he’s decided what he’s going to be when he grows up. “Did you do anything fun this summer?”\n\nSomewhere in the middle of my day I call the oncologist. He agrees it’s recurrent, metastatic and now with a probable new primary malignancy in the left kidney. Bob is not a curative treatment candidate, and a poor candidate even for palliative immunotherapy. They agree hospice is “reasonable.” “These kidney cancers are weird. Could be weeks or years. You never know.” Thanks. The oncologist asks how my father is doing, and to say hi. He’s worked with him for decades. “Still chugging along. Go “local sports team” I say.” \n\nI finish my day early somehow. I have 27 phone messages, 32 lab and imaging results, 8 cc’d notes, 14 MyChart™ messages to address. One of these is a phone call from Bob’s daughter. Bob called her and told her he “doesn’t have long,” – Provider please address, the copied message says. I call and talk with her, tell her that I talked to oncology, they agree that he’s terminal. Yes, it’s serious. No I don’t know why this wasn’t more explicit at their last visits. Yes, he has a new cancer in the left kidney. I talk about hospice. Bob and his wife Mabel and daughter had a great experience with hospice care during the end of her life (go me for early referral? #selfcare). Yes, they’d be open to visiting with hospice for admission. I call Bob and repeat everything. I call my hospice coordinator. He’s to be admitted tomorrow. Not every nurse saves lives. God made some to give out angel wings. \n\nTomorrow is Friday. TGIF.\n\n\nI stare at my computer for a bit at the end of the day. I picture Bob sitting alone in his assisted living apartment, clutching his stationery with the fabulous geese on top. Five problems. In the dark. I cry for a little while by myself, then pack up to go home. \n\n\nThursday.",

    "text": "Hating Nursing - Ranting Gotta rant for a bit. For background purposes, I am a new-grad nurse that graduated last December. Since then, I passed the NCLEX and have had two jobs since then. I started as a med/surg nurse in February and quit after 3 months. Took a month off and went into OR nursing which is where I currently reside at the moment. I’m in Month 4 of my orientation and I couldn’t had been any more stressed and pessimistic. I wake up every single morning five days out of the week to come to work and feel inadequate at my job. Then you got nurses and everyone else voicing their complaints towards management of how stupid their new policies are and how “GLORIOUS” it would be to quit. Doesn’t help that the other new-grads hired months before me that are JUST getting off orientation are also wanting to quit. In addition, my orientation has no structure and I’m constantly walking in with no clue of what to expect or how much I am expected by everyone to know so far. I just really hate this, man. Doesn’t help that I don’t feel as if I am getting paid enough and that some random guy out there is working a much easier job and less stressful environment at $25 an hour than I am at $30+. I am even considering calling into work tomorrow for the very first time on this job. It just sucks. I don’t even know what to do. I come out of work with no energy and lost interest in the things I loved doing. I gained 15+ lbs over the past few months and now I really don’t feel like I belong in nursing. It’s worse knowing that some of my  preceptors told me that new hires (and even experienced OR nurses) usually quit before orientation is over. Like what was the point of telling me that? That doesn’t ease the anxiety even more. Sometimes I think every single FUCKING night why I chose nursing and why I couldn’t had gone into engineering or business. Do any OR new grads feel the same? Any nurses? I hate everything…",

    "text": "A new proposal for disruptive kids EDIT: I've been reading every comment and trying to reply to every single one, but I just read one comment that I think meets both my concerns and the concerns of my (many) critics.  It's really short, but give it a look: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/18f5a4u/comment/kcsebj1/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/18f5a4u/comment/kcsebj1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**MY ORIGINAL POST:** \n\nI think the majority of teachers agree that violent and disruptive students should not be allowed to stay in our classrooms.  But what should we do with them then?\n\nOne poster recently suggested that we just let them voluntarily disenroll, because they don’t want to be there.  I’ve seen others suggest that we need to bring back schools for the ill-behaved, where they can be regulated more strictly (or not) but at least they won’t be disrupting the majority of kids.\n\nI’m proposing something rather radical that (I think) is new and wanted to get some feedback.  Here it is:\n\n**I would allow parents and children to decide together to leave a traditional public school at age 12, provided that child had been accepted into an accredited apprenticeship program**. Such programs could include such familiar trades as plumbers, electricians, HVAC, and carpentry, but in my vision they could also include computer programming and other fields.  This would mean a major revamping of our educational structure, because of course, there aren’t any such places for 12-year-olds now.  My thinking is that these kids are disruptive because they are bored, and giving them (at least) a four years head start on the workplace will allow them greater financial independence as adults.  60 years ago, it was perfectly ordinary for a 21-year old to be able to buy a house.  Today it's almost unheard of.  But a 21-year old who learned a trade from the age of 12 and had been working from the age of 16 would be in a much stronger position, financially.\n\nSo what do people think we should do?  Reform school, a trade route, or no school at all?\n\nEDIT:  I can't keep up with the comments, but I'd like to address several common objections I've seen here:\n\n1. ***These kids can't be entrusted with the responsibility to build a house or install an electrical panel.***  Well, of course not.  But we don't give that responsibility to anyone when they start in the trade.  No 21-year old, fresh as an electrical engineer, is told, \"Go put this panel over on that wall in the location on this here blueprint\".  It takes years of experience before anyone is allowed to do that.\n2. ***These kids won't be able to do the paperwork and tax forms associated with owning a business.***  Well, no, they won't.  But most people don't own the business they work for and most don't have employees.  But they can learn if that is the path they seek years down the road.  I knew a man who did not finish high school and knew no math at all when he began working as a laborer in the seafood industry.  Fifteen years later, he was the superintendent of the plant he had started in, but he sure had to learn a lot of paperwork before he could do that.  People can and do learn more after they start working.\n3. ***Kids won't be allowed on dangerous sites.***  I agree that this is an obstacle, but there's no saying that the apprenticeship would have to start on construction sites.  There could (and certainly should be) training facilities, perhaps run by the trades themselves (who already do this with 16-year olds) before kids are allowed on site.  I also recognize that there are legal issues at play here, and I'm trying to emphasize that this is not something I see a school board creating by fiat.  It would require a wholescale re-imagining of schools and a corresponding change in laws.",

    "text": "Is This Real Or Was My Monster Spiked? I have been trying to wrap my head around the shit storm that is the Texas government's take on educational reform for the \"betterment of the students\". Please correct me if I am wrong. Here is what Texas is doing to \"protect the children\":\n\n1) 3rd Graders will learn how to tie a tourniquet in case of a school shooting. Because 8 year olds make great combat medics.\n\n2) LGBTQ+ will not be allowed to be discussed below 9th grade. Because if you say the word \"gay\" near a child they will turn LGBTQ+ with 48 hours. \n\n3) Requires the 10 Commandments to be prominently displayed in every classroom. Because no  Christian has ever done anything bad and no one would break a rule when there is a poster on the wall.  \n\n4) Bans people in drag from reading to children. Because if The Little Engine That Could is read by a man dressed like a woman, the the kids will all turn gay within 48 hours. \n\n5) Gives family $8k towards private school if they don't want their kid in public school. Because everyone in Texas gets paid so much they can afford the other $42k a year in tuition to send their kids to private school. \n\n6) Requires schools to have a \"chain of command\" during an active shooter situation. Because these are now so common that they want a line up of who gives orders over the PA system while people are ducking and diving while trying to not get shot. \n\n7) Banned schools from requiring face masks incase of future outbreaks. Because Covid 19 is gone forever apparently. \n\nOk, so did someone spike my morning Monster and now I am on a bad trip or is this really the direction of the Texas education system?",

She fairly regularly gets yelled at by a parent for giving their child a bad grade or reprimanding them when they misbehave. Worse is when they do it during dismissal when she's trying to make sure her students are going home safely. Plus, that's so disrespectful to do in front of students. But what really angers me is that admin just lets it happen.\n\nI'm an engineer, and if a customer has an issue with the quality of work I do, they don't yell at me; they go to the project manager or my supervisor. That's the way it works. The laborers/workers do the work. The managers and supervisor manage and oversee the work. If there is an issue with the work, it's ultimately the responsibility of the manager. If the customer has an issue with the work, they go to management to get it corrected. They don't yell at me, because it's the manager's responsibility to ensure the work gets done well.\n\nMore than a few times, admin has sat in on meetings and allowed the parents to yell awful, hateful things in my wife's face. Sorry, but your kid is bad because you're a shit parent and allow him to act like a fucking hellspawn at home and then cover his ass when he acts like that elsewhere. Last time there was a meeting like this, a 6'+ 250#+ man got so close to my wife while yelling at her that he was spitting on her face. The principal is a large man, too, but he just sat back and let this big dude flip out at a woman less than half his size crying get eyes out. It feels even worse knowing I can do nothing to protect her in these situations.\n\nIs all admin this chicken shit everywhere? What is the point of admin if not to act as the manager of the teachers? I can't tell you how fucking livid it makes me. Are all parents like this everywhere? She works in a very poor location because it makes her feel like she's making a big improvement in the kids' lives. Is it this way everywhere?

    "text": "Louisiana House Republicans Cut Education Funding to Pay Off Retirement Debt – Who Needs Teachers Anyway? In a move that would make the Smoking Man proud, House Republicans in Louisiana have decided that the best way to save money is to cut funding for education and pay off public employee retirement debt instead.\n\nIf you were wondering why Louisiana ranks 50th in education, wonder no more. House Republicans have finally found a solution to the state's education woes – just get rid of the teachers! Who needs qualified educators when you can have unqualified volunteers running the classrooms? It's like they say, if you can read this, thank a teacher. If you can't, thank a Louisiana House Republican.\n\nBut why stop at eliminating teacher pay raises? Why not just eliminate teachers altogether? After all, it's not like we need educated citizens to run our state or anything. Who needs critical thinking skills, scientific literacy, or an understanding of history when you can just Google everything, right?\n\nOf course, we can't forget about the children. They may not be old enough to vote or make campaign contributions, but they can sure be a nuisance with all their learning and growing and stuff. So why not just cut early childhood education programs too? Who needs to invest in our future when we can just pay off debt?\n\nBut don't worry, it's not all doom and gloom. House Republicans have graciously decided to retain university faculty pay raises. Because, you know, it's not like we need educated college graduates to enter the workforce or anything. Who needs doctors, lawyers, engineers, or scientists when you can just have uneducated politicians running the show?\n\nIn conclusion, the Louisiana House budget plan is a perfect example of why we need to elect officials who prioritize education and invest in our future. Unless, of course, we want to continue living in a world where ignorance is bliss and the truth is out there, but no one knows what it is.",

    "text": "Rant about Inspiration \\*One good teacher can change your life\\*  \nWhen I was a sophomore in college I took Calculus 3. Wow? Big whoop? Am I right? Most college students in my program took Calculus 3. But I was NOT most college students...when I entered University of Illinois college of engineering, I could not even make a regular scatter plot, given a table of data, let alone calculate 3-D travel.  \nThen I took Thomas Carty's calc 3 course. I remember it DISTINCTLY. Altgeld hall is a historic, fabulous, gothic-looking building. Many a rainy and dreary Illinois days I walked to this hall from my cramped apartment on green street and trudged up the steps to the largest auditorium in Altgeld. Through rain and snow, and even the Illinois \"Snowpocolypse\", I trudged to Altgeld to hear Thomas Carty speak. The springs in the seat cushions stabbed at the thighs and the collapsable armchair note-taking stands were far too tiny for even a regular 10 inch spiral notebook. This auditorium did not have smart boards, it had chalk boards, to which professor Carty wrote long, elaborate formulae and would erase the information when HE saw fit, so you better copy it down fast.   \nEveryone despised him, thought he was mean. Not me. Already at a deficit compared to the rich Chicago kids with their AP courses and SAT prep, I went to his evening office hours as if it were my job.   \nOne afternoon I went to Prof Carty's office for help, when most students would not approach him due to his abrasiveness, and I saw a picture of him at his desk. The irony of it caught my attention: this big, beer-bellied math genius, holding his two small children on his shoulders.  One evening in office hours, one of Tom Carty's TAs taught me to calculate the velocity of the mushroom cloud of combustion emitted from the death star, before I had even known what Star Wars even was.   \nThe man was a nerd, total nerd. The teacher assistants he hired were also nerds. And thank the lord for that, because they normalized the unattainable for me, and that was the pursuit of higher ed. Many times I felt that I didn't belong on that campus, or in the prestigious, gothic auditoriums of Altgeld, or in the vast swatches of green grass across the quad. And many of times I thought to quit...that it was just too much, and I wasn't cut out for it. I was, after all, just some white-trash kid from central Illinois. But Tom Carty's calculus 3 class taught me differently.   \nThey inspired us, plain and simple. They taught us to look at the world around us with curiosity, some jigsaw puzzle to be solved. They taught us the secret language of the mathmeticians and the scientists: their notations and their shorthand and their completely elegant ways of deciphering the world. And they taught us that ANYONE can do it, all you need is simply the desire to learn it. All you need is the desire to learn it.   \nSo, in this world where teachers are so heavily berated and so pitifully paid, perhaps it's a good reminder, that just one good one can pave the way.  :) end of my rant.",

    "text": "A nice little moment I'm not a teacher, but was considering becoming one a few years back (which is why I'm subbed here). Anyway, that's besides the point of my story.\n\nThis morning I was chatting with an online group about a design for a random 3D object. People were posting napkin sketches of their ideas. I had a pretty clear idea of what I wanted to do in my head, but it would take too long to render my idea in CAD, so I did a pen & paper sketch myself. I did an old-school top/side/front drawing of the component I had in mind.\n\none of the guys online asked me if I was an engineer, because my technical drawing was fairly detailed for being just a napkin drawing. I told them I'm not, just an IT grunt. Then someone asked if I took engineering classes in college. I respond that I did not. I actually went to college for Psychology (funny how some careers hardly match the degrees).\n\nI thought about it for a second, \"where DID I pickup this knowledge?\" That's when I remembered my middle school shop class back in the late 90s.\n\nThat's right, some time when I was 12 and 13, I went to a US school that let us use miter saws, drill presses, and all sorts of cool (but pretty damn dangerous) tools. However, between projects, the teacher taught us the \"boring\" stuff that goes along with building things, like making technical drawings.\n\nOur teacher was stern, strict, and fairly unforgiving (which makes sense considering the equipment we were using). He was an older man, kinda short and stocky, like a Ron Swanson type but with gray hair. During our lessons involving technical drawings, he never seemed satisfied with any of our drawings. Everything had to be absolutely perfect and precise.\n\nOur shop teacher was the butt of many jokes amongst us students when he wasn't around. Because... you know, kids are kids and like to poke fun at just about everything.\n\nFast forward to just this morning, and my little online interaction which sent me down that memory lane, it made me appreciate my old shop teacher. I doubt he's still alive, and I also doubt many of my peers in that class retained that skill of being able to sketch up a design in that particular manner...\n\nBut I remembered. I took that skill and kept it with me, and utilized it here-and-there throughout the years. It's 2 decades later, and something relatively insignificant reminded me of him. It reminded me of all my teachers that gave me something that helped me develop some sort of skills.\n\nThere have been so many little things that various teachers in my life. Some were off-the-cuff statements that were particularly profound for me, or skills that seemed arbitrary, but acted as a seed that allowed me to build upon it later in life. A seed of familiarity when I found out that I'd actually find that skill useful (like logic truth tables. I hated them at the time during my logic class).\n\nAnyway. I know that's a long and meandering story with no dramatic ending... but I felt compelled to tell that to all you teachers. You might not be liked by all your students while they're under your guidance. They might poke fun of you amongst their friends. They might say things like, \"I'm never going to use this.\" But some of them will use those skills. Some of them poke fun just to try and be cool to their friends. Some of them will significantly appreciate you in retrospect. Some of them will never see you again, but they'll remember you.\n\nYou matter to more kids than you realize.",

I’m a 21 year old man from Ohio who, after spending 3 years working retail, has decided to pursue a higher education and have a career I’m passionate about. \n\nMy true passion is history. I’ve loved history ever since my grandparents took me to Gettysburg as a teenager. I adore everything about history. The lessons it teaches, the wisdom it instills, the cause and effect, and of course, the people who experienced it. Once I begin talking about history, and why it’s still relevant today, you have no hope of getting me to stop. \n\nFrom a young age, I was always told that I would be a great history teacher. People saw my passion for the subject, and my skill at sharing that passion with others. I love getting others excited about history!\n\nBut I always shied away from teaching because of the incredible number of horror stories I’ve heard about. Whether the antagonist is the compensation, the bureaucracy, a power hungry principle, uncontrollable kids, outraged parents, or a combination of all of these, the story is always the same. DONT BE A TEACHER! \n\nAnd I listened. For the longest time, I listened. But the desire to teach high school history has not left my heart. It would be a dream come true if I could teach the next generation why history is so important. I want to show them that names and dates aren’t the true lessons of history. I want to instill in their minds how history teaches us to be independent thinkers, responsible citizens, and wise individuals. By taking the lessons from the past, and applying them to the present, we can be better equipped to avoid the pitfalls of humanity. Just thinking about giving them this knowledge gets me excited! \n\nBut I’m scared. I’m scared because I don’t want a life of misery and poor salary. I want to be financially stable (with the ability to support a family). I want a nice house. I want to travel at least once a year. And I’m scared that I won’t have the ability to achieve these things if I become a teacher. \n\nMy other pathway is to become an Aerospace engineer. I have excelled in my math courses, and I think I would still enjoy the work. But my heart continues to call me back to teaching high school history. \n\nI would be grateful to hear your advice. Thank you for your time.",

    "text": "Pigeon Shit Manifesto Awhile ago I spent my day scrubbing pigeon shit off the brick stoops of a meditation hall in downtown San Francisco.\n\nPigeons eat mostly trash. And city pigeons eat city trash. Imagine shit made of city trash. It’s ultra-hyper concentrated - weapons-grade shit-trash uranium.  \n\nThat’s when I was living as a Zen monk. Now I make $150K to sit in a warehouse. And I long for the days of scrubbing shit, mopping floors, and dusting altars.\n\nWhy is this so?\n\nI can’t figure it out. But I’ll take a crack at it.\n\nBelow are some lines from a commencement address by Bill Watterson. It’s titled “Thoughts on the real world from someone who glimpsed it and fled”. (This should give you a flavor for where this essay is going … and where I’m going.)\n\n*So, what's it like in the real world? Well, the food is better, but beyond that, I don't recommend it…*\n\n*We all have different desires and needs, but if we don't discover what we want from ourselves and what we stand for, we will live passively and unfulfilled. Sooner or later, we are all asked to compromise ourselves and the things we care about. We define ourselves by our actions. With each decision, we tell ourselves and the world who we are. Think about what you want out of this life, and recognize that there are many kinds of success.*\n\n*Many of you will be going on to law school, business school, medical school, or other graduate work, and you can expect the kind of starting salary that, with luck, will allow you to pay off your tuition debts within your own lifetime.*\n\n*But having an enviable career is one thing, and being a happy person is another.*\n\n*Creating a life that reflects your values and satisfies your soul is a rare achievement. In a culture that relentlessly promotes avarice and excess as the good life, a person happy doing his own work is usually considered an eccentric, if not a subversive. Ambition is only understood if it's to rise to the top of some imaginary ladder of success. Someone who takes an undemanding job because it affords him the time to pursue other interests and activities is considered a flake. A person who abandons a career in order to stay home and raise children is considered not to be living up to his potential-as if a job title and salary are the sole measure of human worth.*\n\n*You'll be told in a hundred ways, some subtle and some not, to keep climbing, and never be satisfied with where you are, who you are, and what you're doing. There are a million ways to sell yourself out, and I guarantee you'll hear about them.*\n\n*To invent your own life's meaning is not easy, but it's still allowed, and I think you'll be happier for the trouble*.\n\nWhen I think of my longing for pigeon shit scrubbing, I’m half-tempted to do some technical analysis of the psychological principles at work (efficacy, purpose, etc.).\n\nTruthfully, I’m not sure how to explain why that work now seems so enviable. I don’t know what the best adjective is – but it felt like the opposite of selling out. The word that keeps coming up is soul. The work felt like it had soul! (Do I sound crazy yet?... I will).\n\nThis feeling isn’t practical. And maybe it’s all in my head that I was serving some greater Buddhist cause of ending suffering for all beings. But I was the one scrubbing the shit. And I’m the one earning $1 per minute in this god forsaken warehouse. And I can tell you that right now it feels like my soul is slowly seeping out through the bottoms of my shoes.\n\n(The food is pretty good though.)\n\nIf you want to understand why meaning matters, do what I do. Contemplate death. You’re going to die, you know. You’re dying right now (so am I).\n\n*Ask yourself this question: when you die how will you know you lived a good life? Really, answer it.*\n\nOdds are you’ll think about things like to love and be loved, or make the world a better place, or live a rich, full life. I’m guessing money didn’t make the list? How about your title or the prestigious and impressive shit you did? Money is important. Success is great. But it won’t supply all the meaning you need.\n\nThe easy thing to do at this point is dismiss this. Say “Jackson, you’re a fucking a hippy, man. And a know-it-all”. (Both accurate). Because if you take this stuff about meaning seriously and you listen to your inner wisdom, your life is going to get a lot harder. What’s the meaning of your work? Are you really doing something that matters? Is it fulfilling your soul or making you yearn for something more?\n\nAre you working in a hospital? Yeah your work is probably pretty worthwhile even though it’s a bitch.\n\nAre you a college professor genuinely invested in your students? I’d say yeah your work is meaningful.\n\nAre you a senior VP at a large bank? The marketing director at a tech company? You say you’re making the world a better place. Are you?\n\nI don’t know. Maybe you are. But it’s worth being a little skeptical. Our culture puts folks like Steve Jobs on a pedestal. I don’t think changing the world or being a business icon are the same as making the world a better place. Maybe that’s a scorching hot take for an American writer to offer to an American reader.\n\nBut hear me out. Is technological progress or innovation or “growth” inherently good? Is revolutionary innovation equivalent to more happiness and less suffering?\n\nIt’s easy for me to say I’m an essential worker. I get industrial goods from my warehouse to manufacturers all over the country. This work is the lifeblood of the American economy. So on and so forth. Now I'm not making the world a *worse* place. But it’s a stretch for me to call this work soulful or meaningful. It feels a lot more like churning the gears of a massive economic engine than serving my fellow human beings.\n\nSo I don’t think you should beat up on yourself. Or get defensive. It’s just that what I don’t want to have happen to bright folks like you is to get to the end of your life and think, “fuck, what did I just do?”.\n\nI might have pretty high standards for meaning. But I’d wager that when you’re nearing the end of your life, then you will too. So make your money. Be successful. And don’t take some dumbass writer too seriously – but make sure you don’t lose your soul either.\n\nSelling out often means buying in – buying in to some bullshit definition of a fulfilling life. And in my opinion that’s what our current culture  has to offer in the way of personal philosophy: bullshit.\n\nThe happiness prescription is hustle, beat the next guy, rise to the top. Then you’ll have made it. Then you can be happy.\n\nBut what you’ll find is the only thing you’ll have made is an ass of yourself. Because our society’s bullshit happiness advice has made an ass of us all. Don’t believe me? Scroll twitter. Turn on Fox or CNN. Try tik-tok.\n\nHow are we doing? Totally f\\*\\*ked seems like an appropriate summary. Then dig into the stats on anti-depressant, anti-anxiety, and ADHD medications. A gander at climate change trends and wealth distribution might not hurt either. But that’s a whole other rabbit hole. The current socioeconomic situation really feels like one big scheme to rob us of our happiness and sell it back to us (then repeat).\n\nNow we’ve come a long way since the fun and innocent talk of pigeon shit. And I’m sure you’re tiring of my sermon. So what I’ll leave you with is this.\n\nIf you want to do the opposite of whatever selling your soul is. Then don’t buy in. Don’t listen to the marketing messages or the Instagram gurus or the bullshit philosophy of our current culture. Don’t even listen to me.\n\nListen to your inner wisdom. Think about living a life you won’t regret. Read the wisdom that’s lasted 1000s of years – the Bible, the Buddha, the Stoics… And try to find work that builds you up rather than breaks you down. This is something that you *feel* not something you *think*.\n\nIt won’t always make sense - but my experience has been that you can *feel* what’s soulful, what’s true, and what makes you happy. And you can *feel* when you sell out. \n\n**My pigeon shit manifesto is this: work to live, don’t live to work. And don’t settle for anything less than enjoying your life.**",

    "text": "I'm 22 and I feel like a failure. what should i do? My story began when I was 18. I had just finished high school and received a scholarship to attend a good engineering college in a big city, far from my parents' home. This scholarship was essential because my family couldn't afford the tuition and other college expenses. My hope was to change my family's financial situation and give them the freedom to travel the world.\r  \n\r  \nI worked hard, studied diligently, and engaged in various projects during my first semester. In my second semester, I met a girl in one of my projects, and we started dating. She was cute and friendly, which was a big deal for me since I hadn't experienced much attention from others before. I got attached to her, and after five months, she suddenly broke up with me. This hit me hard, and I struggled to concentrate on my studies or anything else.\r  \n\r  \nTo cope with this, I turned to the gym to work on my physique, as I had always been skinny. I made some progress, but then the COVID-19 pandemic struck, and I lost my gains during the lockdown. My eyesight weakened, and I faced disruptions in my studies due to internet issues. I also became socially isolated, which led me to dwell on memories of the relationship.\r  \n\r  \nWhen college resumed, I resolved to focus on my studies, but I felt overwhelmed by how much my peers had progressed. I tried to catch up but struggled. Feeling lost, I looked for alternative ways to secure an income and turned to day trading. Unfortunately, I lost a significant portion of my scholarship in the process. I couldn't afford the gym or a proper diet and started feeling out of shape. I also started an Instagram page the same time I started day trading, which gained over 100k+ followers, but I had to sell it due to a financial emergency.  \nComing to 2023, my last semester of engineering. I didn't had any source of income. I couldn't talk to girls ( all my room mates had gf and they would bring them in the apartment, i literally felt so alone) I didn't had the gut to ask any girl out cuz of what happened last time.  \nI had lost all my gains. I was again skinny. I had 2 backlogs. My parents expectation were raising day by day. The company where i was doing internship, refused to pay me stipend. All this left in a depressed state.  \nFast forward to today. I did finished my degree in June and cleared my backlogs. But I'm still unemployed.   \nOut of 3 best friends who were with me at the college, one is going abroad to study further, two just got job with a nice salary.   \nI have applied to 300+ jobs but got just 2 interviews and no job offer. I appeared for few govt. exams as well but who am i kidding, there were 200k students appearing for 1k vacancies with an average of 85 score out of 100. And my best score was 53.  \nCurrently, I'm back at my parents' house, feeling depressed and burdened that i don't have a job, that I couldn't meet the slightest of their expectation, that I didn't get to have a relationship where i could tell someone how i feel, that I'm just a burden to my parents, that I'm of no use to the society. These thought have let me to multiple su\\*cide attempts but the thought of my parents, that they didn't went through hell to feed me, to make me the man that i am just to see me die, always hold me back from doing it.  \nAnd this cycle of self hatred goes on and on and on. I feel like sh\\*t. SH\\*T!!",

    "text": "Should I tell my boss that I'm overwhelmed? To start things off, I have been at the same job for over 5 years. I love my job where I am at and the environment. I was originally hired as a Systems Administrator. As time went on, I started doing more and more. I have a background in dev and automation, so I started implementing those things into my work. I did a lot of training and research and ended up becoming the solo point of contact for anything cloud related, which we have most of our production in the cloud now, so I'm the main point for those workloads. The more I started writing automation, the more the company wanted it. So eventually I stopped doing most System Administrator work and was developing automated solutions to problems and then stepped into the world of DevOps. I started bringing our entire infrastructure into code to increase efficiency and eliminate basic human mistakes and such.  \n\n\nAfter some time, I did end up getting a title change. My title changed from System Administrator to DevOps Engineer. This was a title only change. There was no pay increase for this. I reluctantly accepted it because I enjoyed doing the DevOps work. Because of this, my boss put me in a position where I was halfway on his team (The IT Team) and halfway on the team with the developers for our webapp. This way I could bridge the gap between the two departments and help automate deployments of the webapp itself. This seemed like an ideal spot for me because this is what I enjoyed. But the effects have not been what I thought. The dev team just sees me as \"The IT guy\" and the IT team just considers me a developer at this point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to this point. I am the solo point man now for anything script/automation related. Due to my extensive knowledge of our cloud framework, I am the solo point for anything that pertains to our cloud environments, even down to billing and managing the costs of everything out there. We had a need to start introducing Linux into our environment and I am the only person knowledgeable of Linux, so I am the solo point person for anything related to those servers (Which are mission critical server). And my boss has about 100 DevOps projects he wants me to do. Keep in mind that my boss is an IT guy. He does not understand what goes into some of these projects. He has no clue at all. He really believes that a lot of these projects are something that can be done in a couple days, but some of these projects will typically take even a team of 4 a few months to do, and I am doing this solo. And he assumes that because Development is required for it, that our dev team knows about it, and they don't know anything about my job either, nor do they care. They are software developers, they do something completely different.  \n\n\nSo now I'm at this point where because some of these things aren't getting done as fast as my boss thinks they should get done and he's constantly mad at me. He has me in charge of so many different things and projects that it's hard to keep up. I've tried telling him that I'm overwhelmed and his response was just \"We're all stretched thin right now.\" And at this point, I'm working 12+ hour shifts per day just to try and keep up and not getting paid any extra because I was told that I can't get overtime. So in order to not lose my job, I'm working so many extra hours and stressing so much. My boss even has me sending him weekly summaries of everything that I do during the week because he thinks I'm not doing anything at all.  \n\n\nWould it be a bad career move to ask my boss to juts go back to being a System Administrator? We're already at a point where my automation is kind of crucial in our processes, but this is too much stress and I feel like I'm constantly screwing up because he stays mad at me for something beyond my control. And he doesn't understand what all goes into my job. Not to mention, I get paid about 25k less than a very low end Junior DevOps Engineer, and I'm doing Senior DevOps Engineer work. The typical pay for what I am doing is at bare minimum about 40k more than I am making now. I didn't get any kind of pay raise when I got swapped to DevOps Engineer, so I'm not sure if that's something I can even ask for. The other problem is, he's already hired other guys to fill the System Administrator position since I was kind of moving away from that type of work. Just not sure what to do in this situation.",

I got a bachelors degree in computer science from a top university, and have been working as a software engineer for 9 years. I'm a pretty smart guy but I also have ADHD. I got through school doing the bare minimum, never studying, and doing well enough on tests through sheer intellect. But in the real world that hasn't cut it. I'm on my fifth job now. I was fired from two of the other four within a year for poor performance and laid off from a third. I managed to hold one job for five years, but I was a bottom performer and only stuck around because I had a very undemanding boss.

The internet is simply too irresistible of a distraction. No matter how much I push myself or stress myself out, it just doesn't work. Neither does medication.So I'm thinking maybe it's time to accept reality and try something else. I really don't think I'll be able to cut it at any job that requires sitting in front of a computer all day.

And it just seems like worthwhile, important work.\n\nI'm about to schedule a ride along with my local PD, but I wanted to get some other opinions too. So what would you do if you were me?

    "text": "Urgently Need Help: Battling ADHD Struggles in Engineering, any advice? \n\nHey Reddit,\n\nThis is a throwaway. I want to share my wild ride through engineering with ADHD. Since 4th grade, I've been dreaming of being an engineer – inspired by Myth Busters and Lego robotics. It's the ONLY thing I've wanted to be for as long as I remember. High school was a success, but my struggle to focus on all classes led me to Adderall. It helped me excel, secure a full ride to college, and even ace AP classes.\n\nIn college, though, the rollercoaster began. Engineering's complexities made me feel like I was battling a strong current. Adderall became my lifeline, but it came at a cost – insomnia and dependency. Late nights in the lab became the norm as I wrestled ADHD's impact on my studies.\n\nNavigating isolation as the only black man in the program was tough. But connecting with classmates facing similar challenges created a lifeline. Study groups became my refuge where I could openly share my struggles.\n\nA game-changing moment was our capstone project – designing an unmanned aircraft system. I poured my hyperfocus into the project, adapting strategies to manage my time and focus better. The validation and excitement I felt when we presented it were unlike anything else.\n\nWhile I didn't graduate right away due to heavy workload, I found a data science internship, worked a few jobs, and tutored computer science part-time. Unfortunately, the full-time job didn't stick, and now I'm unemployed, feeling like a failure. The FE exam proved tough, and finding a job in my field seems impossible. I'm feeling like my hard work was for nothing and I'm not cut out for this engineering shit.\n\nSo, fellow Redditors, if you've faced similar situations, I'd love to hear your advice.\n\nTL;DR: Struggled with ADHD and isolation in engineering as a black man. Found support from peers and adapted strategies. Succeeded in capstone, graduated, worked but currently unemployed. Seeking advice to overcome challenges and find direction.",

My job has become mundane to a point where I just browse reddit all day, do random google searches and watch YouTube. I've worked here for 4 years and I'm jaded to say the least. The job has become too easy since I've realized that the management here is aloof and unambitious so it permeates the whole work culture, also I've become more experienced at the company so I know how to move things around faster than most people; so I just wait till the last minute to complete things, and nothing feels intrinsically rewarding anymore. Dealing with annoying customers and their concerns is really not my skill set and that's what my job has become. I was voluntold for this job since my previous department was not doing well. I don't care about making a difference and I've been doing the absolute bare minimum - responding to emails and occasionally initiating actions, other than that I barely even leave my desk; only to pee or use the microwave to heat my lunch and when I go home.\r  \n\r  \nYesterday I was literally watching a 30 minutes YouTube video today during work hours and nobody seemed to care. I've reached new heights of apathy regarding work. There are coworkers that have Amazon prime subscriptions and watch full movies in a small window on their screens during work hours. I used to think that was unusual and disrespectful to others but I'm pretty much heading in the same direction.\r  \n\r  \nBut I'm still grateful for the fact that I still have a job that pays the bills with some money to spare, but man do I feel empty and aimless. My career is going nowhere and I spend more time reading and posting on reddit than understanding my job or trying to do better. And in this economic condition it's extremely hard to find another job. It's just so demoralizing to work in this office that hasn't been renovated in probably 50 years. I just come in for the attendance, pretend to work 8 hours while having finished my work in 2 hours and slouch in my chair for the rest of the time. My 9-5 office job is a limbo. I already have a degree in Mechanical Engineering but my career is stuck in a rut, and I am not doing any Engineering work. I wish I had a mentor because I'm lost.\n\nWorked here 4 years, promoted once and made 2 lateral moves. Is this indication that I should change my job? Or should I start looking a different career path?",

    "text": "How should navigate this \"you are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master\" situation? I'm a software dev with a PhD in CS and over 15 years of industry experience. Six years ago, I applied for an engineering lead position at my current company. Due to a very unique hiring situation, I ended up with the title of senior engineer instead of lead. However, my manager and I worked out an arrangement where I received the pay and benefits of a lead despite the title discrepancy. Yes, I have confirmed this from two VPs who have moved companies but independently shared the detailed pay bands with me before they left.  Due to my company's annual performance-based pay increases that are multiplicative (and that my salary/equity/bonus was already an administrative override in the budget), I'm currently earning the same compensation of a principal engineer.\n\nI'm seeking advice because I desire a change for growth reasons after being on my current team for so long. My company doesn't do traditional promotions, you need to apply for a position elsewhere in the company when there is an opening in order to effectively get a promotion.  However, my applying for a lead position would mean a significant pay cut due to resetting the pay band, so I can only realistically apply as a principal engineer, which leadership really dislikes skip-level promotions too.\n\nI've thought about leaving the company, but given my plans to retire early and my current portfolio + equity vesting in my current company, it would require a signing bonus so extreme to compensate for the equity I would be leaving behind, it is unlikely to happen. I'm also concerned that at some point due to all the layoffs in tech, that some efficiency consultant is going to come along and see me getting paid more than $100k over my title's pay band and see a great opportunity to trim the fat.  There's also an ickiness because I'm a man overseeing the work of two female engineers and getting paid more than them even though I'm a lower title.  Although I have the education, experience, and am doing the job of a principal engineer, and both of the female engineers are younger, have lower degrees, less experience, etc... it feels bad because people outside my team have commented on the optics of it when they see it on org charts.\n\nI'm looking for guidance on navigating this situation, thanks.",

    "text": "Should I become a pilot? Or wait for Revature and the tech industry to sort itself out? Need to Rubberduck some career options, thanks in advance!\n\nI suppose it isn’t true rubberducking since I’m hoping for help, but close enough and it’s a fun term, so here we go. \n\nI’m currently in the middle of a divorce AND a major career transition and need some help. You see, I’ve been a high school math teacher for years, but it’s become unsustainable and I decided to leave the profession. Teachers are not respected or paid very well in Arizona, and finding out that my friend stocking Walmart shelves made the same paychecks I did (with a masters degree and half a decade at the school) was the last straw. \n\nTo keep it short, after a couple months of research I decided to transition into software engineering. Passed Revature’s RevUp program and got offered a contract, start time a couple months out. Totally doable right? Well it probably would have been, but Elon Musk started the whole twitter debacle in the meantime and the whole tech industry has been shaken up, so my start date has been pushed back indefinitely and I am scrambling for options. Here we go:\n\nOption 1: wait for Revature - Revature is basically a tech employment agency. They get members up to speed on the industry and provide entry points into it, in exchange for a 12-18 month contract where they, I’m sure, make their money back. But the more pressing matter is that my start date is currently indefinitely postponed and I can’t just wait around forever and hope it still happens. But it IS an option. \n\nOption 2: Education 2.0 - I have since moved to a new state, one that pays teachers better and treats them *better*. It’s far from perfect as it’s expensive to live, but giving teaching a second shot is an easy option to get into, as transitioning my license won’t be much work or money. I just don’t think I’ll stick with it long term because education chews up teachers like nothing and it already burnt me out once. With a more peaceful home life though, it might be doable. \n\nOption 3: Aviation - I have my private pilot’s certificate already, though it isn’t current at the moment, and aviation is very much something I enjoy. I know there are currently impressive reimbursement programs as airlines scramble to find enough pilots (supposedly), but that’s what they said about teachers too, and you see where that got me. I’m hesitant, but the only reason I didn’t pursue aviation before was because I didn’t have the money to break into it. It’s an expensive career to start. \n\nOption 4: Drone Aviation - much lower cost of entry, but far fewer jobs from what I can tell. It would take me nothing to get my class 107 licensing and become a commercial drone pilot, but jobs seem to be few and far between, as it’s high niche, low skill, so while an easy option to try, this likely isn’t viable. \n\nSo there you have it. I’m looking for general advice and for career field specific advice if anyone has it. I’m honestly heavily considering aviation but it’s still such a damn high monetary risk, and I owe more than I borrowed for my teaching degree already. Getting stuck with two student loans I couldn’t pay off would drive me off the deep end. But man, flying for a living sounds amazing, even if it’s 50% paperwork and politics. Haha.

    "text": "Should I quit? And how? Just like the title says.  So the backstory is I’ve been at this job for 13 years.  I’m on metal fabrication and I do cnc programming.  While I was there I finished an associates in electro-mechanical engineering and thought I could get promoted with a degree.  They gave me a $1.50/hr raise for it back in 2018 but not in the conversation for advancing.  During Covid I got pretty burnt out and slowly quite quitting some days for the most part.  I was always above and beyond my responsibilities and considered it my job for every facet of the job from keeping people busy to making sure orders go out smoothly and on time.  \n\nIn November I decided to go back to school for my bachelor’s in industrial engineering since Covid opened up a lot of majors online.  I’ve worked under 3 different and all of them loved me.  The 3rd one wasn’t loved by one guy in the office that wanted that job and basically talked crap about him till they ran him off and he took the job slowly.  He took over probably July last year.  He started slowly not going through me but to my coworker that I trained and cut me out of a lot of things.  So much so my coworker though he was going to take over.  \n\nI got frustrated so going back to school seemed like a good idea.  In December I talked to the plant manager, since I was going back to school and we were getting a new machine that would triple our output, about a new titled lead man position or supervisor since it was only implied I was over the department.  \n\nI was told that they had been begging another guy to take the position for years but he never would.  In the same conversation he said there wouldn’t be a titled person over that area.  My quite quitting stepped up a notch but also no one talked to me about anything in regards to my dept and I felt like I was being ran off. \n\n2 things go bad since I wasn’t part of checking prints anymore and I got blamed for programming too much and not staying on tops of it.  They took away my desk and gave me a standup desk.  Then he made his friend that had been there 9 months the lead man.  \n\nHe knows nothing about the machines, product, or inventory.  Basically got a promotion so they could sit in the office and talk it seems like. \n\nMy wife wants me to quit she makes triple what I make.  but I’m having difficulty doing it since it’s a small town and I make good money but I might not find another job making that much until I graduate December 2024 hopefully.  2 kids and a newborn.  But It’s not what I want to do the rest of my life, hence the degree.  \n\nJust need some advice on how to quit and let the owner know what happened or just how to turn in a resignation.  \n\nPlease advise",

    "text": "Good job, but no upward mobility? Would you leave a good job if it meant you could (pprobably) advance your career?\n\n\nI checked the rules to be sure this is allowed but for transparency, I am posting for my partener who does not use reddit. I'm just an artist so please excuse my overuse of laymen's terms.\n\n\nMy partner is an electrical engineer with a relatively good job, which he's had for years. Small company that can't pay what he's worth, BUT he gets work he mostly enjoys and absolutely adores most of his coworkers, besides a few bad apples. Sub-par pay for what he does, like I said, but great benefits. That, and his boss freaking LOVES him. \n\n\nHis biggest issue with this company is that there's nowhere to go within it. His current title would likely be his title for a decade or longer because of how to tiny this company is, there's just no need for more tiers of management. One man manages the whole EE department AND works on the same projects they are working on. There's just nothing to promote him *to.*\n\n\nHis smaller (but still important to him) issue is that the work is kind of... I'd say adjacent to what he really wants to do. He DOES like his specific niche and he's good at it, but it's not what he invisions himself doing. The other day, one of his coworkers on the shop floor had asked him if his work was difficult. He said \"probably,\" and his coworker elaborated \"is it difficult FOR YOU?\" My partner's immediate answer was \"no\" and this made him so sad.\n\n\nHe has been tossing around the idea of looking around for a out a year now, but whenever a project he's interested in comes along he tossed that aside and goes all in on that until he realizes this one's just the same as it always is, and he becomes unhappy again. \n\n\nI told him I've heard that people who make a lot of good advancement in their careers usually do it by leaving their job every 2-5 years, and using their experience to make their resume look nice and land a better position, rather than working up to one in a company that's not promoting. I've also told him that he doesn't need to be thankful that things aren't worse, and it's okay to want better for yourself. Yes, it is a very decent job, especially in this economic climate, but there is no harm in looking around and maybe finding something better, that can pay him fairly, that makes him happier. He doesn't have to quit to do that!\n\n\nWe just aren't sure that it's the right choice, staying or leaving. We both struggle with big changes and as a freelancer, I really don't know much about advancing within a company, or within your career, to be confident with the advice he's looking for. So, career men and women of Reddit, would YOU be willing to take a blind step into a new job not knowing if it will truly be better? Or should we hold on to the good thing we have and hope things change?",

Apologies in advance if this gets long.\n\nI'm almost 32, graduated in 2013 with a bullshit degree not worth the paper its printed on. For the sake of brevity, suffice it to say I never really entered my field of study and can't really do it now (again, useless degree) and have no desire to (any jobs I'd get, which don't really exist to begin with, I'd be lucky to make $40k/yr). \n\nI wound up being self employed for many of the intervening years, only broke $20k once. Then out of the blue due to a networking connection, I was plucked from obscurity after losing half my annual revenue in accounts in the span of two weeks and started a real estate-adjacent job making a $30k salary which felt like becoming a  millionaire overnight. Fast forward a few years, my boss left to start his own company and took me with him as his second in command after quickly becoming very good at the work we did. I went from $30k to $70k inclusive of bonuses/commissions, again, overnight. Then the inflation/interest rate hike started at the beginning of last year and got progressively worse to the point where, because of those things combined with a severe lack of housing inventory in my area, I got laid off late October of last year. My boss is now living off of credit cards and a HELOC, the company we left closed completely, and every other company in my area that does what I did is also hemorrhaging money and laying off people left and right. \n\nI am at a complete loss for what to do next. Fortunately my wife is a nurse and can pick up overtime, but 1, I don't feel right asking that of her and 2, she is borderline disabled and can barely survive her three shifts a week as it is. I feel like I have absolutely no marketable skills due to useless degree that I have no experience using after 10 years and my industry being unlikely to recover until the end of next year at the soonest.\n\nMy one strength is that I learn very quickly, but besides that I have no real skills to offer. I am to the point where I am considering doing what I should have done out of high school and going to school for engineering like my old man, but the thought of going back to school with recently diagnosed ADD, into a field I was awful at in high school (I suck at math beyond explanation), after the experience of being sold a false bill of goods by my first college, AND not being able to make an income for several years makes me ill to even think about. \n\nI am painfully awkward around the general public and have too many ethics to get into sales. I am very technically minded and have a knack for the trades, but after several injuries in my 20s I fear I don't have the body for it anymore. My area has fatal accidents daily, so I am not looking to do much commuting. PLUS I have a $70k/yr salary worth of expenses, an almost 3yo daughter, a house so small my wife and I are constantly at each other's throats, and as I said, no reasonable path out of my situation that I can see. My unemployment runs out literally this week and then my ass is flapping in the breeze.\n\nTLDR- for all intents and purposes, no degree. Only solid skills are in a career that the current economy has decimated, and an income level I see no way of replacing. \n\nLocated in Lehigh Valley PA if that helps anyone. Thanks for whatever advice you can give.",

So after some long research I decided that becoming a Sonographer would be a great fit with it having so many benefits that a lot of trades offer with an addition of being a very clean and high paying trade with little to no debt after completing school. \nBenefits of this career would be a very high paying hourly wage with little school and very limited debt. I would be able to work anywhere in the country with many options to work whenever I want. Very clean setting with hopefully nice people to work around with in a hospital or clinical setting. \nCons, there don’t seem to be many other than having the same job title throughout your career but you can choose different niches to work in. \n\nMy second option was to become a engineer of some sort because I’ve always been good at problem solving and creating things with my hands which is something I never realized until my teacher pointed it out to me after I completed several construction projects being the top student during those assignments. Only downside to this path is that it’s much longer and has more stressful school work and all the debt that comes with it. Debt is a major factor that I really don’t want to occur much of. I’m also mid at math and it has always been a stressful subject for me. I would basically have to restart from the very beginning since I’ve lost so much brain storage for the subject over the years too, which could lead me to stay in school longer with more debt as well. \nBenefits would be completing a bachelors or even a masters which is always a plus. High paying career with many options to choose and bounce around jobs later on. Seems to be a very fulfilling experience. Lots of clout of having a title of an engineer. And the ability to transfer skills to everyday home tasks.\nCons, longer years in school and most likely will have lots of debt after leaving school. My exes dad was an electrical engineer and I remember that man working very long hours and always being stressed out. I deal with a lot of stress already with personal problems and this aspect kinda scares me because I don’t want anymore of it. \n\nWhich ever career i choose, ideally would just be a job and not a life long career until I can invest more money into what I actually want to do which is to open up my own business. Opening a Gym and selling Tshirts have always been something I wanted to do but I know the reality of owning a business can be a very risky venture so I would like to have a good backup option. \n\nMy plans as of right now are to just work full time and go to school starting spring semester with very limited room for hobbies and going out until I’m completely done.",

    "text": "Senior Software Architect - Thinking I want to go back to being a feature developer. Am I nuts? Hello, all.\n\nI've been in the professional software development space for about the last 15 years. I'm in my early mid 40s now. I found myself promoted to the role of software architect at my large, well known Fortune 500 company about 7 years ago - and then to Principal Senior Software Architect about 5 years ago.\n\nHaving grown tired of the bureaucracy of such a large company, and having also tired of what felt like non-stop daily meetings, I decided to leave for other opportunities.\n\nI now find myself acting as the senior software architect for a very large medical service company, and I find myself struggling to sign on just about every day.\n\nI've been reflecting quite a bit lately on what it is that's making me so down on things professionally, and the best that I can come up with is 1 part textbook burnout resulting from a never ending stream of tasks and people that urgently need my time (usually on things I don't feel are nearly as urgent as they do), and 1 part just not enjoying the roles and responsibilities of a 'software architect'.\n\nI've gathered that arguably pointless meetings are part of most companies, but I've also experienced where this is especially true for the architect - as every department head and stakeholder feels important enough and entitled enough to have the architect weigh in on their needs, even when it's adding a new upload CSV button to their web app. I'm also expected to right the wrongs of those who came before me - \"We understand this isn't really architecture, but we need to ensure we get it right this time, which is why we decided to bring you in on this\". Sure, it's flattering - but it's also exhausting.\n\nI've also felt my positions as an architect to be poorly defined at both companies, leading me to question if this is just the path of software architect - as both companies similarly expect that I'm an expert level \"Jack of all trades, Master of all\", and so want my input on essentially everything inside and outside of my specific area/department.\n\nI also find an expectation that I step into unfamiliar solutions and just be capable of crafting detailed architectural diagrams and documentation effortlessly, which isn't an effortless task, in the least, for me - and is something that I don't particularly enjoy or feel that I'm particularly good at.\n\nI get 'lent out' a lot for special urgent projects with other teams, which is stressful as everyone just expects that I have some super power to automatically know everything in every domain, including the ones I have zero experience or exposure to - which usually results in me working ridiculously long hours for months on end to both get up to speed on this new thing, while also struggling to hold together things with my regular teams and projects.\n\nThere is essentially no 'down time'. When end of year code freezes and the sort come around, and my team is talking about how good it is to finally get a break and to get some early afternoons, I'm pretty   \n much always assigned some special project that's \"super important\" to the execs, so that I can get a jump on it. Of course, this requires I just continue to work 50+hr weeks throughout Christmas and New Year holidays. This, too, has happened at both companies - which leads me to conclude this is just kind of the norm...\n\nNo one really seems to understand what a software architect does, or perhaps it's me that's confused. I felt like my first company did a better job on this front, as aside from the meetings (which I know are often part of the architect's responsibilities), I did primarily architect and engineer (greenfield) solutions - though I felt I acted 60% as an engineer here (architecting the solution, getting sign off on it, then doing the bulk of implementing it myself or with a small team). But the newer company has basically indicated that their expectation for an architect is to know anything and everything about their business so that I can act in some god-like mode, fully informed of every fiber of reality concerning their domain, in order to architect the best solution possible for them. I'm also the technical team lead. I am also expected to act somewhat as an HR manager for my direct resources. I'm expected to have long, intimate sit downs with executive level people and owners to discuss their latest and 'greatest' hair brain idea of how they're going to revolutionize the industry using AI and how they'd like me to, on the side, spearhead their project with zero time and zero budget ASAP.\n\nIt's just exhausting, I'm struggling, and I feel like it's affecting my well being in such a negative manner that it bleeds over into all other personal aspects of my life.\n\nSo... I find myself longing for the days when I showed up, checked Jira, and started working on implementing a ticket in code based on the gathered requirements, often not really needing to understand much of anything about the business domain of the product or why the feature was requested. Life seemed so much simpler and more clearly defined back then. Back then, I only had a couple regularly scheduled daily meetings. Back then, I knew what I did day to day - because that was nailed down in sprint planning and was assigned directly to me. I still was empowered to do non-coding things that I enjoy, such as mentoring juniors, or participating in technical steering discussions - but I wasn't expected to do so with absolute authority and completely solo as I am today.\n\nOf course, there's the topic of compensation... As a senior software architect, I make about 50% more than I likely would as a senior level engineer. There are also extra compensation perks, such as allocated shares, that come along with a principal level role that generally don't with the engineer positions. But I just find myself feeling that these 'perks' just aren't worth the additional cost to me - I find myself thinking that I'd rather just clock in someplace for 140k rather than doing what I'm doing for 220k...\n\nAm I nuts? \n\nAm I just burnt out and should be looking to address that while staying the course as an architect? \n\nAm I dreaming that I can ever go back? I have, on a whim, applied for a number of senior software engineer roles, and I find myself getting few calls back - and usually those calls go something like \"Did you mean to apply for our open architectural role? Because with your many years of experience as an architect, we believe you'd be a better fit there.\".\n\nAnd then there's the market. Man, has the process of landing a new gig changed quite a bit over the last decade. When I first got in the field, it seemed as if there was no shortage of need, though there was a shortage of talent - apply to a few and get a call back from a couple, \"when can you start?\". The last time I beat the pavement aggressively, I found myself getting a lot of follow ups, doing rounds of interviews over the course of a month, doing the dreaded coding challenges requiring significant time and investment, only to get an eventual follow up that the opening had been eliminated due to budget constraints or internal realignments (which I figure has something to do with the position of architect more than engineer, somewhat related to salary and high level operational nature of the position and how it's often viewed somewhat as a management role).\n\nSo I sit here, once again watching the sun rise, dreading to sign on, while I scroll through postings on LinkedIn, asking ChatGPT for career advice, contemplating revamping my resume to eliminate all traces of 'Architect' and to highlight my accomplishments as an in-the-code engineer.\n\nHave any of you gone through this? And recommendations on how to right this ship? Anyone transition from architect to engineer and conclude \"I made the right choice\"?\n\nAny input is appreciated.",

When I was hired for my current job, the job title that was posted was \"Java application developer\". During my interview, I was asked a series of programming questions, no technical tests though. After being hired, I was told my job title was \"Technology Analyst\", and I started learning things like ocp4, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Splunk, etc. My day-to-day seems to resemble that of a person in a dev-ops role, but to a lesser degree. I'm basically the middle-man between the business and the dev side, where I communicate with DBAs to run scripts, and just copy-paste deployment image names given by the dev team into Jenkins to carry out code deployments. There's some monitoring that happens afterwards in OpenShift, but other than that, my job duties seem to be just \"whatever needs to be done, or email x to figure out how y needs to be done\". I do on rare occasions get some simple development work handed to me though, which usually includes writing simple service calls to an API, or creating SQL queries to verify a data load. \n\nRecently I was talking to a friend who had a very similar experience. She said the job she applied for was a C# developer role, but when being hired on, she was told her job like customer success engineer or something like that, which was basically a no-coding role, except for the occasional SQL queries. \n\nI'm just wondering, is this a common thing that happens in the industry? My job pays well and the benefits are great so I haven't really considered changing jobs any time soon, I just worry that my lack of programming work at my current job will make it more difficult to find a dev job down the road.",

This entire year I was obsessed with getting ahead again so I grinded at work and grinded outside of work by practicing leet code, trying to make a mobile app, formulating business ideas, working for my friends start up(which ended because he would not pay me), going to career fairs, and now deciding to start a masters degree this coming year. All the while I am slated for a promotion this coming March at work. Yet still I feel like I am falling behind. \n\nI think that I should have instead started my own business venture by now or gotten an interview with a big tech company but non of that panned out so far. Looking towards 2024 it seems like I will be working my current job and doing the masters program but that timeline will be for the next two years minimum. I have this feeling that I am falling behind. people I know that are starting their own businesses or already landing jobs in Big tech all of which make me feel like I need to be doing something more. I feel like if I don’t keep working hard I’m going to be left behind but I already feel like I work all the time. Should I just trust the processs, will something unexpected happen, is this a common sentiment in CS?\n\nNot to mention we are at the advent of AI and I have the feeling that if I don’t do something with AI then I am basically a cave man.",

    "text": "I'm really desperate to switch from Salesforce to mainstream tech. I'm sorry if this post comes off as a rant.\n\nTLDR; working with Salesforce is a pain in the ass and I'm really desperate to switch tech stack and company because of propritary platform and low pay.\n\n**A bit of background:**\n\nI have been working as a Software Engineer in a propritary platform (Salesforce Commerce Cloud or Salesforce B2C Commerce or SFRA) for 2 years in India. This is my first job in this company.\n\nI never wanted to work as a SF developer however I was desparate for experience back then, you know the phrase \"You need a job to get experience, you need experience to get a job\"\n\nGaining experience was the single most crucial thing for me; however, in hindsight, I should never have been so hasty.\n\n**Rant / The problem with Salesforce:**\n\nWorking in Saleforce is a real pain in the ass, you need sandboxes/servers to upload your code and to run it, way too legacy code, proprietary languages, too much focus on the configurations and setup and less focus on code, way too third party integration services, certs and nonsense that get you locked in, XML's in this day, documentation with zero or few examples which leads me to beg people to ask about how in the world this shit works.\n\nTo top it off, the local sandboxes that you use as a developer are really slow compared to the primary ones that goes by the names development, staging and production environment. Every page load and button click for some reason is a form submit action which takes 5 - 10 seconds to load a single pages on local.\n\nWhenever I say I work as a Salesforce developer to my friends in tech I always get a response like \"Salesforce? what are you selling? are you working as in sales team or something?\" or \"Salesforce? nah man I don't know anything about it\" or \"Salesforce is not real software engineering\", this is the reason why I don't mention Salesforce in phone screens to the recruiter I just say I work in so-so tech stack.\n\n**Current situation and mental health:**\n\nThe current market has made it even worse for me to transition into mainstram tech. Everyday I sit for work I get anxiety, and I feel like I'm slowly losing my sanity and motivation day by day.\n\nI asked my manager to switch teams to React but they simply tried to convince me to stick to Salesforce. Their primary point was that it's a very niche tech with less competition. Their now encouraging me to learn Salesforce Data Cloud which I'm very reluctant to do.\n\n**The Pay:**\n\nYou might be wondering that just because it's a very niche tech and there are few people who are willing to work on it, the pay will be good. It turns out that's not true. It's absolutely true that hiring an experienced developer would be too costly, but most companies can't afford to pay that much so they just transfer experienced employees to the Salesforce team or hire freshers to give them training on Salesforce (this is how I was hired).\n\nI would have been able to go on for a while if the pay wasn't a problem; unfortunately, I have gotten no pay raise whatsoever here (which is the reason why I'm so desperate to switch companies and the tech stack). I asked my manager about the pay raise, and they simply blamed it on the job market and layoffs, even though I have never seen salary issues among my friends in other companies. I messaged HR about the pay, but she simply ignored it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: most people have been overlooking the fact that I work in Saleforce Commerce Cloud now known as Salesforce B2C Commerce (or SFRA), is a cloud-based e-commerce platform that enables businesses to create and manage online storefronts. It is part of the Salesforce Customer 360 platform, which offers a suite of tools for managing customer relationships, sales, and marketing.\n\nUpdate: I quit my job without anything lined up. Not the best move in this current market but I'll be taking time off to improve my skills and work upon myself and hopefully in the near future I hope I'll be able to work with someone and something that I'm happy with.",

    "text": "Follow up to my post about being unexpectedly PIP'd at a startup So two months ago, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12c47y8/my_boss_at_a_startup_suddenly_told_me_in_a_11_im/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about getting blindsided by my then-CTO at the startup I was working at. Thought I would provide an update, since the story ended up having a happy ending, as well as some lessons I learned along the way.\n\nThe job search took about a month, and early on I got a reaaaaaalllly lowball offer for 91k base (no I'm not joking, this is why I usually ignore CO-based companies, their pay is trash), which was very tempting to take. Ultimately I passed on it and ended up getting an offer as a data engineer at a fast-growing, tech-focused F500 company with 115k base, 10% bonus, and 30k RSUs vested evenly over 3 years for about 135k TC. Not too far off what I was making, and in all fairness, this company will probably accelerate my career trajectory so much more than another no name startup that will almost certainly fail within a couple years.\n\nFor those of you job hunting right now due to layoffs, or otherwise, here's what I learned. The reality is that most companies are behaving like absolute trash right now, because they can afford to, which is taking the form of offering contract only or making very low offers. The interviewing bar seems to be very high right now too. I did about 60 or so LC problems, which still didn't seem like enough, but the problem is they always seem to give you a problem that's dissimilar from what you've already worked on. I get that we're supposed to work on patterns, not problems, but when it's a pattern you haven't worked on yet or aren't strong in eh....best I can offer is to just grind more problems. Plenty of good advice in this subreddit about that.\n\nAs far as the job hunting itself goes, contract or not, I followed up on any reasonable outreach. Recruiters were typical recruiters, so expect a lot of ghosting, no surprise there. I marked myself as open to work, and made a post about being laid off, and surprisingly got a decent amount of direct recruiter contacts via DMs which were much higher quality. I think this is going to be very dependent on your network, and the size of it, but if you don't have a lot of connections on LinkedIn this may be one of those instances where it will pay off later because more people saw, shared, and commented on my looking for work post than they otherwise would have if I had a smaller network. Cold applications were almost completely worthless. I don't think anything material about my job search would have changed if I didn't make any cold applications, and just waited for recruiters to DM me, which is nuts but oh well.\n\nI also was able to successfully file for unemployment, since the startup couldn't prove they fired me for cause which in CO if you're fired for cause then you can't get unemployment, which isn't particularly shocking since they just made up a reason to get rid of me. Surprisingly, unemployment didn't even ding me for turning down the job offer, since it was so much lower than what market rate was. However, I did get denied for my final week of being unemployed, because apparently even if you accept a job offer and you're just waiting to start, you can't get unemployment if you didn't make work search activities like applying to jobs. So keep that in mind if you're trying to maintain unemployment. Granted, this is for CO, but even if you're in another state I'd just apply to a few jobs each week while waiting to start just in case. This may be the only use for cold applications since they're an easy way to report work search activities.\n\nLastly for career stuff in general...this sub, Blind, etc. really preaches job hopping for more pay. While I appreciate that, and I still am in a better position than I was staying at my first company making 85k as a mid level developer, man it's been a stressful ride. I would definitely not move right now for money, and in general, I would balance job hopping for more pay vs. the stress / hassle of interviews and then maybe having your offer rescinded, getting laid off, etc. in your first week or getting the manager from hell. I definitely would never, ever, EVER consider startups. Even if you can jump for a huge TC bump, like 30%+, I would balance that against whether you're happy in your current role and whether you need the money. 30% more at 85k is life changing whereas at 150k you may not care that much unless you live in a very expensive area.\n\nIf you're looking right now, wish you the best of luck, and hang in there. If you're not getting some recruiter DMs, try the open to work banner or making a post. If you're not getting a lot of phone screens and/or interviews after DMs, grow suspicious of your resume, and see what you can do about improving it. There's a light at the end of the tunnel!",

He has no critical thinking or problem solving abilities at all. I've shown him many times how to use google search, I ask him \"why do you think the solution is <thing that doesn't make any sense>?\" and try to work through it with him, but he doesn't get it. He doesn't get anything. Even when I just figure out what to do on my own and complete the task, he fails to copy-paste things over correctly. And god help us if a path is incorrect. \n\nThe manager is avoids difficult discussions. He acknowledges that this guy is spare parts, but is unwilling/unable to do anything about it.

That saves many hours counteracts a large fraction of the increased working hours.\n\nThe only real difficulty is being away from home. \n\nI think the reason people complain about how grueling the job is is because they want people to feel bad for them, or they don’t understand what a normal work life looks like for someone that’s motivated.\n\nJust my $0.02. Everyone says AP is the worst position at the firm, so maybe my tune will be different next year.",

    "text": "How do I stay resilient when faced with racism at work? I'm writing this because it's still at the forefront of my mind, I can feel my fight or flight engaged because I'm still rattled. \n\nI'm an almost 30s engineering PhD student with some months left to finish and I'm so excited because whilst it's been a wonderful journey, lord I'm tired! Anyway a couple days ago I'm out with some colleagues, from several different departments, my closest friend and I had made some new buddies recently so decided to bring them along to meet everyone else for a drink. I come from the south but study in the north of the UK and have gotten used to the fact that I am usually the only black woman in any situation involving academia, it's lonely but I get by. One of these new \"friends\" decided to begin the n-word chat and why he should be able to say it; the skin on the back of my neck tenses and I brace for battle, something I despise doing because I'm not good at it. I just wanted an evening to unwind at the end of a hard week and now I'm on edge, I can feel the misery setting in.\n\nUnlike many situations I'd been in before where people felt comfortable enough to spill all their problematic BS about this, this guy felt bold enough to actually use the word. I was so shocked because he kept saying it, I tried to argue my points as to why he shouldn't but I was cornered and I felt so heated I was struggling to get my words out; I felt so alone. My best friend/colleague was elsewhere so I only had a couple people around me backing me up. But honestly having back up didn't matter, this man was on a mission to enrage me, and he was winning. \n\nHe's french btw and this is important because I speak the language and am well aware that many of them have the same sentiments, not all, but enough. It's so unfortunate because the language is so beautiful to me but the people, sheesh! For me, the point at which you start saying the word just to piss me off \"pretending\" you're trying to make a point, well, that there is the literal definition of racism, he'd massively crossed the line. Oh and it wasn't just pejorative terms towards black people, also Jewish people, LGBTQ+ people, anyone could get it as far as he was concerned. It was about \"humour\" and we were all \"snowflakes\". I had to pinch myself, was I in a pub or at home reading YouTube comments?! It was wild! I told him if that's so why is nobody laughing, clearly you're not very funny. \n\nI know I'm going to be in this situation again, not necessarily with him but definitely some other wretched goon on a mission to provoke. What actions can I take so I don't become so flustered, I know I can't change their minds, some of these people are so privileged I'm surprised they're not defecating gold coins. But how can I hold myself? I've been rewatching interviews with Dr Angelou; she's the person I go to when I feel like screaming into the void, despondent. My grandma from another mother. I wish I had her patience, her fortitude, but I know it's okay to get angry too.",

    "text": "Debunking the \"Gender Pay Gap\" Copied from the [original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TraditionalMuslims/comments/14p3dwq/debunking_the_gender_pay_gap/).\n\nSo I didn't think I needed to debunk this as it's been done a million times before. However, it's come to my attention that apparently some still believe it. So, just to have an easy-to-reference, codified treatise on the issue, I'm writing this piece to utterly decimate this commonly propagated liberal trope.\n\nMainstream media presents [articles like this](https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-wage-pay-gap-charts-2017-3) that claim there is a pay gap between men and women, and that it's on the sole basis of gender. While it is true that men tend to earn more money than women, it is absolutely false that it's due to gender bias in favor of men (if anything, it's actually in favor of women). The problem with the statistics shown is that they only take into account median yearly salaries without accounting for any other confounding variables that may be skewing the data. For example, if I told you that the more people drown the more often ice cream is sold, would you take that to mean that ice cream causes people to drown? No, you'd probably say that it's because of ice cream sales increasing in the summer when it's hot, which is simultaneously when people go swimming more, thereby increasing the likelihood of drownings to happen; this shared commonality (i.e. the heat) is a confounding variable.\n\nFor the so-called \"gender pay gap\", here are the confounding variables:\n\n1. This statistic does not account for what types of jobs are being worked, as **men choose higher-paying jobs**.\n   * [*Source 1.*](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.1120.0757) *Demonstrates how women choose different jobs than men because they value and/or prioritize different things than men (e.g. better work-life balance). Because of this, the jobs they prefer tend to be lower-paying.*\n   * [*Source 2.*](https://academic.oup.com/oep/article-abstract/57/3/479/2361925?redirectedFrom=fulltext) *Same as Source 1, but also found that \"job satisfaction of men increases with additional earnings while that of women does not\" (p. 486).*\n   * [*Source 3.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719) *Landmark study; displays evidence that men choose higher-paying jobs. The more egalitarian/feminist a country is, the fewer women choose careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (i.e. traditionally male-dominated roles). Giving greater career choice to women increases (apparent) gender disparities within the workforce.*\n   * [*Source 4.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2525981) *Cited over 11,600 times. Demonstrated very directly that women choose jobs that are lower-paying, and that women are NOT being paid less to do equal work; and this was in 1973, almost 50 years ago. Please note that any discrimination found thereafter is really just residual unaccounted variability rather than actual discrimination per se, as detailed in the conclusion.*\n   * [*Source 5.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243210361475) *So ignoring the ideological bullshit that's indirectly being pushed, it demonstrates clearly that women choose different jobs than men and that it is solely due to their own choice; and that the only time women don't choose traditionally female jobs over male jobs is when they're essentially forced to take the male job.*\n      * *Interestingly enough, this supports the findings of* [*this study here*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719) *(which was a MASSIVE, catastrophic blow to the \"men and women are equal but female oppression and gender discrimination are the only reason why we aren't\" narrative); the researchers found that the more egalitarian/feministic a society is, the greater the gender differences will be (regarding what people will choose to pursue). In other words, when you give women free choice to pursue whatever they want, they will willfully choose occupations/education/life goals that will only increase the gender gap between men and women.*\n2. The statistic does not account for **different positions within a respective field** (e.g. head/lead developer vs senior developer vs junior developer; they're all developers, but different rankings/positions). We know this because it's not possible to know the relative rankings/positions of people's careers if they don't even know what those careers are in the first place.\n   * [*Source 6.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1808858) *Looked at a company from the years 1966 and 1969-1971; found no gender discrimination when accounting for all variables. States that at most, there may be gender discrimination with regards to promotion, but even this is speculative as it is not explained why this may be the case (and truth be told, we already know why this is; I will explain later on). If the concept of a gender wage gap was already being debunked/disproved back then, it definitely doesn't exist now (at least, not in favor of men anyway...).*\n   * [*Source 7.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30038574) *Studies a company that was sued for ACTUALLY discriminating against women with regards to promotion, and found that there wasn't any pay differences between men and women who were given the same job/assignment. In other words, even when discriminating against women, they were still being fair about the pay.*\n3. The statistic does not account for **age** (e.g. a young person may make more money than an older person in a physically-taxing field, older people in fields that would require more knowledge/wisdom to handle, etc.).\n   * [*Source 8.*](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26623) *Generally speaking, workers over age 40 are only about half as likely to get a job offer as younger workers if employers know their age*\n4. The statistic does not account for **job tenure** (i.e. how long someone has been working for their respective employer for).\n   * [*Source 9.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122413514584) *Shows men in general have greater job tenure than women. It's decreasing overall (particularly for men) but there are various reasons for it, many of which are oftentimes advantageous from a career/monetary standpoint, which men are going to be more receptive towards since men typically prioritize money more than other aspects of a career (see Source 1).*\n   * [*Source 10.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831432) *It's in the title; job tenure typically entails higher wages. In recent times, this has been changing within certain fields (hence why it's been decreasing as shown in Source 8 above), but the point still stands overall.*\n5. **Men work more than women**, which implicates in the previous 2 points with men being able to develop greater job tenure and work experience. More men work full-time than women. Moreover, the term 'full-time\" means anyone working 35 hours or more (with some lowering it to 30 hours or more to further skew the stats in favor of their social agenda); this could mean anywhere from 35 hours to 135 hours per week, and I can tell you right now that the vast majority of people who are working an exorbitantly high number of hours are men, NOT women.\n   * [*Source 11.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2015/time-spent-working-by-full-and-part-time-status-gender-and-location-in-2014.htm) *Statistics from the US government. Men simply work more than women, even when comparing men who work full-time to women who work full-time, and men who work part-time to women who work part-time.*\n   * [*Source 12.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2019/pdf/home.pdf) *More statistics from the US government for 2019.*\n      * *\"Among full-time workers, those usually working at a job 35 hours or more per week, men are more likely than women to work more than 40 hours per week. In 2019, 25 percent of men who usually work full time worked 41 or more hours per week, compared with 14 percent of women. Women were more likely than men to work 35 to 39 hours per week: 10 percent of women worked such hours in 2019, while 4 percent of men did\" (p. 8).*\n      * *Women were more likely to be working a part-time job than men.*\n      * *\"Women who worked part time made up 23 percent of all female wage and salary workers in 2019. In comparison, 11 percent of men in wage and salary jobs worked part time.\"*\n   * [*Source 13.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2020/pdf/home.pdf) *Even more statistics from the US government for 2020.*\n      * *19.6% of men working full-time worked 41 or more hours per week, compared to only 10.2% of women who were working full-time. This means that men working full-time were nearly twice as likely as women to work 41 hours per work or more (Table 5). This coincides with* [data discussed at the 2019 G20 Summit](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---cabinet/documents/publication/wcms_713376.pdf)*.*\n      * *Men working full-time were also 2.3 times more likely than women to work 60+ hour weeks: 4.3% of men worked 60 hours per week or more compared to only 1.9% of women.*\n      * *Women working full-time were more than twice as likely as men to work shorter workweeks of 35 to 39 hours per week: 7.7% of full-time women worked those hours, compared to only 3.6% of men who did so.*\n      * *Men working 35-39 hours per week earned only 92.4% of what women earned working those same hours ($600 median weekly earnings for men vs. $649 for women). This means there was a 7.6% gender earnings gap in favor of female workers (for that cohort), and this is BEFORE accounting for any confounding variables!!!*\n      * *Women were more likely to be working a part-time job than men.*\n      * *Although not reported by the BLS, it can be estimated using its data that the average workweek for full-time workers (in 2020) was 41.3 hours for women and 42.8 hours for men, meaning the average man employed full-time worked 1.5 more hours per week compared to the average woman. This adds up to men, on average, having worked an additional 78 hours per year compared to the average full-time female worker.*\n      * *Some of the raw earnings gap naturally disappears by simply controlling for some of the variables. For example, women technically earned 82.3% of median male earnings for all workers working 35+ hours per week (i.e. full-time). But for those workers with a 40-hour workweek (more than three-quarters of all full-time female workers), women earned 87.4% of median male earnings, and that's after accounting for just one variable: hours worked.*\n      * *For young, full-time workers aged 16-24, women earned 94.7% of the median earnings of their male counterparts. Once again, controlling for just a single important variable—age—we find that more than two-thirds of the \"gender pay gap\" disappears. There are tons of other factors like these that go unaccounted for when you hear people/the media talk about the gender pay gap. Keep this in mind from now on.*\n   * [*Source 14.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2008/02/art5full.pdf) *Conducted by the US government. Looks at 12 European nations and shows that men work more than women in all of the countries studied, among many other things.*\n   * [*Source 15.*](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t04.htm) *Government statistics for 2021. Men clearly work more than women.*\n   * [*Source 16.*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00197939211045376) *Some people may not think that men work more than women enough to help warrant the pay gap, but this paper explains otherwise (they basically accounted for the jobs being worked and how men and women vary in the number of hours worked within these specific jobs rather than ignoring the types of jobs worked).*\n6. Building off the previous point, **men work more overtime**, and the gender pay gap statistic does not account for overtime pay. And if men are working more hours than women, that means that men are going to make more money from overtime which is higher than your standard base rate.\n   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *This is one of my favorite studies ever. It's just so well-done and is, in my opinion, the epitome of what research is supposed to look like. It was conducted by Harvard University, and one of the authors is literally a woman (meaning there isn't any bias caused by sexism or misogyny on behalf of the authors). It demonstrates a multitude of things, but as it relates to this specific point, it shows clearly that men work more overtime than women (p. 2–3; Figure A.16, p. 85).*\n7. **Men are more likely to accept overtime, and especially when presented without prior notice** (e.g. if someone had an emergency and couldn't come in, and employees are asked if they can stay, men are more likely to accept it). This means men tend to be more reliable workers overall. It's technically a separate point from the one above because the frequency of accepting overtime is different from actually working it (e.g. someone could work a lot of overtime one week and not work it at all for the next 12 weeks, vs someone who works only a few hours of overtime every week).\n   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *Also shows how men are more likely to accept overtime when it's presented to them and that men in general are especially more likely to accept overtime without prior notice (p. 3; Figure 6, p. 49; Figure A.17, p. 86).*\n8. **Men are less likely to have unexcused absences.**\n   * [*Source 17.*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bolotnyy/files/be_gendergap.pdf) *Women have more unexcused leave of absences than men (Figure 22, p. 65). This further implicates men as being more reliable workers. What's ironic is that men face harsher penalties/disciplinary measures than women (Figure 21, p. 64), contrary to popular belief.*\n9. The statistic does not account for **work experience** (i.e. how long someone has been working in their respective field).\n   * [*Source 18.*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2535309) *In general, men have greater work experience than women (courtesy of working more than women); the timing of work experience and overall work matters a lot as well, and since men are simply working more than women, the advantages of this timing will be more apparent in men than women. This study has data directly showing that men have greater actual work experience, potential work experience, and job tenure than women (the last of which relates back to the previous numbered point).*\n10. **Men do not get pregnant and are less likely to leave work for kids** (e.g. paternity leave); pregnancy forces women to stop working, which relates back to points 4, 5, 8, and 9, and men being less likely to leave work for kids also shows more dedication to work.\n      * [*Source 19.*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwao.12506) *The abstract alone states \"mothers with young children have reduced their work hours four to five times more than fathers\". Some of you may say that this therefore nullifies Source 12 as supporting evidence for point 5, but it actually strengthens it because it exemplifies the gender differences that can cause a skew in the gender wage gap myth and highlights the behavioral dimorphism between the sexes. At most, it would only nullify SOME of its generalizability on a year-to-year basis, but even then, it still showcases how statistics can be skewed/misrepresented to provide a false narrative about gender discrimination that doesn't actually exist with regards to pay. Anyway, Source 13 also states similar as well due to the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) where women are far more likely to leave work/not come in, but I don't want to be redundant and keep using the same source even though it's a fantastic study.*\n11. **Men are less likely to take sick days.**\n      * [*Source 20.*](https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/68/5/320/4973626) *Women take more sick leave than men, even after accounting for many variables.*\n      * [*Source 21.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6070205/) *The introduction alone is enough to show that women take more sick leave than men, this is undisputed and has been for decades. This study sought to determine whether there were differences in attitudes towards sick leave based on gender, and whether this contributes to women's absenteeism. They did not find much support for this, indicating that women take more sick leave regardless of societal norms and expectations.*\n      * [*Source 22.*](https://journals.lww.com/joem/Abstract/2015/08000/High_Job_Demands,_Job_Strain,_and_Iso_Strain_Are.5.aspx) *Women take more sick leave due to mental health reasons than men (p. 860), with 90% of \"mental health\" reasons being either stress, mood, and/or anxiety-related.*\n12. **Men are less likely to take vacation days.**\n      * [*Source 23.*](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1019.5400&rep=rep1&type=pdf) *Great study that shows how women take more vacation days than men, while also discussing why it is the case. Has several other findings/key points that showcase male-female dimorphism as it relates to work and the family, and they are very interesting; they essentially prove what is already self-evident with regards to gender roles, despite what mainstream society is trying to push today.*\n13. **Men are more likely to move for a job.**\n      * [*Source 24.*](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol40/53/40-53.pdf) *Shows conclusively that men are more willing to move for a job. They try to say that single women are just as likely as single men to move for a job after accounting for confounding variables, but that's nonsense because one of the variables was essentially how well they like the job (i.e. \"job characteristics\"), when the location of a job doesn't have an impact on how much the job itself should or should not be liked (and if any of you researchers disagree, you will need to account for the Halo Effect to fully make sure that distance isn't what's making them view those same \"job characteristics\" as distasteful enough for them to not want to move). It's as if they're trying to say that jobs should cater to women by changing how they operate so women will like them better, rather than simply just acknowledge that women do not want to move for work as much as men. In fact, it's not even as if they're saying that, they literally suggest it lmao! It's very gynocentric when you look at it. The reason why they say this is because they do not want to admit that the gender gap is literally caused by women's own personal preferences, because then that would mean that the gender gap is normal, natural, and that women willfully make the choices that cause the gender gap, essentially nullifying any narrative that women are victims of oppression and that the gender differences that exist between men and women are caused by men and women ACTUALLY being different. This last point really irks the ideologues. In addition, it would place accountability over the gender gap on women, and women absolutely cannot handle having accountability.*\n      * [*Source 25.*](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/app/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/GD_ResearchReport_MetroMovers_Draft4-1.pdf) *Literally the same thing as the previous source (including all of the progressive diatribes that I dismantled) but with a massive online job search website.*\n      * [*Source 26.*](https://web.stanford.edu/~niederle/CEN_discrimination.pdf) *This one has some progressivism within it as well, but ignoring that, we find that any discrimination against women isn't due to them on the sole basis of them being women, but rather because of beliefs over how well they would do the job. In fact, it shows that people are MORE likely to favor women as job candidates when a negative belief is ascribed to a woman rather than when it is ascribed without the gender being stated. In other words, gender discrimination isn't gender discrimination at all but rather performance discrimination, which is the definition of a meritocracy (i.e. a system in which people are judged based on their merit/how good they are at their job, rather than characteristics unrelated to said job/merit).*\n14. **Men are more likely to work night shifts.**\n      * [*Source 26.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2021/article/nonstandard-work-schedules-in-29-european-countries-2005-15-differences-by-education-gender-and-parental-status.htm) *Government study looking at data across 29 European nations from 2005-2015. It shows that in every region, save for Scandinavia, men are more likely than women to work hours outside the standard 9-5. This coincides with data from Source 14 and Source 17, which showed similar findings.*\n      * [*Source 27.*](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3216/3084) *Shows definitively that men are more likely to work night shifts than women.*\n15. **Men are more likely to work weekends.**\n      * [*Source 27.*](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3216/3084) *Also shows that men are more likely to work weekends than women.*\n      * [*Source 28.*](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2011/07/art1full.pdf) *While also showing that men are more likely to work nonstandard work shifts, it also shows that men are more likely to work weekends as well, which Source 11, Source 14, Source 15, and Source 17 also demonstrated.*\n16. **Men are more likely to work holidays.**\n      * *Yet again, this was already shown by Source 11, Source 14, and Source 15.*\n17. **Men are far more likely to work dangerous jobs** such as oil riggers, underwater welders, etc. These male-dominated jobs pay higher than nurses and hair stylists on the basis of danger, hence why it's separate from the first point.\n      * [*Source 29.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4880472/) *Men are more likely to work dangerous jobs and are simply more willing to accept risks that jobs may have in general. This is represented by the fact that men make up most workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 30.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfoi2004_chart11.pdf) *US government data for 2004; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (93%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 31.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfoi2006_14.pdf) *US government data for 2006; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (92%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 32.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/osh/os/oshs2008_33.pdf) *US government data for 2008; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (93%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 33.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfch0009.pdf) *US government data for 2010; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (92%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 34.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfch0011.pdf) *US government data for 2012; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (92%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 35.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cftb0292.pdf) *US government data from 2014; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (92%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 36.*](https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfoi-chart-data-2017.htm) *US government data from 2017; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (93%) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 37.*](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cfoi.pdf) *US government data from 2016-2020; shows that men make up the overwhelming majority (93%, 93%, 92%, 92%, 92% for each consecutive year, respectively) of workplace deaths.*\n         * [*Source 38.*](https://www.ualberta.ca/anesthesiology-pain-medicine/media-library/eliassons-wellness-docs/mens-mental-health/a-roadmap-to-mens-health.pdf) *97% of workplace deaths in Canada between 1993 and 2005 were men.*\n         * [*Source 39.*](https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-11/Work-related%20traumatic%20injury%20fatalities%20Australia%202019.pdf) *97% of workplace deaths in Australia were men in 2019, with similar trends from 2003-2018 as well. These are the things feminists will never, ever talk about.*\n18. **Men are more interested in jobs that are scalable**; men are more interested in physical things, while women are more interested in jobs that deal with people. The former is scalable, the latter is not; that means Elon Musk is able to service millions of people with Tesla whereas Mrs. Johnson is only able to teach a class of 30 students per year. This point is separate from the first point because scalability relates to potential growth/earning, and based on the laws of chance, you're more likely to find some major hit successes in professions that are scalable rather than unscalable.\n      * [*Source 40.*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19883140/) *Meta-analysis showing men are interested in things, and that women are interested in people.*\n      * [*Source 41.*](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00189/full) *Another meta-analysis that supports the previous one above; \"patterns of gender differences in interests and the actual gender composition in STEM fields were explained by the people-orientation and things-orientation of work environments\". Basically, even in male-dominated fields, women are overrepresented in service-based and people-oriented STEM fields such as the health sciences, with the trend being found on a multinational level. This also acts as evidence for the very first point about men choosing higher-paying jobs.*\n         * [*Source 42.*](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_aa2018.htm) *Evidence from the US showing this trend with women.*\n         * [*Source 43.*](https://afmc.ca/sites/default/files/pdf/CMES/CMES2018-Complete_EN.pdf) *Evidence from Canada showing this trend with women.*\n         * [*Source 44.*](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/health-at-a-glance-2017/doctors-by-age-sex-and-category_health_glance-2017-53-en) *Evidence from OECD countries (38 in total, with another 10 non-OECD countries included throughout in some data).*\n19. **Men are more likely to ask for a raise.**\n      * [*Source 45.*](https://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/16689) *Men are more likely to ask for a raise; the only exception is when women enter managerial positions (i.e. are put in male roles, basically). It also shows that women are basically worse at negotiating than men (\"less successful\" = euphemism for being worse at).*\n      * [*Source 46.*](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1994) *Women are only as likely as men to ask for a raise when they are explicitly told they can negotiate for one. I can tell you right now that most jobs rarely ever directly tell its employees that they can freely ask for a raise lol.*\n      * [*Source 47.*](https://escholarship.org/content/qt9978v172/qt9978v172.pdf?t=omys3w) *Women are less comfortable engaging in salary negotiations, they're less likely to negotiate salaries overall, and they're not as good at it as men (the researchers don't word this last point this way because it angers feminists, but that's the gist of it). There are many other reasons that they go into as well.*\n20. **Men are typically more aggressive/competitive in their mindset and attitudes regarding work** which helps them climb the corporate ladder more (e.g. you make more off commission in sales because you close more sales due to being more competitive).\n      * [*Source 48.*](https://archive.bio.org/sites/default/files/docs/toolkit/Why%20Men%20Still%20Get%20More%20Promotions%20than%20Women_HBR%20article.pdf) *Upon reading this, you find that women are essentially not as willing to do what it takes to climb the corporate ladder; the report says that therefore the entire civilizational structure should change to favor women, but that's just ridiculous. Why not just admit that women are not as willing to hyperfocus on their careers in the same way as men? Why not just admit that women don't do it because they simply don't want to sacrifice other areas of their life for a career? Why not just finally admit that women are different from men? They can't. And that's a problem for BOTH genders.*\n21. **The top people are always going to be men due to the variability hypothesis.**\n      * [*Source 49.*](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/493921) *Men vary greater than women; when seeing any of the extremes, men are more likely to be represented on both ends. That means the most successful people in the world are going to overwhelmingly be men, and the most unsuccessful dregs of society will also be men. This represents a problem with feminist thinking because they want \"equality\" when it comes to powerful, important, and successful positions in society and say that a lack thereof in these top positions are due to sexism and discrimination (and that therefore all of men and society need to just give women these positions to \"make it fair\"), but they will never talk about the men at the lowest ends of society or talk about equalizing that. I'm not saying they should become homeless criminals and whatnot either (rather they should focus on decreasing the amount of men that are disenfranchised here; but they'll never do that since they would have to admit that men aren't oppressors and would have to actually acknowledge the plights of men), I'm just saying there's a double standard here whereby women want the rights and privileges of both sexes with the responsibilities of neither, all the while blaming men for any (and all) of their own shortcomings and faults.*\n      * [*Source 50.*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886913003036) *Men vary more than women yet also tend to be better on average on measures of creativity.*\n      * [*Source 51.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variability_hypothesis#:~:text=The%20variability%20hypothesis%2C%20also%20known,most%20traits%20than%20females%20do.) *For those who still don't get it, here's a Wikipedia article since they tend to describe things fairly simply and succinctly.*\n\nJust to really drive home the point, I quote the official statement of the US Department of Labor after having a massive [study](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2019/pdf/home.pdf) conducted for them:\n\n>**This study leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a multitude of factors and that the raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action. Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers.**\n\nAnd even ignoring the technical research aspects, just think about it like this: If a woman were to do the same job as a man for less pay, only women would get hired because that would be CHEAP LABOR. And for those who don't know, there's a whole sexism argument that claims men get hired more easily than men (which also isn't necessarily true either, but that's a separate discussion).\n\nThere isn't a single statistician who isn't braindead, let alone competent, who takes the statistics presented about the gender pay gap myth at face value when drawing conclusions. It's only after you account for all the variables available can you really begin to extrapolate true causality, and even then it is still weak with these types of statistical analyses anyway since it's virtually impossible to account for every variable that exists *and* have a full consensus for data rather than a statistic that has a much smaller sample size. Plus, when it comes to statistical analyses like this, you're ultimately seeing how things relate to one another (i.e. correlated) rather than seeing how they directly influence/cause something. The only way to truly test for causality is by running actual experiments with strong controls in place (which is nigh on impossible to do in situations like these). If you take a statistics class or two, you'll learn about this stuff more in-depth. Multivariate analyses are pretty much always better than univariate ones (when drawing final conclusions from, anyway), and it's due to reasons like this where society perpetuates the gender pay gap myth as a social dogma.\n\nIf women can do anything men can do (and \"do it better\"), then why are they still supposedly \"oppressed\"? Why are they still the victims? And why do they need government legislation to mandate \"gender equality\" in order to achieve it? If they were really the same as men (i.e. \"equal\") in all these regards, wouldn't perfect equality naturally occur based on merit alone? It doesn't make sense, and it's simply because it's just not true. Men and women aren't the same, and we won't ever be the same. That doesn't mean we shouldn't be treated fairly—equity over equality, always—but this myth needs to die once and for all.\n\n﷽\n\nوَلَا تَتَمَنَّوْا۟ مَا فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ بِهِۦ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ ۚ لِّلرِّجَالِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا ٱكْتَسَبُوا۟ ۖ وَلِلنِّسَآءِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا ٱكْتَسَبْنَ ۚ وَسْـَٔلُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مِن فَضْلِهِۦٓ ۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمًا",

    "text": "I am so so very tired from the overtime I need to work because of women in the teams I work with who aren't functioning. I'm working until midnight day after day and into the weekend week after week. It's all a lie. Almost no woman I work with who has a demanding position actually works. I do it all Such women have the degree (I have it too) or a title in the email signature three-four words long.  Equal, no? Well no. Most of the time, almost always, she won't have a clue on how to do the work her job requires. They will spread confident statements that will sound knowledgeable but if you actually know what they are talking about you will know it's complete nonsense - mistakes and fabrications - they are simply making it up (instead of simply looking it up). It becomes obvious to you after a while that they see their competence not as being skillful, experienced and as a result very effective - but as being good at throwing around the right \"buzz sentences\" to make it look as if they are someone you can trust with that job. They will send you their \"completed task\" and it will almost always be half baked. You will need to do your share - and 50% or more of theirs, you will need to spend more time on fixing problems they created (by never asking how something is done and instead \"throwing something\"), and then you will find out that while they know you are leaning over your computer at 10 pm working to fix it, they are out of office.\n\nThese \"a woman can do anything a man can\" women, holding \"same position as a man\", simply create a facade, a theater show. Mostly the only thing equal to a man they have is the job title and degree - they don't actually have the knowledge, know how to do the job or put in the effort needed, rather, the \"equal number of women\" in such positions is made possible by men doing their own 100% and then 50% of the women's work.\n\nThis is the reality of it all. Not all women in these positions are like that - absolutely not! I worked with bright, hard-working, responsible, knowledgeable women (\"knowledgeable\" means: being responsible enough to spend time looking for all the needed knowledge and making sure you really understand it, instead of relying on mumbling something and on someone else \"taking care of it\"), who will hold their end of the pole with you and won't let go until it's in place, but they were a rare sight. In nine out of ten cases, it would be sleepless nights, no weekends, to do the woman's part and then some (as for men, my experience was that they do their best - each according to his capacity. If they're not holding their end it's because their mother is in hospital, not because they don't want to \\[edit: come to think of it, a slouchy man in these responsible roles just gets replaced as soon as everyone have time to breath again. Maybe knowing this pushes men to deliver while women might get the opposite message - we need you for the body count so as long as you don't shoot a missile at the office you won't get replaced\\]. And if men don't know something they just say it and ask, instead of inventing nonsense that create problems that you need to then solve. Them not minding their \"ego\" and simply asking for instructions saves unimaginable amounts of time). Has anyone else had this experience? Any doctors or engineers here who can tell how it works in their field? (I'm so tired).",

    "text": "Do Not Quit It started with a commercial. Many years ago, I was a kid watching TV when an ad came on about the state of education in our country. It featured a young girl putting a dunce s cap on a young boy. The tagine was \"the future looks bleak for boys in eduction\". Oh yeah? I thought. We ll just see about that.\n\nFor the next few years I applied myself with a vengeance in class, absorbing every bit of knowledge I could and learning every nuance of every subject: from history to mathematics, science to technology. (Of course I was hopeless on the sports fields but that s where my fellow young men applied themselves the most.) In most cases I was near the top of my class. But so too, were the girls.\n\nFrom French to History class, the highest achievers were nearly always female - i was the only male in my French college class for example. What the advert had said was true. On the sports field the boys continued to reign supreme (at least at our school). But in every other subject, the girls were outpacing the boys. \n\nUndeterred I studied hard and got to university, where again, at least half the students were female. And again they excelled with high grades, many going on to land prestigious jobs on graduation. My generation of graduates had a strong female contingent, and within a few years, these women were visible in most major corporate, civil service or entertainment roles. Now I hear that women are the majority of students in higher education. \n\nBut what disturbs me is the alarming number of young men who are dropping out. If this were the sports field, the streets, or even the battlefield, any man knocked down would get straight back up (it s in our nature after all.) So why is it that so many men are quitting education? \n\nI get that it s a frustrating system, sometimes engineered by misandrists who clearly want to drive us mad (one overtly feminist lecturer at my old faculty comes to mind.) But you must not quit. If we just gave up in a sports game, the other side would win. And I tell you now: the same applies to education. \n\nIf you drop out, you give up your place to someone else. They will most likely use that to gain a good position of power at your expense - trust me, I've met the ones who have. And they know how to make life hard for  you.\n\nKnowledge is power and the mind is a muscle. If this were the gym, you d be honing that 'muscle' every day. (After all this is what martial arts masters have been doing for centuries.)\n\nWe need to treat education as a vital resource: something that gives us a competitive edge over others. \n\nAnd that s why I say to all men and boys in eduction: \n\nDo. Not. Quit. \n\nOnly by staying at the table can you have your say on the way things are. I m keen to hear your experiences of education and why you think so many men are quitting.",

    "text": "Red Pill saved me from being a \"captain save h**\" I'm not even sure if this post belongs here or not but I couldn't find anywhere else to write this. I have been a MRA for a little over a year now, and I read this subreddit all the time and want to first say thank you for a lot of the insights you guys share. And for the record I do NOT believe that MRA and Red Pill are exactly in the same category. But I would like to share how streamers in the Red Pill/Manosphere community like Kevin Samuels, Think before you sleep, and even AT, have helped me realize how much self worth you should have as a man, what we deserve, what it takes to achieve it, how to know if a women is a asset to you or a liability, to stop putting women on these pedestals, whether they're western or from overseas!  \n\n\nThis dive into the more red pill communities came when I would be thinking about my (29M) relationship, while I was in it with this woman (25F). Now I had known this woman since highschool, and man she was fine af. Now I wasn't no lame(prepare for humble brag), in fact quite the opposite, I was the star athlete in highschool, top 3 recruit in my state(US), 15th ranked recruit nationwide, and I was great looking, and for a lack of better words, I had hoes. But there was this one girl that I couldn't get and man she was fine. For whatever reason she would mess with almost all my other friends/teammates but me. Now this didn't really upset me(she was a freshy and I was a senior) but there was always this \"I'm gonna get her someday\" attitude that always stayed with me. Anyways after highschool I went and had a pretty successful career in my sport, becoming a 3 year starter, winning many championships in college eventually graduating, playing pro, and a few years ago I retired.   \n\n\nNow it took me about 2 years to really get back on my feet after retiring, since I hadn't really developed any skills outside of my sport, and I didn't want to be a coach. Since I have always loved video games, I ended up getting into programing which I cant be thankful enough for since it really opened up some doors. I busted my ass and swallowed my pride by working as a maintenance tech while I taught myself to program for 2 years, and sure enough towards the end of last year I was able to land a position as a Mid level software engineer. Now all this time me and that chick have been following each other on IG, and while she was partying, doing onlyfans, and getting passed around, I was grinding, but for some reason I still wanted her. Last year, I reached out to her and she's surprised and flattered and blah blah, so eventually we go on a date, and lo and behold, she has a kid she's been hiding... Now normally thats a dealbreaker for me but since this was my dream girl back in the day and coming from a single parent home myself, I had a soft spot for her, I brushed it off like it wasn't a big deal.... I know I was simping hard lol. I learned a lot about her when we were dating, somethings I wish I hadn't lol. Just to name a few, she was basically a major thot her whole life, also she was struggling real bad jobless, her and her kid living with her parents, barely surviving off of the onlyfans/stripper money she made(she stopped for the kid, plus aging). The BD wanted nothing to do with her, hell he moved out the country. Even her own family barely liked her and etc. All in all she had some MAJOR baggage/issues, but it again that didn't matter too me. I was being a captain save a h\\*\\*. She convinced me that she found god and that she changed and became celibate, and finished her degree and blah blah, and I believed it. I know, how stupid.   \n\n\nNow the relationship was going smooth, I mean she had some great qualities, and things seemed to be going at a good pace, not bringing me around the kid etc, until one day about 3.5 months in she really started pressing me, like hard. Saying how much loves me and respects me, how she wants me to be stepdad and get married, blah blah, I mean love bombing the shit outta me, and my dumbass was eating it up, because in MY MIND she's still that girl from highschool that got away. So now she's more demanding, but I've always been pretty good about setting boundaries and being patient so nothing ever went outta my comfort zone. But of course like most of us have been through, I ended up paying for every date, always picking her up, buying her things, giving her emotional support, helping her with jobs/finances, which I don't mind doing for my girlfriends, as long as there's some reciprocation besides sex...  \n\n\nNow what setup my path down the red pill rabbit hole was when I was looking for a new place, she never insisted on living together and I told her it was too soon (only 3 months in at this point) but I realized that eventually she will try to strong arm herself and her kid into my home, because she had been lowkey doing that already. I had been looking for a new but bigger one bedroom initially, but then when I would think about her, and I would start looking for two bedrooms, even houses. At the time I didn't even realize why I was doing that, and I was also looking for advice on being a stepdad, even though deep deep down I didn't want to be. That lead to me seeing these redpill videos talking about why men shouldn't date single moms, red flags to look for in women, etc.. I was curious so I watched them, then it all hit me. I was being so blinded by the fact I got my dream girl from highschool that I didn't see all the other MAJOR OBVIOUS RED FLAGS that even a blind man can see. Mainly how she wasnt that girl anymore, how manipulative she was, the wishy washy attitudes/temper tantrums, not taking accountability, the VERY disturbing sexual past, the not so subtle \"I hate all men but not you\" attitude, the kid who was 2 already, I mean the list goes on and on. Soon I found myself thinking, WTF am I doing? How does this relationship benefit me besides sex whenever I want? Sure she's great... sometimes, and makes me happy... sometimes, but like I'm way better than this. Sure she's still hot but not as hot as she was when she didn't want me, she didn't want me when she was childless, she didn't want me before she was used up, I mean for gods sake she didn't want me when I was pro athlete, her decision making is terrible lol. So what am I doing? Why am I even considering taking on all her burden and past mistakes when I've worked so hard to put myself where I'm at? It's because I didn't have a healthy sense of myself, I didn't see how valuable I was, my whole identity was sports and when I lost that, I didn't know who I was and I had to figure out who I was all over again, all alone. And idk if this sounds bad or not and I really dgaf but, the manosphere helped me realize this. Those men along with a few others in person really helped me realize, how stupid I was being, how much better I deserved and how much better off I am to stay away from women like that, cause even a guy like me who seemed to have it all can fall flat on his face and fall for the okie doke.   \n\n\nNow there's no excuse, I ignored all those red flags, I chose to be with her, and I own up to it. And I can respect someone wanting to change, but in her case it was too late, and I realized I or any other man should have to fix her messes. I also took responsibility and dumped her ass, not in a mean way of course, and she still did not take it well lol. Now all I can do is continue to move forward, and learn from that experience, and to keep putting in the work no matter how small everyday to better myself. I know this got really long and is off topic about what normally goes on in here, but I just wanted to share, I know some men out there went through something similar. And if you are currently, for god sakes stop.  \n\n\nTLDR, How the redpill/manosphere online communities helped in convincing me to dump a downbad thotiana.",
