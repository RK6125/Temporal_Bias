There is no special occasion for this cake except to say how thankful and glad we are that our little \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ has you as her teacher!\" They went on and explained how they were very impressed by what their child was explaining to them last night about dwarf planets Pluto and Makemake and how the sun was formed and the dos/don'ts/reason for Chinese New Year so they felt inspired to reach out to say thank you. I was so touched after reading the letter that the secretaries and I were almost in tears! They told the principal about it and had me bring it down to show her after school, which made me feel really good. I'm only a second year teacher so this is the first big thank you out of nowhere I've gotten and it just made my day! They even remembered to get me a gluten free cake (I have celiac and mentioned I need gf on my PTA favorites list, but never actually told anyone)! I love hearing that my first graders are actually retaining some of our many conversations and so excited about it that they share it with their families. It meant so much to me I had to share. :)",

    "text": "I Catered Lunch for My Building Administrative Staff Ever since Superintendent Jara (Clark County School District, Nevada) announced the layoffs of all 170 deans and 25 assistant principals, I think a lot of teachers and support staff in the district (myself included) have felt as though we've been on a wild roller coast ride.\n\nToday I learned that in an effort to preserve our dean's job, our building principal with a majority support of the teachers and staff, has opted to create a new AP slot. Even though the (displaced) dean understands that this is a metaphorical long shot since union contracts means that this job has to first be offered to the 25 displaced assistant principals, this would be the only way she could stay at our school since there are no teaching vacancies that she's qualified for.\n\nWhat's really annoying is that after gutting the ability of all secondary schools in the district to manage school safety and to enforce order and good discipline, the HR department won't let my principal post the newly created AP vacancy until July 26th. They've cited \"contract requirements.\" The principal is now trying to get an exception from the superintendent.\n\nIf the job isn't posted until July 26th, there will only be 2 1/2 weeks left until the start of the 2019-2020 school year. This won't give any of the displaced APs much time to apply for the job which I suppose would only benefit our dean. The flip side is that if one of the displaced APs were to take the job, our dean would have a very narrow window to find an alternate teaching job in the greater Vegas area. Since we're at a rural school, she would also not have time to move. Assuming she found a job, she would have to commute a two hour round trip drive.\n\nSince there's nothing I can do regarding our district's budget deficit, as the chef instructor of my school's Culinary Arts program, I made arrangements with the principal to cater a Chinese lunch for the administrative team.  Pictured below, clockwise from top left: orange chicken, stir fried collard greens with broccoli, beef and vegetable egg rolls, Hakka style braised pork.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/etw5gz852u531.jpg?width=1065&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8980b982e2de6a48b00bab3abac1771f2a50e87\n\nNot pictured: Sweet red chili sauce for the egg rolls, one shrimp and pork egg roll that I made for the school secretary since she can't eat cabbage, stir fried shrimp with a Cantonese lobster sauce, and an additional vegetable dish (roasted Brussels sprouts with baby corn and cauliflower) that I made for the dean since she's vegetarian.\n\nAlthough I had offered to make some additional meatless vegan dishes for the dean, she told me that she would be happy with rice and vegetables.\n\nAdmin seemed happy with the meal and hopefully this helped make for a nice ending to their work week.\n\nAlthough the CCEA has reaffirmed its intention to strike after the new school year resumes, I haven't heard when this strike will be or where we'll be picketing. I have ordered a Red for Ed Nevada shirt through Amazon.\n\nThe strike will be too late for our deans and APs. Their last payday will be at the end of July. Our school year doesn't resume until August.\n\nCCSD is currently the 5th largest public school district in the country. We have  300,000 students, 35,000 employees, 336 schools and an annual budget of $5.2 billion. An estimated 60% of all teachers belong to the CCEA, so any strike will cripple the district and will most likely force school closures.",

    "text": "Well I'm at my mental wall I've posted before that I work for an international school in Beijing. \nLuckily we've got a 12 day holiday coming up because I just hit the wall faster a ketamin'ed eagle. \nIn one week we got dropped with a multiple level bombshell of crap that has to be done before next Sunday:\n\nStudents must be ready for a spelling Bee this week \n\nStudents must have fully rehearsed all their upcoming winter show practices for the Sunday performance (some children are doing more than 10)\n\nFinal exams are one day after the holiday, so students must be fully prepared and reviewed ahead of time with winter holidays homework. \n\nSpeech contests are on going and foreign homeroom teachers must assist the kids with that. \n\nClassrooms must be fully decorated for Xmas. \n\nPrepare end of semester student reports and self assessment worksheets. \n\n\nThis sound like a lot for 10 days of work? It gets better. Every time we try to review for the final exam we get informed by Chinese leaders that it's time for another rehearsal instead. \n\nI enjoy the job despite the commute, but this past week or so has actually broken me and the teachers, including the foreign principal.",

This was basically a promotion thought it added a lot of responsibility. She also switched from a 10 month contract to an 11 month contract.\n\nLast week our principal broke the news that our former colleague had suffered a stroke. Although she recovered quickly, she's partially paralyzed and is out on an extended sick leave partially to have time to recover but also because she'll need time to work with a physical therapist. The good news is that her long term memory has not been affected and she has retained some mobility. She can also speak. \n\nA call went out for teachers at the elementary school and our junior-senior high school to cater meals for her family. I was sorry to hear that she was the sole supporter for a family of four. \n\nI volunteered to bring food in tomorrow for delivery by another colleague on Saturday. I prepared two plastic to-go containers of orange-mango chicken (pictured above) and two additional containers of beef with broccoli (pictured below). I also used a rice cooker to prepare 5 cups of steamed white rice .\n\nI THOUGHT about making a 5th container of Buddha's Delight which is Chinese vegan dish but decided that I might be going overboard. \n\nI hope this person will recover and be able to return to work. I will have to check and see if anyone has started a Go Fund Me campaign on her behalf to offset expenses. \n\nThe staff turnout for providing meals was really impressive. Within an hour of word getting out, every slot for the next two weeks was filled. I've heard that there's even a waiting list for the following two weeks should this catering service be extended. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mq9tfske0ic21.jpg?width=5312&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6cf3f4406ddc41c1173c7541018a9e3df68f16e6",
