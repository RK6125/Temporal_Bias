    "text": "Am I just entitled or is every job seriously exhausting with its own set of pitfalls? Or both\n\nMaybe I’m expecting too much. \n\nI’ve tried a few pathways now and here were my experiences;\n\n- Marketing —> having to spin 20 plates simultaneously yet people only seem to notice when one falls, distinctly superficial atmosphere, constantly vying for work and perhaps even for basic respect, quite often having to explain the need for your job to even exist, much of it is now understandably outsourced, the pathetic  jargon one has to endure and the pseudo-intellectual attempt to scientize what is in most cases just common sense (I recall trying to stifle my laughter as some schmuck enlightening me about how setting high prices will result in less demand as though it were quantum mechanics), having to engage with social media (especially the rancid realm of LinkedIn) as part of your job  \n\nFreelance Web design —> Welcomed degree of autonomy and ability to work from home, projects were varied and oftentimes quite interesting, some creative latitude, however… workload is sporadic, work is being increasingly undercut and outsourced, a constant battle to secure clients, and clients are frequently maddening by changing or scrapping or ignoring your ideas as if they know best (yes it’s their website and their vision but there are researched frameworks that should be adhered to), most clients wouldn’t pay on time and some refused to pay at all, most of all the solitude gets to you after a while and the blessing of working alone eventually becomes something more akin to a curse \n\n- Retail —> reminds you how much you despise your fellow man and makes one consider banishing oneself to live as a misanthropic hermit in a fucking cave somewhere far away from the drooling masses with their screaming pterodactyl children, having to contend with equally braindead managers who genuinely seem to believe in the dumb philosophy that the customer is always right (they almost never  are), feeling like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day and begin having similarly morbid thoughts, however every say 1 in 1000 interactions are…dare I say mildly pleasant, and at least you can’t take the work home with you  (though it may haunt your dreams)\n\nHospitality —> More loathsome then retail ( contrary to popular opinion), essentially retail but in a cramped space going at a frantic pace with more pedantic and entitled customers, psychotic chefs, sociopathic managers, bar tenders think they’re expert magicians, feels meaningless, overstimulation, steals your evenings and weekends (depending on the job), hated it \n\n- Physiotherapy —> Far more tedious and repetitious than I thought it to be, having to palpate a senior citizens crotch leads to existential crisis, long hours, pays quite poorly, have to compete with modern witch doctors known as chiropractic who many people seem to place more faith in for some godforsaken reason, puts a strain on ones own body from repetitive movement, clients are virtually never the demographic one would - how to say - prefer to be up close and personal with \n\nEnglish language teaching to international students —> Can feel greatly rewarding (learning language is of course life changing) and one intermingles with some very interesting characters, however the pay is abysmal, the work is unstable and much of it is taken home (lesson preparation and marking), can be somewhat of a dead end - or at least progression requires a leap into a management role which changes the nature of the work completely, another global pandemic may come along and decimate the field again\n\nCrisis and Social work —> Rewarding as one is helping many people to survive the darkest days of their lives, however very tedious, emotionally draining, vicariously traumatising, dispiriting, potentially dangerous, criminally underpaid considering the responsibility, can be infuriating - one  may sit eye to eye with a mandated client who has raped his child without remorse and treat him with positive regard and professionalism, or a pregnant mother of 5 who tells you she’ll quit but continues abusing heroin, a kid who spits and refuses to talk to you, visits to the squalid  home of a psychotic man and his aggressive hounds - one has to posses an unbreakable constitution and a burning desire to help people and I don’t think I care enough about the well-being of strangers to justify the toll quite frankly\n\nPsychology —> What I’m currently pursuing; however I’ve always been fascinated by the mind and can see myself in the field of research with the ultimate goal being to publish some work and contribute to the advancement surrounding ADHD/neurological disorders … however it’s over saturated and insanely competitive, non-linear, research integrity has been distorted by capitalism, and it’s a long road ahead \n\nWriting —> Musing on the idea of pursuing a career focused on writing as it’s always been an area of passion for me, unsure of what direction to take it - my friend is far superior and could not manage to get his book published, it’s a far more cutthroat world than expected - journalism trammels what you can write about and dictates how you must write it, and you’re expected to churn out work like it’s going out of print, however the main reason i haven’t pursued it is for the same reason I never pursued music:  fear of associating what was once a therapeutic and magical pastime with mundane work and disenchanting the whole thing",

    "text": "Leaving a toxic job was the wake up call I needed to fulfill my dreams and reconnect with what is important. \nI started a job last September after being offered a competitive position at a boutique accounting firm in Victoria BC. The role consisted of operating as the Office Manager/Executive Assistant. \n\nI had an administrative background but little awareness of how intense an accounting firm could be or what this job truly would entail. I decided it was a great way to learn the ropes in a competitive industry with opportunity to make great wealth should I choose to pursue this path. \n\nI started the job with very little training and no educational base from a business administrative standpoint but my new bosses liked me and my confidence and had no qualms throwing me directly into the fire. The staff that would be training me were ESL and introverted, having no way to comprehend the best approach to teaching. \n\nDespite having to learn much of the role myself, I managed to keep on track and fulfill my duties. It was stressful but I assumed this would settle as I learned my duties. Alas, this would not be the case as I would soon see. \n\nShortly after being hired on,the stalky \n, unattractive and obnoxious office bully set her jealous eyes on me when I started gaining compliments and recognition for my extroversion, attractiveness and charisma in the office that transcended her own. She soon made it her mission to make my life hell. \n\nThis woman would ridicule and bully me to everyone in the office. When I was learning the role, if I did not know something, she would publicly announce how stupid I was and broadcast every error I made including to one of my bosses whom favoured her. \n\nI tried managing the situation by having private conversations with her about how I felt about her attitude and behaviour but she would go right back to her ways shortly after. \n\nDespite my rage I kept it together, until she decided to continuously bully and degrade my sweet natured coworker whom was too shy to stand up for herself. \n\nAlong with another coworker, we recorded and brought her despicable behaviour to my managers attention. They tried to rectify the situation but the boss that loved her told us that she had done nothing wrong and that we needed to grow a backbone. \n\nAfter another coworker reported her, the boss had no way to dodge the complaints and instead decided to yell at me for starting the whole thing to which I was calm and unmoved in his presence. From that day on he had an axe to grind with me. \n\nEach day I went to the office it got busier and I was left to do the bulk of the admin work in an office that required several admins to fulfill the position. As I proved myself capable and intelligent, I was handed piles of more work with no raise in wage as I was promised upon hiring and no benefits. \n\nI was the first to arrive an hour early and worked through lunch at my desk to get all my tasks done. This was commonplace in the office and an unspoken expectation. \n\nOn top of the ridiculous workload, I had to maintain the complex schedule of my other boss who requested all sorts of wild tasks ranging from private detective work, translations,  beginners bookkeeping and once I was even asked to participate in espionage against a clients enemy( I declined). \n\nI went home crying/cried in the bathroom\nat the office from being yelled at or bullied frequently and my health was starting to decline. In addition to this, my relationship with my partner was suffering as I was so stressed all the time and it led me to be exhausted and irritable with no reprieve for us at home.\n\nIt was after three or four months that I started to notice my health was slipping, I gained weight and was fatigued all the time. My wrists started to ache and pain from typing for 9hrs every day. I was losing my hair. I made an appointment with a doctor after the wrist pain wouldn’t go away and was diagnosed with carpal tunnel. \n\nI told my boss and manager about the injury but there was not much to be done and not much offered. We were approaching tax season and in spite of my extreme desire to quit and move jobs, I would feel terrible leaving when they required my help the most so I toughed it out. I purchased wrist splints for work and went to physical therapy , I got TPI injections and desperately tried to manage my pain but the carpal tunnel only got more aggressive and painful. I had to wear tiger balm and use pain killers all day and I was spending more than I could afford on therapy, taking money from my education fund to support myself. I was absent or working from home to ice my wrists and manage my pain whenever possible.\n\nMy doctor saw that my muscle tissue in my hands was wasting and saw how exhausted and stressed I was and told me to go on medical leave. I finally bit the bullet and handed in my leave. My two managers and one nice boss were supportive but the boss whom had a chip on his shoulder decided this was his opportunity to get back at me for standing up to his pet. \n\nHe dismissed me without notice two weeks before I had told them I would be leaving (illegal to do without severance) and decided to claim I owed the company $400 of time due to the fact it was not recorded in the system . I had not been trained to enter time in the system as I was on salary and the other girls were hourly and forgot to do so . I had kept track of my hours on an excel spreadsheet but he fought me on the validity of this. Him and the office bully were responsible for my final wages and my ROE (to my dismay) and I had to fight for both of these to be delivered to me two weeks late. I went without pay for this time and had no way to seek medical benefits without this. He was holding my ROE hostage until I agreed to the pay cut. \n\nHe was always arrogant and mean natured but this was shocking. I had always been the first one in the office and everyone had witnessed how long and hard I worked. To claim I hadn’t been present during this time was absolutely offensive and malicious.\n\nI would also like to note that this man was a multimillionaire and trying to nickel and dime someone whom was injured from the job and trying to support her healing on a very low salary. \n\nThere was no compassion and I had to get legal advice, support from the Employment Standards Act and Service Canada to get the bare minimum from these people. Two weeks of absolute hell and minimum contact from my employers.I had pleaded my more empathetic boss for his help but he made promise after promise to take care of it but did not until I threatened to report them. \n\nI was an absolute wreck and my health was in tatters, I was getting fevers and chills, passing out and shaking for two weeks. I was diagnosed with Addison’s Disease shortly after ( your body cannot produce cortisol after prolonged exposure to stress ) to which I am still recovering. \n\nI am so thankful to my partner for being so supportive and to my manager who went to bat for me and kept me in the loop with what was going on. She also helped me with my WorkSafe BC claim which was approved.\n\nIt’s now two months later and though I am still recovering I have began to get my health back. I unfortunately have to get surgery on my hand for my carpal tunnel but I have dropped the weight and I am helping my hormones get back to normal.\n\nI just enrolled in art school for the fall after my surgery. This whole experience made me see that life is too precious to be miserable in a job you hate that undervalues you . My health and happiness are more valuable than anything. \n\nI don’t want to end up unwell and unhappy like most of my peers were in that office and I will never make the mistake of sacrificing for a boss that wouldn’t do the same for me.\n\nI hope to one day become an art therapist and help others heal from the traumas they have experienced that hold them back from their own happiness. \n\nI hope my story can help others that are stuck in toxic jobs - leave before your body makes you ! \n\nAll the best to you!",

    "text": "Long and whiny post. Hi all, I am a 27F and am currently working in a doctors office (nothing clinical, just clerical). It’s 16/hour which in Texas seems to not be so low but it definitely feels low considering all my expenses. I live with my roommate and we make the exact same hourly and split everything down the middle. I just moved here last year and have already job hopped A LOT. Most of it due to bad choices on my end and terrible management. \n\n1st job here: at an orthopedics startup where the doctor was alway nodding off in his office and his staff of 3 inexperienced women carried the burden of everyday inquiries. He would also show up late more often than not. I was asked to handle a lot as front desk and I just couldn’t do it all without assistance. He’d push back and say he has all the necessary people and we don’t need anymore help. I think he was just cheap. He also never worked alone at his own practice so he implemented a lot of unnecessary and time wasting duties. \n\n2nd job: call center, at some point, they decided nobody has to Wear a mask and no one has to be vaccinated. I noped out of there so fast. \n\n3rd and current: an ESTABLISHED specialists practice that still has staffing issues. I have to man the phone all day and even have some coworkers blind transfer calls to me. The two women at the front are twice my age yet act very infantile towards the patients. I get it, patients are awful. We have a lot of older patients that have no idea how a doc office operates and their incessant badgering gets annoying. Still, I stay because its 4 miles away and it’s the highest paying job I’ve had. \n\nBack to the point do the post lol. I have trouble socializing and I hardly ever do it at work. I’ll do maybe one group activity but to me, work is work. It’s not a family. I don’t want to be expected to be anyone’s friend. I couldn’t focus in school so I have no degree but notice that when I get a job, I’m told I work very hard and do a good job because again, work is work. I’m willing to adapt and learn. I have a couple relatives that are self employed mostly doing housekeeping and grooming. I envy them. I’ve looked into trade schools but worry that bc I am a women, skilled labor jobs won’t take me in. Is anyone else in a similar boat? I want to work somewhere outside healthcare at this rate, it’s a dumpster fire there.",

    "text": "Worried About My Safety And Mental Health From My Job (FastFood) Posting this on my throwaway account just for safety\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk so Ive been working this job for about 6 months and its my first job ever. I started last august of 2020 and have been working since. Since working ive seen alot of saftey issues and no care for covid ect... I deal with really bad anxiety and have social troubles so thats why I havent really said anything or done anything. Anyway I'll just list off my worries in bullet points. (Also to add I do closing at this fast food restruant)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. For last 2-3 months the people I usually do closing with will not wear there mask unless the boss is there. When the boss leaves they will fully take their mask off or have it under their chin. Usually its for last 2-3 hours before closing when the boss leaves. So I work drive through and the 2 other people both do cooking except for 1 who also can work drive through (Its always just 2 me and someone else when closing) Anyway both dont wear mask when making the food. Also dont wash their hands unless there coming from the bathroom or their hands are wet. Also the one guy who also knows how to work drive though will work drive through with no mask and do the same thing of making food with no mask. (Also all the cooks that work at our store dont wear gloves when making food)\n\n2. I feel like my boss tries to take advantage of me cause she knows I know how to work every station and always work hard. I usually only work 4 days a week but I would say atleast 1 time a week on my day off she will ask if I can come in. I use to say yes but recently I've just been lying saying im busy so I can enjoy my day off since I am already so mentally stressed. I also recently brought up of me going to 2-3 days a week before june as im starting college and want to focus on my majors ect... which she didnt seem happy about and shes been asking me questions about it I guess.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. One of the guys I work with I hate. He came in about 4 months ago but worked morning at the time. Then about 2 months ago he go switched to night shift and since then its been a nightmare to work with him. Hes one of the 2 people that I talked about who doesn't wear his mask ect... He also lazy and I have to make up for his work. Most times when we get a car and its just the 2 of use for closing he will have me do all the work well he sits on his phone. Ive had times where we've had like 3-4 cars and I have to handle everything by myself even though he has a headset on and can hear me take all the orders and thanks to this our times always go to like 10-15min sometimes even close to 20min a order just cause he wont help and im only 1 person. He's also really mean. I think in his head he wants to think its a joke but there have been times where he yells infront of the customers at me saying \"COME ON PICK UP THE PACE'' ect... He also recently been talking about the way I work drive through. He tells me I need to use my man voice and stop using my pussy voice. He says this because I usually talk very montonish and I have a kinda nasily voice. Theres alot of other stuff I can also rant about him but I think sets a stage of what kind of person he is\n\n&#x200B;\n\n   4. Ive been worried for last month that some of my works might have covid. First off this week both of the people who doing closing with me have gotten sick. Monday the guy who I dont like called in and went to the doctors and has something wrong with his throat or something idk the full details, and the other person who works night shift called in sick and I think she was going to the doctors also from what my boss told me. Anyway like I said most of my co-workers dont wear mask and I usually the only one who does. Also some of they have been coughing and now with the 2 people both sick at the same time im a little worried. I actually got a covid test last year in november when I was working and tested negative but I think I might need to get another one cause Im worried since my job takes no steps to protect us and seems like its a covid party ast my job. Also like 95% of customers dont wear there mask also so it could easily be transferred in ect...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway thats my rant/worries. I prob have alot more but those seem to be my main ones off the top of my head. No TLDR for this but please give me some ideas on what to do. I do have a good amount of money saved up so im thinking of looking for another job maybe at bestbuy or something since I have experience on my resume thanks to internships I took during highschool",

    "text": "Fired from McDonald’s Hi, I started working at 2 star McDonald’s because I needed the money, when I got there they were rude and unprofessional and didn’t train me and called me in for orientation and interview the same day. People were getting frustrated with me because it was my first job and I didn’t know how to work anything with no training, I talked to the manger at a McDonald’s closer to my house and he said leave there ASAP they're rude and they don’t train or do anything right. I struggle with anxiety so I struggled to quit especially with people who looked rude, acted rude and were unapproachable. They told me to look at my co-workers to teach me and see what to do and what not to do, I thought it was okay to use your phone because my co-workers were and I was never told not to but I didn’t want to do it in front of customers like my co-workers, so I just went into the bathroom and this woman saw me upset when I went in there so she followed me in there and waited like 10 minutes to say anything then asked if I was okay, I said yes, I just have a family emergency my mom is in the hospital she’s very sick from kidney damage. She says okay, come back to work so we can put you on your break when you’re done using the bathroom and fixing that. I said okay. When I came out this whole other man said he was sending me home and I said okay. I didn’t know what that meant at that time. I went to work the next day and did all my work, even other people’s work and did extra. I suffer from extreme menstrual cramps so every time my period starts I have to go to the gyno to make sure everything is okay, It started and my gyno wanted me to come in and said to ask if I can go in work later and this was urgent because it was not on time. I told my manager what she had said and said if she still wants me to come in to work I can totally do that and hold off the doctor. She said I was unreliable and chose my health over work so she was going to fire me. I told almost everyone about me getting fired because I was so mad at the time, I told my little sister and my older brother, my older brother decided to prank call them and my little sister did it along with him even when I told them do not say a word to them to save me the embarrassment. They called back my brothers number and said they knew who it was because they don’t get prank calls and only one person got fired today then they started cursing at her and saying rude things to her (they thought she was me but I was just in the background listening). I have to go in for my check and to return my uniform and my siblings have completely and utterly embarrassed me, should I still go in or send someone else? They literally think my sister was me because I’m the only one who got fired meanwhile it was just me being an idiot and having no pride and telling people I got fired. I didn’t see anything wrong with being fired simply because I hated the job, was overworked and had 0 training on my 3rd day. I’m still in 8th grade btw.",

    "text": "THINGS EVERY WOMAN SHOULD KNOW ABOUT HER BODY I've met alot of women in my life who were unaware about various things about the female body, myself included. As a teenager, there were alot of things I've learned that I thought was true, only to realize it isn't.\nI wanted to make a post to share things I've learned over the years, and debunk myths.\nThis is mostly aimed at teenage girls/young women. But who knows! Maybe you learn something new aswell, even if you don't fit that category.\n\nIf you have anything you want to add, feel free to do so in the comments!\n\n\n**PEE AFTER SEX**\nPeeing after sex can help to flush bacteria out of the urethra, and therefore help avoiding an UTI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Sex shouldn't hurt your first time**\nPeople make having sex with men as a woman for the first time sound like a complete horror story.\nBut I'm happy to say, it's not!\nIt's normal to feel a little sore afterwards, but it's not supposed to be painful.\nDon't rush it, have fun with eachother. Make out, touch eachother, etc. \nIf it's difficult to insert the penis or if it's painful, leave it be, and do some more foreplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Your vagina is self-cleaning**\nVaginas are self cleaning. You never need to clean the inside of your vagina with water, soap or any other feminine hygiene products. \nThe vulva can be cleaned with a gentle unscented soap if this doesn't irritate you, but can contribute to recurrent yeast infections or Bacterial Vaginosis for some people.\nUsing water alone to clean your vulva is what is recommended by medical professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Having stains on your clean underwear is normal**\nThe vagina has a acidic pH level, that's why discharge can leave stains on your underwear. It's completely normal, and that doesn't mean your underwear isn't clean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Semen can mess up your vaginas pH-level**\nThe optimal vaginal pH level is between 3.8 and 4.5, which makes it acidic. \nSemen and soap have an alkaline pH, in the 7-9 range.\nBecause of this, the presence of semen can elevate your vaginal pH long after sex.\nIf you often have problems with UTIs after having sex, this may be the reason why.\nThe best way to deal with this is using a condom.\n\nEDIT:\nLubed condoms can actually mess with your pH levels aswell.\nMany popular brands of lube/condoms can irritate the vagina due to it's pH level.\n\n- If a product is CE marked, it’s a confirmation that it’s safe for the bodily environment it was intended for, by European Economic Area (EEA) standards. Without this, there’s no confirmation that your lube product doesn’t contain anything that’s harmful to your vulva skin and vaginal pH.\n- Avoid lubes/condoms that have flavors/fragrances such as fruity, floral, candy, etc.\n- Avoid: Glycerin(e), Propylene Glycol, Nonoxynol 9, Chlorhexedine Gluconate, Petroleum Oils, Polyquaternium-15, Benzocaine, Sugars & Sugar Alcohols, Ureas.\n\nThank you u/DiabloStorm for informing me about this!\nHere's a guide about everything to do with lube, I highly recommed it: http://dangerouslilly.com/lube-guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**80% of women don't orgasm from penetrative sex**\nCan't seem to reach an orgasm during penetrative sex? You're definitely not alone!\nThe vast majority of women are only able to orgasm from clitorial stimulation, the clit is the only thing on the human body that exists for pleasure only, after all, experiment with it!\nDon't accept that sex is done when he reaches an orgasm, when he didn't even try to pleasure you aswell.\nYour pleasure is just as important as theirs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Most women don't bleed their first time**\nIn some cultures, a husbands family demands to see bloody sheets after the wedding night, to prove that the bride was a virgin. This is false.\nOnly 1 in 5 women bleed their first time, I didn't bleed the first time I had sex.\nBleeding or not doesn't prove if the women has or hasn't had sex before.\nQuick note: If you're a woman who needs to prove her \"virginity\" by showing bloody sheets on her wedding night, and you're worried that you won't bleed, please DM me. There are multiple ways you can fake bleed, I can help you. Surgery is the worst thing you can do, there are different options that are much better!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Nobody can look inside your vagina and determine if you've had sex or not**\nThere have been cases of people taking their girlfriends/daughters/wives to a gynecologist to see if they have stretched their hymen or not.\nLike the rapper T.I, who took his 18 year old daughter to a gynecologist to get answers.\nThe truth is that no doctor or gynecologist can examine you to see if you've had sex or not, that's something only you know.\nThe hymen can stretch from doing everyday things, running, sports, riding a bike, etc. It has nothing to do with proving if you've had sex or not, it's just impossible to prove that. Some women are born without a hymen.\nPlease don't be discouraged to do sports and other things to avoid streatching your hymen.\nThere's help out there for women who need to prove their \"virginity\" to their boyfriend/father/husband this way. No person should ever do that to you. Please DM me if you're in that situation, I will more than gladly help you.\nVirginity is a made up concept to make people feel ashamed about their sexual experiences or lack there of. Again,  nobody can determine if you've had sex or not.\n\nEDIT:\nThank you u/Chickiri for posting this great and informative comment:\n\n\"While it's not possible to tell wether you're a virgin or not based on the state of your hymen alone, there are ways to detect wether or not you've had sex, which are especially important in the case of rape. If you've been raped/fear you've been raped (if you feel like maybe you've been drugged/intoxicated/any other situation), please seek a professional: this is very important for your health, and for any legal action you might want to take.\"\n\nThis is very important, it's completely understandable if you're afraid to report it. But please go to the hospital first thing, don't shower or change clothes. They will help tremendously, and they won't force you to report if you don't want to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Having large labia minora is normal**\nLabiaplasty is getting more and more popular amongst young women, because they feel like their vulva is \"abnormal\".\nIt isn't, every single vulva is normal. There is not a \"right\" way for a vulva to look. \nThere's a woman and activist called mediclit on twitter, she got a labiaplasty at 18. The procedure left her mutilated, and she no longer have any feeling in her clitoris. If you're interested in this topic, I suggest checking her out.\nPlease be safe!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**It's totally normal for one boob to be bigger than the other**\nIt's way more common to have asymmetrical boobs than have symmetrical ones. It's actually very rare to have perfectly symmetrical boobs, don't worry about it!\nThat being said, if you suddenly develop asymmetry, like a sudden increase or decrase in volume of the boobs, you should get that checked out. That’s especially true if that change comes with other symptoms like skin retraction, or thickening, dimpling, or a change in color of your breast. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**You can get pregnant during your period**\nIt's very unlikely, but it's not impossible.\nOnce inside a woman, sperm can wait for an egg for up to a week. Ovulation can occur soon after, or even during, the bleeding phase of a woman's menstrual cycle, giving the sperm the chance to get lucky. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**The vagina does not become \"loose\" if you have alot of sex**\nEver wondered why men say a woman who've slept with a 100 men have a \"loose\" vagina, but a woman who slept with the same man a 100 times doesn't? Me too!\nThis is simply a slut-shaming tactic, it isn't true. \nVirginity is a social construct, and who many people you've sex with is nobodys business, and it doesn't determine your worth.\nThe vagina can push out an entire baby and go back to its normal size, a dick won't change shit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Birthcontrol isn't only for avoiding pregnancy**\nI had very painful periods as a teenager, had all horrible sideeffects you could think of.\nMy mom suggested that I tried birthcontrol. Her suggestion made me feel embarrassed, I associated birthcontrol with having sex, and I hadn't had sex before at that age.\nShe explained that you can go on birthcontrol even if you aren't sexually active, and she's absolutely right.\nThere's many reasons why a woman would choose to go on birthcontrol, preventing pregnancy is only one of many.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Penetrative sex isn't the only way to have sex**\nThis annoys me alot. As a bisexual woman, I've been asked numerous times how two women have sex. They never ask how two men have sex, why? Because a dick is involved.\nThis is especially irritating considering that only 20% of women are able to orgasm that way.\nTo clarify, sex isn't just being able to orgasm either. But it annoys me that many men totally ignore the part that makes women reach climax, and won't even consider it sex.\nSex is so much more than just penetration, have fun with it, explore.\n\n\n\n\n**Vaginal discharge 101**\nI used Mama Doctor Jones video about discharge to provide pictures to better show what I mean. Thank your everybody who suggested her channel in the comments, very informative, and I highly recommend checking her out, you can find her video [here] (https://youtu.be/KHF8mB_8LUM)\n\nDischarge is a completely normal bodily function that cleans and protects the vagina.\nYour vaginal discharge can vary depending on your cycle, and it can vary from person to person.\nSome of us have alot, some of us have less, it's completely normal.\nI do not recommend wearing pantyliners on a daily basis to prevent getting discharge on your underwear, it can irritate the skin of the vulva. \n\n**Healthy/Normal discharge**\nThe color of vaginal discharge more commenly white or off-white, but sometimes it can have a bit of a yellow hue, and sometimes it can have a more transparent look.\n[Here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHfQyZ.jpg) are some examples of normal consistencies and colors of discharge.\n\n*In the absence of any other symptoms*, these consistencies are completely normal:\n\n- Watery/Clear\n\n- Gel-like \"stringy\" discharge, normally happends before ovulation.\n\n- Also consistencies that I included in the photo.\n\nYour discharge may be a brownish color, this is also normal, reference photo [here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHDEfo.jpg)\nThis is called spotting.\nSpotting is defined as light vaginal bleeding that happens outside of your regular periods.\nThis kind of brown discharge can often happend at the end of your cycle. It's old blood mixed with discharge, which creates a brown-like color.\n\n**Abnormal discharge**\nFirst of all, it's important to recognise how your discharge usually smell like. It shouldn't smell foul, but it's normal to have a smell or lack of it. If it does have a funny smell, it's a sign that you should get it checked up.\n\nCottage cheese-like chunks in your vaginal discharge, looks like [this] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHlZIV.jpg)\n\nThis can often signify a yeast infection.\nEspecially if it's followed by any of these symptoms:\n\n- Genital Itching \n\n- Swelling\n\n- Redness \n\n- Burning sensation while peeing or having penetrative sex\n\n- Your discharge might smell a little \"off\" if you have a yeast infection, but it can also have no odor at all.\n\n\nTREATMENT:\nIf it's your first time having an yeast infection, or if you're unsure if it is an yeast infection or not, make an appointment to your doctor.\n\nOtherwise, you can buy a over-the-counter yeast treatment. (Not recommended for pregnant women, book an appointment)\nIf your symptoms persists, book an appointment.\n\nDon't be embarrassed if you have a yeast infection, it's very common but unpleasant. Don't be afraid to seek treatment.\n\nTo reduce your risk of vaginal yeast infections: \n\n- Wear underwear that has a cotton crotch and doesn't fit too tightly.\n\nAvoid:\n\n- Tight-fitting pantyhose\n\n- Douching, which removes some of the normal bacteria in the vagina that protect you from infection\n\n- Scented feminine products, including bubble bath, pads and tampons\n\nThe following may increase your likelihood of yeast infections:\n- Stress\n\n- Diabetes\n\n- Use of birth control pills\n\n- Pregnancy\n\n- Antibiotics, especially prolonged use over 10 days\n\n\n\n\nAlot of yellow discharge that looks like [this] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHs8JF.jpg) especially if you have other symptoms could indicate chlamydia.\nA slight yellow hue can be normal in certain situations. But if you feel other symptoms, or if you recently had sex with a new person, you should get that checked out.\nRemember! Some people don't have any symptoms when they have chlamydia. Untreated chlamydia can result in serious health complications, such as pelvic inflammatory disease.\nThat's why it's very important to use a condom when having sex, and get tested if you have any doubts.\n\nIf you suspect that you have any kind of STI or STDs, seek medical treatment.\n\nLime green discharge, that kinda looks like mucus in my opinion, reference [here]\n(https://pasteboard.co/JZHvzad.jpg)\nAnd [here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHvNlq.jpg)\nIf you have a new sexpartner or in any situation where you can be at risk for STI or STDs, this can indicate gonorrhea or trichomoniasis.\n\nSymptoms of trichomoniasis:\n- Itching, burning, redness or soreness of the genitals\n\n-Discomfort with urination\n\n-A change in their vaginal discharge (i.e., thin discharge or increased volume) that can be clear, white, yellowish, or greenish with an unusual fishy smell\n\nSymptoms of gonorrhea:\n- an unusual vaginal discharge, which may be thin or watery and green or yellow in colour\n\n- Pain or a burning sensation when peeing\n\n- Pain or tenderness in the lower abdominal area  (this is less common)\n\n- Bleeding between periods, heavier periods and bleeding after sex (this is less common)\n\nIf you suspect that you have any kind of STI or STD, seek medical attention.\n\nIf your discharge have a thin, gray color, it can indicate bacterial vaginosis. Couldn't find a good reference photo for this one, sorry about that.\n\nWhat is bacterial vaginosis?\nBacterial vaginosis is a type of vaginal inflammation caused by the overgrowth of bacteria naturally found in the vagina, which upsets the natural balance.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Grey-like discharge\n\n-Discharge have a strong fishy odor\n\n- Burning feeling when you pee\n\n- Itching\n\n50% of women do not have any symptoms.\n\nWhen to see a doctor:\n\n-You have vaginal discharge that's new and associated with an odor or fever. Your doctor can help determine the cause and identify signs and symptoms.\n\n- You've had vaginal infections before, but the color and consistency of your discharge seems different this time.\n\n- You have multiple sex partners or a recent new partner. Sometimes, the signs and symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection are similar to those of bacterial vaginosis.\n\n- You try self-treatment for a yeast infection with an over-the-counter treatment and your symptoms persist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)**\nTSS is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by bacteria getting into the body and releasing harmful toxins.\nThis can affect both men, women and children.\nRisk factors for toxic shock syndrome include skin wounds, surgery, and the use of tampons.\nHaving your tampons in for longer than 8-12 hours can increase the risk of an infection or TSS.\n\nSymptoms:\nThe symptoms of toxic shock syndrome start suddenly and get worse quickly. They include:\n\n- A high temperature\n\n- Flu-like symptoms, such as a headache, feeling cold, feeling tired or exhausted, an aching body, a sore throat and a cough\n\n- Feeling and being sick\n\n- Diarrhoea\n\n- A widespread sunburn-like rash\n\n- Lips, tongue and the whites of the eyes turning a bright red\n\n- Dizziness or fainting\n\n- Difficulty breathing\n\n- Confusion\n\nTSS is very rare, but these symptoms should absolutely not be ignored, if you experience these symptoms, contact medical emergencies immediately. If you're using a tampon while experiencing these symptoms, remove it straight away. Inform medical staff if have used a tampon while experiencing these symptoms.\n\n\n\nLike I said, feel free to add anything if I forgot about something.\n\nI hope you all have an amazing day!\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nThank you so much for the awards and positive comments. \nYour comments warms my heart, I'm so glad that many of you have found it helpful.\n\nSeeing that many parents show their daughters and sons my post makes me so incredibly proud of myself, you have no idea how much it means to me.\n\n\nI'm happy that many women and girls are comfortable  enough to DM me with questions about their body, questions that they're afraid to ask in real life.\nI'm very happy to answer questions to the best of my ability, but please remember that I'm not a medical professional.",

    "text": "My breast reduction surgeon wants me to ‘consider my future husband’ when it comes to how small I want to go I (21) have wanted to have a reduction ever since I realized I would be much larger than average, probably when I was 15. I’m 5 feet tall but I wear a 36G. They are uncomfortable, annoying, and very disproportionate to the rest of my body. I was finally approved for the procedure through my insurance and was very excited to get this off my chest (pun intended). I was so disappointed when the highly recommended surgeon shot down my desire to be reduced to a B cup because of ‘my future husband’. I was shocked and didn’t know how to reply. I  didn’t want to out myself as a lesbian to this complete stranger, but I also didn’t think I should have to justify what I wanted to do by saying a man wouldn’t be involved. We left the appointment without agreeing on a size and I am supposed to come back after ‘thinking it over’. I have already been waiting and thinking for six months since I spoke to my insurance company. Should I try to change surgeons? I want to get this done as soon as possible, but the whole experience with the doctor made me feel hesitant to go through with him.\n\nUPDATE: I’ve had many helpful comments about how the jump from G to B is a big one and might have complications. I am 100% aware of this- the nurse who spoke to me first made this very clear, and I was fine with that! I just want to be able to do normal activities and I was hopeful that I could get down to a B. The doctor didn’t give me any medical reason not to go through with this size, instead choosing to tell me what my future spouse would/wouldn’t like.",

    "text": "My sister's fiance last minute called off their engagement after finding out that she will most likely not be able to have children naturally.. Seeing my sister process this has reminded me of how resilient women are when we need to be. One of my sisters (31f) got engaged last summer to the man she has been with for six years. My whole family loved him and of course were thrilled about the engagement. Starting in October, my sister began experiencing some issues with her period and severe cramping pain. She went to her doctor for routine testing. What she thought would be a quickly diagnosable and easily fixed health situation, turned into a lot more. After a few months of more invasive testing, she was told the news that she has a condition that will make her odds of getting pregnant naturally very, very low. Not impossible, but very low.\n\nWhen she called me crying, I booked a ticket that night to fly and see her. She is my best friend. I expected the visit to be full of long walks and sister time, with nights spent hanging out at her house with her fiancé, but once I arrived I realized that wasn't going to be the case. I got there a few hours after her fiancé had left. She told me he had shut down and told her he needed to go see his family for a weekend away to process the news. \n\nRather than being able to spend the weekend helping her begin to process significant personal news around her body and future pregnancy odds, we spent most of that first weekend processing her fiancé’s reaction.\n\nLong story short, her fiancé returned after the weekend and they spent a few weeks together before he ultimately called off the engagement. His reasoning was that going into marriage, he felt it was extremely important for him to know with certainty that he could make a family with his future wife naturally. He just couldn't in good faith go forward with the marriage with his new understanding of their odds (is what she told me he said). \n\nShe let him go without a fight or a bad word. I couldn't believe this (being stubborn and very pissed off myself by his behavior). But she told me that while she was devastated, his words gave her a lot of clarity: she had dodged a bullet not signing on to a life with a man who would run at the first sign of their life diverging from his expectations. She wanted someone who loved her through this kind of news. She didn't feel the need to tell him this. She just said goodbye and wished him happiness. \n\nNow, everyone is entitled to their own priorities for marriage. Do I understand how he could have found something out like that about a woman he had loved for six years, only to turn around and abandon her? No. Am I biased because we are talking about my sister who I am extremely protective of? Yes. This post isn't intended to spark negative conversation around my sister's ex-fiancé for his decision. Good luck to him.. It is intended to share my perspective around how insanely resilient my sister - and I am sure so many other women who face fertility challenges or called off engagements or marriages - are.\n\nMy sister told me that initially hearing that she may not be able to have a child of her own felt like  a core part of her self identity had suddenly been ripped away. She told me that she felt the most alone she ever has - and seeing her fiance shut down only added to that. But, she told me that within 48 hours of the doctor's appointment, she decided she wasn't going to let this deter her from moving forward happily. I have watched her first-hand over the past few months take ownership over addressing the hardest of emotions in the best way she can. She got an amazing therapist. She requested some time off from work to process. She coordinated a move across the country with poise and a big smile - choosing to let herself feel excited for a new beginning despite the pain she was feeling around the closure of her last chapter.\n\nMost importantly,  she has let me and my family - and her closest friends - support her. She has let me sit with her for hours in silence as she cries and processes in weaker moments. She has let me take her out for dinners where we drink too many margaritas and watch a terrible movie laughing at all of the terrible jokes. She has let me and others help temporarily fill some of the holes that were created by her pregnancy news and losing her fiancé. Holes that - as she so poignantly said - feel like trenches right now, but overtime will shrink. She has joined infertility support groups online, even meeting a few amazing women in person in our city who she says have helped her immensely. She went on a date last weekend and called me dying laughing after reflecting on how absurdly poorly the night went.\n\nAnyways, just wanted to share an example of how resilient women are. Even in the most challenging of situations, we can figure out the ways to move forward constructively and freely, taking a higher road. I also wanted to share how important it can be to let other women and people in to help when you are struggling. I know my sister would say the same.",

    "text": "My gynaecologist said he “doesn’t care” in the best way possible. I’m 38. I had my daughter when I was 21, and when she was a month and a half old her father died in a car accident. I knew right away I didn’t want another child because I didn’t want children from more than one man. No judgement to those of you that have, but because of my upbringing I just didn’t feel comfortable, that’s a whole other story though.\n\nI asked about getting my tubes tied in my 20s, my family doctor said no, without even a referral to a gyno. You ladies know his reasoning, some imaginary man I hadn’t met might want to someday impregnate me. \n\n Fast forward to the present. Last month I had my IUD removed and I told my present doctor that I wanted a tubal and ablation rather than another IUD so he referred me to a gynaecologist. Today was my appointment. I explained that I have brutal periods that have landed me in the hospital a few times and I’m just done with them and looking for a more permanent solution. \n\nHe gave me 3 options; another IUD, the tubal and ablation I had requested, OR a hysterectomy. I GET TO DECIDE!! BY MYSELF! He explained all options thoroughly and why he thought hysterectomy should also be an option for me, but he said ultimately it’s up to me, HE DOESN’T CARE what I choose. He flat out said he has no idea what I’ve been through or what a period even feels like, so only I can decide what is right for me. No judgement or pressure, just education and options. I see him again after Christmas to let him know my decision and schedule the procedure of my choice. I feel so empowered, I’m finally “old” enough to make decisions about my body.\n\n All 3 procedures have pros and cons, obviously, and if any of you want to share your wisdom and experiences that would be wonderful. Right now I’m leaning towards getting a hysterectomy and just being 100% done with my period forever.",

    "text": "The \"Husband Stitch\" So a few years ago my husband told me that the doctor who delivered his brother asked his dad if he wanted a \"couple of extra stitches thrown in there\" while her episiotomy was being closed. Of course I found this offensive and angering, and a joke in extremely bad taste. \n\nThis morning the topic came around again, and I mused that, back in the '70's, doctors might have actually *done* that shit. My husband scoffed at me and said \"No way,\" and I agreed. I was probably just being bitter bc his dad is a sexist asshole. (Ex: took pictures of other women in bikinis on a family vacation with the family camera, got them developed, and they're still in their photo box.) Out of curiosity, I decided to google \"husband stitch\" to reassure myself that it was an urban legend. \n\n**I was so. Fucking. Naive.**\n\nThe \"husband stitch\" was [totally](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/husband-stitch-is-not-just-myth#The-history-of-episiotomies,-from-popular-to-discouraged) [real.](https://granta.com/the-husband-stitch/) My husband and I just stared at each other open-mouthed for a second because it seemed like such an evil, misogynistic violation that it couldn't be real. But it is. \n\nFor those that don't know, the practice involves putting extra stitches in the vagina to make it \"tighter\" for the man's pleasure because men are still terrified that childbirth makes pussies loose. That's not true, and it also shouldn't be a fucking priority after you just had an infant. The practice can cause a host of complications for women, most frequently **pain during intercourse.** But that's a petty concern when compared to a man's right to fuck. This can affect husbands, too, because it really messes up their sex life. (Hope it was fucking worth it, asshole.)\n\nI took the practice to be separate from an episiotomy, which I thought was a medical procedure, but my husband made a great point: episiotomies used to be routine because they didn't want the vagina torn too much, and he asked me if I thought that was out of concern for the woman. \"No,\" he said, \"the interest in preventing tearing was **also** to keep the husband's vagina nice and tight and pretty looking.\" I had to admit that he was right. (And I was also secretly proud of him. I hit the man jackpot!) \n\nThe \"husband stitch\" is still performed today, and I truly wonder how many women even get asked or told about it.\n\nEven after being on the planet for 43 years, this practice still shocks the **fuck** out of me. One woman described \"laying there like a lump\" while the husband and doctor discussed the extra stitches, ignoring her completely. I always worry about being one of those stereotypical \"angry, man-hating\" feminists, but I'm so fucking tired of men thinking they have any amount of privilege or control over our bodies!!! This stitch shit is fucking crazy! \n\nIt's nothing but a subtle admission that a lot of men see women as non-sentient fuck-holes that only exist to pleasure them. Look at they way they flipped their shit about #MeToo, when it was made loud and clear that they don't just get free access to our bodies whenever it strikes their fancy. And i **know** women have it relatively good in America, but I can't believe that we still have this far to go. And to be brutally honest, I am finding it hard **not** to despise men just a little bit for thinking they're owed a tighter pussy because they were generous enough to let us have their baby. **Fuck that.**\n\nMy husband was appalled, too, but I really needed to rant at some fellow women. Thanks for putting up with me :) Stay safe and healthy out there!\n\nEdit: 20 seconds and the post gets downvoted. I'm gonna throw caution to the wind and assume it's a guy throwing a tantrum because he doesn't like being told that our bodies don't belong to him. How about that person simply respect us out of common fucking courtesy, since it's always the **obviously correct** choice, and just go on from there.\n\nEdit2: **STEPS TO TAKE TO PROTECT OURSELVES**: Fuck genital mutilation, ya'll! From what I have read, there are a couple of simple things we can do to avoid this bullshit:\n\n1. Find an OBGYN that you trust (good advice for all of us!)\n\n2.  Talk to them about how you would like your birth to go and try to establish some kind of plan. Keep it short and simple, say 3 of your most important thoughts. It's always helpful to bring an advocate with you (this is usually the husband if it's an obstetrics appt, but it can be anyone you trust and who knows what you want to achieve.)\n\n3. Ask the OBGYN **what their policy is regarding episiotomies.** Ask them how often they do them and how they decide that it's necessary. *Tell them you would prefer you don't have one if at all possible,* although sometimes they are needed in emergent situations. Use your voice, say that shit - doctors work for *you.*\n\n4. Tell them that you don't want the husband stitch, and if they try to laugh it off, tell them what you know about it and that it's a real thing. Don't let them intimidate you, you have the right to tell them what is and isn't acceptable. If you have an advocate or support, bring them too if it will help.\n\n5. This is unofficial, but I'm a nurse, so: **do your own research before your appointment. ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF**, because a lot of doctors (sorry if I offend, and I'm only speaking from *my* experience) are supercilious man-splainers that are used to having their ass kissed constantly. (And you should see the difference in the way most male doctors talk to female nurses vs. male nurses. But that's another post.) **Don't take that bullshit.** Ask them however many questions you want, make them explain anything you aren't sure you're solid on, ask about meds, ask about anesthesia, bring something to write on. If they order tests, ask them what they're for - doctors will order Bullshit tests to get a few extra bucks from your insurance. (I have seen this happen at nearly every floor I've worked on. It's especially bad if you have Medicare - they charge the fuck out of Medicare.) When it's all over, **ask for an itemized bill.** If something seems bogus, call the office and make them give you an explanation.\n\n6. Again: Use your voice. Advocate for yourself (and the rest of us ladies will benefit, too!) I can't say that enough. Don't let anyone blow you off or condescend to you, and don't leave until you have the information you want. **I love you guys! Stay safe and healthy and vaginally perfect out there!! I know it's painful And upsetting to read about this shit, but THIS IS HOW WE MAKE LIFE BETTER for ALL of us. You're amazing, and i believe in you!**\n\nEdit3: Guys, my inbox is freaking blowing up and i can't answer everybody. **Thank you so much for the awards and the kind words!** I was mortified by this and really needed to talk to some women (I've got some anxiety issues - but who doesn't after 2020), and you guys have helped me so much! Spread the word about this misogynistic fuckery to all the ladies you love of child-bearing years, and keep on being wonderful human beings! <3 <3\n\n**Edit 4: What can we do to raise awareness and hold doctors accountable?** I slept on this, and I have some ideas, but I also need your help. Here are my thoughts: I'm a member of the Satanic Temple, and they do a lot of activism regarding bodily autonomy. This issue seems to be right in their wheelhouse. They have funds and they have lawyers. I think it's worth it for me to email them about this - even if they don't pick it up right away, at least it will put the bug in their ear. I have a friend back in Boston who knows one of the ST founders, and i am going to get him to work this into a convo with Doug sometime. That's one way to raise awareness about this. But what else? How do we find women who have been victims of this? Do we set up a website where they can self report? Does anyone know how to do that, because I'm shit with that kind of thing. Are there any lawyers reading who could give advice? What do you guys think? Can we create a space where we can talk about/collaborate on this - maybe a Slack workspace or something? **What are your thoughts?**",

    "text": "I've had 3 abortions I've had 3 abortions.\n\nMy first abortion was when I was 18. My partner was using a condom that broke, but they never told me it did. I was not emotionally ready for a child. I had the abortion at 6 weeks 6 days\n\nMy 2nd abortion was when I was 19. After my experience at 18, I started taking birth control pills, and used a condom with a new partner. That condom broke. My partner immediately told me, and I breathed a sigh of relief because I knew I was taking pills. 6 weeks later I was 8 weeks between periods. I was not emotionally ready for a child. I had the abortion at 7 weeks 4 days.\n\nMy 3rd abortion was when I was 25. I was living in another country and thought I was absolutely in love with a man I met there. I found out he was cheating, with multiple women, and had lied about his background. At the same time of these other discoveries, I learned that I was pregnant and he moved to another city within days of me showing him the test results and had no way of contacting him. The one friend I had native to the country offered to help me. She took a day off of work (which is unheard of in this country) and took me to a medical facility. Her English fell short and my minimal understanding of the native language was utterly useless. I realized I was on morphine and escorted to a table with a black bagged trash can between the stirrups. The last thing I remember was a nurse kindly wiping my tears away while another told the doctor \"the foreigner is crying\". This was a devastating experience. I physically recovered quickly and my elderly neighbor brought me food for a week even though we couldn't communicate. Clearly my friend had asked her to check on me. I was not emotionally ready for a child nor did I want to have a child with a deceptive person. I had the abortion at 7 weeks and 4 days. (weirdly same as the 2nd)\n\nWhen I was 26, I was back in the States and was living with someone I'd known for years, who knew everything about my life, including the abortions, and loved me whole heartedly because the abortions do not define me or stain my character. We got pregnant. We were shocked, worried that we weren't ready, but knew we wanted to bring a child into the world together, and trusted ourselves to step up. Almost 8 months later, we brought our son home from the hospital.\n\nIf I was forced to suffer the failures of what sex-ed and frigid, uncommunicative parents taught me, I would not have been able to achieve any of my successes and my life (and the lives of any children forced to suffer my limitations) would be totally debilitated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to share my story because for so long I felt like this is a shameful part of my past. But you know what? I'm not ashamed anymore. I am so grateful for the choices I've been able to make. I am not promiscuous, I am not frivolous. I made choices based on whats right for me and now I make choices based on whats right for me and my family.\n\nI can't imagine being deprived of that choice.\n\n\\[this is a throw away account\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: **This community is amazing**. To those sharing your own experiences, thank you SO much for doing so. All of the kind comments and support GREATLY outweigh the negativity. The stigma surrounding abortion is a direct threat to a woman's wellbeing, safety, and their right to control their own life and body. It took a lot for me to write this post. I hope these experiences become easier for others to share, without feeling the need to do so through a throw away account. Be well.",

    "text": "Why are many gynecological procedures done without pain medicine? I am so fucking tired of the discrimination that women face when it comes to medical treatment. From being gaslighted, denied therapy or misdiagnosed, this discrimination often costs women their lives.\n\nOne particular horrible mistreatment of women is the performance of gynecological procedures without pain medication or anesthetic.\n\nIf someone were to take a biopsy of the scrotum, you sure as hell know they would numb the area. Hell, often they put numbing medicine in the shaft of male penises for just inserting a foley! The cervix has sensation. Why are cervical biopsies taken without numbing? Why are endometrial biopsies taken without numbing medicine? Why are IUDs inserted without numbing?\n\nIt is horrific. I’ve had an IUD inserted and I went hypotensive and passed out from the pain. I had to be monitored for several hours afterward. Why is this permitted? How can we change it?\n\nI would love to start a letter writing campaign to ACOG and give them a piece of my mind.\n\n[https://www.acog.org/](https://www.acog.org/)\n\nAnyone else willing to join?\n\nSide note, they don’t even teach doctors the nerve to the clitoris and often this nerve isn’t spared during labiaplasty leading to permanent sexual dysfunction. What the literal fuck.\n\nEdit: please note that I am not referring to narcotics. I am referring to injections of lidocaine which the doctor is completely capable of doing but won’t.\n\nEdit: My post has been shared on [boredpanda](https://www.boredpanda.com/people-disscuss-gynecological-procedures-without-pain-meds/), [Scary Mommy](https://www.scarymommy.com/viral-thread-gynecological-procedures-without-pain-meds/), [Yahoo News](https://news.yahoo.com/women-sharing-medical-procedures-ve-151602951.html) and [buzzfeed!](https://www.buzzfeed.com/victoriavouloumanos/gynecological-procedures-without-anesthetics-or-pain-meds)\n\nEdit: Below is a template for a letter draft for all those who want to participate.\n\nSend these letters to:\n\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and GynecologistsPO Box 96920, Washington, DC 20024-9998\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDear American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\nI am writing you with the voices of the many women who receive care at your hands every year to deliver a critical message:\n\nYour procedures hurt. It is not just a pinch or a moment. It is horrifically painful and tortuous. It is not over in a short time, many women experience pain afterwards.\n\nNo I am not overreacting. No I am not dramatic. The pain is real. Don’t ask why I am crying. I am crying because it hurts. It hurts horrifically.\n\nThe cervix has nerve endings. Please stop telling patients that it doesn’t. Please stop telling us it doesn’t hurt that bad. It hurts that bad.\n\nYou might look back and think that what was done in the past in the world of gynecology and obstetrics was barbaric, but I am here to tell you, what you continue to do to women is barbaric.\n\nReduction of cost for an individual doctor in a procedure is not a justification for torturing women. I don’t care if it is an inconvenience to you. Provide me with the numbing injections or pain relief if you are going to inflict pain on MY body should be the bare minimum expectation for quality care for women.\n\nYou would never do a scrotal biopsy without numbing medication. Even foley insertions in men often get lidocaine jelly. So, WHY do you take biopsies from my cervix and uterus without numbing it first? If you can’t numb it, then why are those procedures done on awake women? Why do you use horrific hooks to grab my cervix and shove dilators in them to then put in an IUD. I am not the only one who screams out in pain or vomits or passes out. How long do you intend to gaslight us?\n\nHaving gone through childbirth before is not a reason for you to tell me to toughen up or that I should be able to “handle this pain”. I shouldn’t be required to handle anything. You would never expect a man to go through this, why are you making women?\n\nI don’t want to hear your excuses anymore. I want to be treated with respect and dignity. Please change the way you practice medicine. Provide appropriate numbing and pain relief for your procedures. Frankly, it is medical malpractice if you don’t.\n\nEnd the torture of women.\n\nSincerely,",

    "text": "I am so tired of people rambling about how men aren't allowed to express emotions... insinuating that women are. OH MY GOD.\n\nSo I was, admittedly, raised in one of the most misogynistic communities in the United States.\n\nI was raised in Mormon Utah. I was actually born in a place called Swedetown, which was settled in the 30s (there was a huge Scandinavian migration to Utah then, long story). My dad's parents were born in Sweden. They sent my dad to a public high school where he met my mom, who was a mainstream Mormon.\n\nI give you that background because I acknowledge they are some of the most misogynistic people in this country. but:\n\nIt's ironic. I can't wholly articulate it, but people believe women are more emotional, and believe people ALLOW them to be more emotional, which actually makes it so that women are criticized WAY more and are barred from expressing themselves, less they be labeled \"hysterical.\"\n\nLike, when I was a kid, I have so many memories of being told to shut the fuck up, that i was being annoying and unreasonable. Like, when I was 7 I fell off the tramp and I cried and cried and cried for 24+ hours and my mom told me to shut up until she finally realized I broke my arm the next morning and finally took me to the doctor.  \n\n\nI cried when I was bullied in school. of course immediately it was, oh EMOTIONAL hypersensitive girl is just being annoying and \"looking for attention,\" ground her.\n\nWhen my brother cried, it was seen as like... oh, poor guy :( something really must be wrong :( and my parents did anything they could to help him.\n\nwhen I cried, it was like... oh my god you annoying stupid bitch!! so dramatic!!...\n\nI am now 27 but feel like it's basically the same. When I show emotion, I am criticized brutally. It is assumed to be frivolous. I must be \"attention seeking.\" But when a man cries, oh, it must be a REAL problem.",

    "text": "What my violent ex-husband learned at a court-required anger management course TL;DR: >!When my violent ex-husband went to an anger management course after he assaulted me, he learned that if you tidy up all the evidence of having beaten your wife, the police will believe you, not her. This turned out to be correct and kept me trapped with him for an additional year.!<\n\nWhen I met my exhusband, he was sweet and kind and attentive. After we'd been together for a while, he had an 'episode' where he slammed me against a car and shook me. He thought I'd been cheating. I quit seeing him for a couple of months, but he kept calling and I agreed to come back if he got counseling.\n\nHe pretended to go to counseling and things settled down. There were a few minor things that happened along the way, which of course I regret giving him the benefit of the doubt on. We got married, and that was when the nightmare began.\n\nI was no longer a girlfriend he wanted to keep, I was suddenly \"HIS WIFE\" and thus his property. Two weeks after we were married, he had an episode of extreme violence. I still didn't learn my lesson, and after four months apart and him going to court-ordered anger management, I stupidly went back. We had been dating, he had been kind, attentive, and \"himself\" once more for months.\n\nWhen I went back, he escalated immediately. He created several scenes at my work and got me fired. He wrecked my car. He told all of the neighbors that I had early-onset dementia and if they ever saw me leave, they should call him. He would literally come get me and drag me screaming for help into his van. The neighbors would WATCH, shaking their heads in pity. That poor man and his crazy wife... He had shown them (fake) doctor's notes about it. They believed him, never once called the cops.\n\nEventually, I found out about a local battered women's shelter. I hid in the bathroom and called on an old, inactive cellphone. When he heard the police coming, he quickly rearranged the house. He had ripped one of the blinds down. He put it back. He quickly put the lamp he threw back on the end table. He smirked, looked me in the face and said, \"You know what I learned from the other guys at anger management? If you clean up and nothing looks out of place, the police won't believe your bitch wife. You're never getting out of here.\"\n\nI did eventually talk those officers into taking me to the battered women's shelter, but it was incredibly difficult. I demanded to be taken to a hospital if they believed his lies about dementia.\n\nI shouldn't have had to fight police to get to a battered women's shelter. The cops kept telling me, \"They won't take you. You're not battered. You're fine. Why would they take you? HE NEVER HIT YOU.\"\n\nYou know what his statement was? He lit my clothes on fire while I was wearing them. He held me down with his hand over my nose and mouth. He slammed me against the wall so hard I had bruises all the lengths of my back and hips. BUT.... \"I never hit you even once.\"\n\nThe thing is, people kept telling me, \"Why didn't you just leave?\" Even the cops said, \"If it's that bad, just leave.\"\n\nI TRIED to leave. I wish people would understand that it's not as simple as \"just leave\" and that no, the police do NOT always automatically believe the woman. Not at all. Getting an order of protection against him was a whole other nightmare, and it shouldn't have been.\n\nI'm tired of hearing \"cops always believe the woman\" as if it's universal and immutable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you so, so, so much. I really just needed to talk about this yesterday, in a safe way. I'm so grateful right now for the sub and for the people who were so kind and understanding. I can't tell you how much I needed it yesterday and last night. It's been over a decade since I escaped, and I'm safe now and he moved on long ago. I don't know what it was yesterday that brought it on outside of seeing yet another \"cops always believe the woman\" post that was the straw on the camel's back, I guess.\n\nWhatever it was, I did not expect such a kind and overwhelming response. Thank you. I'm so sorry to those who have also been through this. I shouldn't be surprised that there are so MANY of us.\n\nIf you're in an abusive situation right now, you're not alone. You're not the only one. You matter. You can escape, you're stronger than you can even imagine right now. Don't be afraid to start over if that's what needs to happen. You can. You will. You ARE strong enough. S/He won't change. Ever.\n\nYou ARE lovable and s/he's NOT the only one who can ever love you. S/He's terrified you'll realize that. There are billions of wo/men on this planet and there are load of wonderful ones. You don't need them.\n\nAnyone of any gender who's reading this. You are lovable. You don't need that abuser in your life. She or he or they won't change if they haven't yet. Go. You're stronger than you can ever imagine. Be free. It will be rough but you have what it takes. You don't have to feel that you have it, just take the first terrifying steps. Those really are the hardest.",

    "text": "24-year-old unvaccinated pregnant sister is currently intubated a week after her positive covid results We tried so dam hard. She (24) and her husband (27) fell into the conspiracy trap with vaccines and the \"it's no worse than the flu\" line, regardless, we told her **so. many. times** to get vaccinated, week after week, article after article, but she wouldn't listen, especially where she lives in (Texas) and the mindset there.\n\nShe's a little overweight but otherwise healthy and with no health issues at all, her husband is morbidly obese, they have a child who just turned one and she was pregnant with another on the way. Somehow her husband had a very mild covid experience, testing negative twice just a week after his positive results and is good to go (seriously lucky imo), my sister however deteriorated quickly. We told her to get a pulse oximeter and after 5 days her oxygen went down to 90, she went to the hospital, and in a matter of just 3 days she was airlifted to a hospital with room in the ICU (Texas) and intubated. Before being intubated she had to sign documents giving doctors permission to perform an emergency c-section if needed. She has currently been intubated for 3 days, they've been able to lower her oxygen to 80% without issue so there's been a little improvement, but honestly, it's all up in the air at the moment because it's a huge gamble.\n\nRight before she was intubated she called the family at 2 in the morning to say her possible final goodbyes and she wrote a message to the family telling everyone who wasn't vaccinated to do so, as well as making a post on FB describing her experience and telling everyone to get vaccinated, so far 4/5 family members that previously weren't vaccinated got vaccinated except my Grandma (but that's a story for another day, atm me and all my siblings are planning an intervention this Saturday with the codename \"Operation: Save Grandma\" so we'll see how that goes), so at least some good has come out of it. \n\nIt's such a wild mix of emotions, up until intubation we felt bad of course but at the same time we all said she made her decision and we at least tried and left it at that, tbh my Mom went *in* at her a couple of times to knock some sense into her after her positive results, but now that she's intubated we, of course, want her to come out of this and we're seriously hoping she does, but fuck man, the stubbornness is what gets to us, why take a chance with a new baby and another on the way? \n\nTwo of my friends who had pregnant wives got vaccinated in the second trimester with no issues and after some tests both babies have covid antibodies, while relatively new, studies back up that being vaccinated while pregnant is fine, getting covid while pregnant and having a weakened immune system on top though? Absolutely not.\n\nMy sister may very well die at the age of 24 with a 1-year-old and another on the way, this could have all been avoided, please just get vaccinated, **please.**",

But I am a young woman and that is all they ever see.\n\nToday I was filling in at a different pharmacy so I don't know their regulars and the patients don't know me. An old man (about 60 y/o) walks in and the first thing he says is about how attractive he finds me. I try to stay polite, thank him for the compliment and get to business, asking about medications. He kind of answers my questions but keeps describing how beautiful he finds me, which is getting tedious at this point. He literally complimented every single part of me he could see, my face, my eyes, my hair, my nails, my skin.\n\nBut THEN.

How in hell did he think that was an appropriate thing to say to a medical professional???????\n\nMy colleagues said this perverted asshole is a regular customer and is always like that but never went that far.\n\n\nEDIT: I just talked to the regular pharmacist who is also a young woman (we graduated together) and she said this exact same thing happened to her on her first week here. Apparently this sicko likes to taunt new hires. He also talks to everyone this way, stops complete strangers on the street to say how they are not from bad stock, how their legs are not bad, he doles out these weird ass comments to anyone and everyone. We are pretty sure he talks to the dead bodies and just can't stop being weird out on the streets.",

    "text": "I’m breaking up with my boyfriend of nearly ten years. *UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM.*\n\nHe gets home from work in about an hour. I moved my belongings into the spare room where I’ll be staying for the next week until I can move in with my sister.    \nWe were each other’s firsts for everything. We got together in high school. We were so proud of ourselves and how we communicated every issue before they became issues. And we finally moved in together back in August 2020.    \nThis past year has changed everything. I was diagnosed with PTSD and bipolar 2, and also came out as bisexual. He is epileptic and had a seizure in October, resulting in a torn rotator cuff, and I was forced to drive him everywhere for six months while he “promised” to go in to the doctor but always came up with a convenient excuse. My resentment towards him led to fights, and those fights led to stress, and that stress caused more seizures. I quickly learned to keep my mouth shut, or else things would get worse.    \nI’ve watched him devolve from the man I planned to grow old with to a deep spiral of self-loathing. He started using a dab pen to help with his seizures, then more often for his anxiety, and now he claims he can’t sleep without a hit. He’s even a day drinker now, and the other day I found him downing a beer before work. He only started properly cleaning the house because our landlord is taking tours through - even then, he does a piss-poor job and I have to go back through and do it again.    \nThe official deal breaker though was Sunday night. We’d just gotten back from a trip with his family, and our landlord messaged us to clean the house for a tour in the morning. She also said that since we haven’t taken proper care of the lawn, she would be having a service come through and take care of it at 6AM.    \nBoyfriend started pacing the house, asking me not to touch him or talk to him, while also venting to me about how angry he was, and how irrational landlord is. He was slamming things around while “cleaning” which meant he was only carrying items from one room to another.    \nRemember when I said I was diagnosed with PTSD? That’s from my verbally and emotionally abusive father. Dad paced the house when he was angry - if you dared tell him he was wrong or even try to help him, he would scream in your face, throw things around the room, smash bottles on the ground, eventually kick you out if you didn’t stop.   \nWhile boyfriend was angrily pacing, I was frozen - my usual trauma response. I was scared to move, or to talk, or ignore him, anything. And all I could think was “I shouldn’t be scared of the one I love. I can’t end up like mom.”    \nWhen this relationship started, I told him that my deal breaker was if he started acting like my dad. I didn’t think it would actually happen, but here we are. He told me on our trip that he was saving up for an engagement ring. I know he’s planning to propose in three months on our ten year anniversary.    \nI’m typing this up on the living room couch. I’m an anxious ball of nerves and just watching out the window for his car. Wish me luck, I guess.\n\nUPDATE: I’m officially single. For those concerned, he was civil throughout. He didn’t beg, though he did calmly vent some of his own frustrations - namely that he hasn’t felt able to communicate to *me* because of my own reactions prior to being diagnosed bipolar (I was suicidal then). I said that was justified and let him get it all out, on opposite sides of the room. He said he still loves me but can see that I don’t feel the same any more. He clearly wanted to be angry but he held it back. To give him and I space, I’m staying with a friend tonight. I’ll probably do the same for the rest of the week, as this is hitting me harder than I thought - I was prepared for hostility, not civility. Thank you all for the support, it’s been wonderful to read while I recover. Thank you so much. ♥️",

Just has he had been doing the entire appointment, the doctor looks at me and asks a series of progressively infuriating questions:\n\nIs this something you found out about last week? (??????WTF.

He leaves the room to give me time to get ready for the exam and when he comes back in he says, “at your very aggressively firm insistence, I made a note”. Bruh. Go fuck yourself.",

    "text": "A happy rant about being respected as a rape survivor by hospital personnel. I just wanted to share an experience I never thought I’d have. I’m currently in the hospital after having a stroke. When I was first admitted, I somehow managed to keep my jeans on (usually they’re the first things to go once I’m in a gown). It wasn’t until I got up to my room (instead of in the ER) that I was told to take off my pants to prepare for an MRI. \n\nI’ve never been good about speaking up for myself or my needs. Actually, I can’t remember the last time I told a doctor or nurse exactly what I needed or why. But this time, I took a breath, avoided eye contact, and half whispered, half slurred, “Would it be possible to borrow a pair of scrub pants? I’m a rape survivor. I don’t like not having pants on, especially when people I don’t know are going to touch me.”\n\nGuys. This man nodded solemnly, said he was sorry for what I went through and that it wouldn’t be a problem to find me some pants, and then he left. No questions. No weird stares or awkward silence.\n\nBut there’s more. All I mentioned was wanting pants. I said nothing about being weary of male employees or of my personal space being violated. I didn’t ask for anything to be notated or anything like that. But when my night nurse came in, she asked before she touched me in order to check my IV. She said, “I’ve been made aware of your history, and I’m so sorry for what you went through. I’ll be honest- I don’t know how to help. I know what you’re going through right now is scary enough without your history added to it, and I don’t want to do anything to make you feel uncomfortable. So we can learn together. You tell me what you need, and I’ll make it happen.” I was a little stunned. I hope I didn’t come off as ungrateful, because I’m pretty sure I didn’t say a word. \n\nThen the next morning, a woman knocked on my door and there was a man standing a good distance behind her. She introduced herself as a physical therapist and explained that the gentleman behind her was a therapist as well. Y’all, she asked me if it was okay for him to come into the room. And for the entire evaluation/session, she was the one that supported me as I tried to walk or whatever. He stood back and made suggestions. \n\nAnd then tonight, 5 days later, a male tech came in to check my vitals. Half way through, he looked at my name and went a little wide eyed. He apologized. Apparently he swapped with a female tech so that I’d be more comfortable, but he forgot since this entire hallway was his except for me. \n\nIs this was respect feels like? Anytime I’ve ever asked for a female doctor or nurse when I’ve been assigned a male instead, I get that look. The “why aren’t you over it” look or the “stop being so dramatic” stare. \n\nI can’t sleep at night because A. I already have insomnia and B. I can’t seem to calm down enough to trust going to sleep not knowing who is going to come into my room. So what did they do? My nurse moved her station to do her charting next to my open door. She promised not to let anyone in unless she woke me up first.   I’ve come to trust her the last few days, and she knows that. So she’s purposefully putting herself somewhere that makes life more inconvenient for her to make me feel more safe. \n\nThis all feels like a dream. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t recommend having a stroke. The right side of my body would definitely argue against having another one haha.  But I’m just completely astounded that I’ve been respected as a human being and as a survivor so freaking much throughout this admission. I’d say that I hope we get to a place as a society where this type of treatment is the expected norm, but right now I’m just too amazed to find any negativity in it. Thanks for listening to my rant. \n\nWell. Anyway. Considering it’s 3:44am and I can’t sleep, any one want to share similar stories?\n\n\nEdit: Hey guys! This blew up way more than I expected. Quite a few of you mentioned that I should let the hospital know how great their staff is. I definitely intend to! I actually used to work for the hospital I was admitted to (though it’s been 2 years, was in a different department, and a lot has changed there), so I know who to contact where it’ll be seen right away vs. going the survey route. I also plan to nominate them for the awards mentioned in the comments. Thanks for the idea!\n\nAs far as the name of the hospital goes, please message me for the information. I’m not comfortable posting it here as it could be used to find my location. \n\nAnd lastly, thanks for all the well wishes! I was discharged this evening with some sexy new walking aids, a fancy loop recorder in my chest to monitor and record my heart rhythm, and an appointment on Monday to start outpatient rehabilitation services. Over all, I’m doing okay. It still feels weird to know I had a stroke at 29, but what can I say... I’ve always been an overachiever lol.",

    "text": "My uncle wrote an entire book defending a convicted rapist and it is horrifying. I just need somewhere to vent. My uncle has been working on this book for 5 years and self-published it recently. He sent Christmas cards out that urged his family and friends to read the book. So I did. \n\nThe entire book is conjecture. The man was found guilty of the rape by a jury and there is video evidence of him confessing. He failed a polygraph. My uncle has know the rapist since middle school and the rapist was his eye doctor as an adult. The rapist was found guilty of raping his mother in law, and the rapist’s children often came to school looking beaten up (reported by teachers). He defends the rapist stating, “he is a good man and I know he wouldn’t do this.” He has no evidence whatsoever. \n\nSome highlights from the book include:\n\n“One of the tragedies of the American justice system that has come to light since the advent of DNA testing is the number of men falsely convicted of rape on the basis of the victim’s eyewitness testimony.”\n\n“How could a woman emerging from a deep sleep and awakening to the shock of her son-in-law raping her have such a vivid memory of the scene?”\n\nParaphrasing- The mother in law waited a year to report the rape. The mother in law saw her rapist 4 times that year before she reported it. Therefore, she is lying about the rape itself because no one would continue seeing their rapist. \n\n“No one rapes their mother in law”\n\n“Men, when was the last time you entertained thoughts of carnal nature involving your wife’s mother?”\n\nThe whole thing is...horrifying to say the least. That my uncle would spend 5 years of his life writing such a book. That this is so important to him. Every time I think our country is making progress, I’m reminded of how terrible people are. ( I understand polygraphs aren’t reliable and there are forced confessions. I totally get how flawed our legal system is. I’m more commenting on how my uncle has poured such much time and energy defending this acquaintance of his, who has been found guilty, rather than feeling compassion for the victim). \n\nBELIEVE RAPE VICTIMS.",

    "text": "Goodbye I remember taking handover from a colleague a few years ago as I was starting the night shift. The patient was an elderly man in one of our resuscitation rooms. He’d choked on a piece of bread while sat with his family for dinner, and had a hypoxic cardiac arrest following this. It took some time for paramedics to arrive and get ROSC, but he then had a number of further cardiac arrests en route to the emergency department, where he then had one more. He was maxed out on epinephrine and norepinephrine and still had a blood pressure of 50/20. GCS was a flat 3 on zero sedation, and his oxygenation was also terrible despite being intubated. He was accepted to geriatrics for palliation but ICU did not want to accept him as there was no expectation at all of a meaningful recovery and they wanted to save the bed for someone who'd benefit from the resources ICU provides. So this was the last patient in my handover and the first task of my night.\n\nThis particular department is a tertiary center that receives trauma. With all of our resuscitation rooms full, we had nowhere to accept the next trauma patient to and nowhere to see the next septic patient to come through the doors. I spent the first few hours of my shift having multiple conversations with the family about their relative's clinical state and tried to explain that the blood pressure was being supported by medication but still too low to allow for adequate oxygenation, urine output, or any chance of neurological recovery. They were aware that our plan was to allow a natural death and that the ventilator and the vasopressors were only prolonging this, but they were desperate to keep everything going as it was for as long as possible. My goal was to try to get them to understand that supporting his physiology was futile and that allowing him to die would be more dignified.\n\nDuring one of these conversations away from the bedside, we were alerted to the fact that his end-tidal CO2 had dropped off. There was no respiratory effort and his blood pressure had become unrecordable. At this point, I said quite firmly that I was turning the ventilator off as it was no longer doing the job that we were using it for.\n\nFast forward a few years. Three months ago, my mother suffered a sizeable stroke that was amenable to clot retrieval, but this was followed by a large subarachnoid hemorrhage and then another shower of clots. She was comatose for a few days and, when I arrived to her bedside (having to fly from the other side of the world, which in itself was a challenge) she was tolerating a nasopharyngeal airway and barely opening her eyes. She got better from this and over the next couple of weeks was breathing fine again. She was looking around, able to move her head and able to move her left upper limb around. She was reaching out for me and stroking my face. She was able to scratch her itches when she needed to and was playing around with the bedside phone. She held my hand when I sat with her.\n\nNow let's recap the last 30 years. My mother had many health issues over the course of her life, and had breast cancer shortly after I was born. She didn't deal well with being a single mother undergoing breast cancer treatment and so I spent a lot of time with my aunts. She didn't deal very well with being a single mother after her breast cancer treatment either, and the home situation was often very tense. We grew up dirt poor and on welfare. Social services ended up getting involved when I was 6 and I was on their child protection register. She said bad things to the family that alienated me, was often absent emotionally and sometimes physically, and eventually kicked me out when I turned 16, a few years after I stopped going to school. I haven't really talked to her properly over the second half of my life and haven't spoken to her at all in the last three, but I thought about her every day and always wished that things were better.\n\nNow back to present day. Despite reaching this level of consciousness, she is now bedbound and unable to communicate, and this is a woman who previously valued her independence so much that she didn't want to accept any help from her own son despite being burdened with a number of chronic illnesses that limited her mobility and caused her significant pain on a daily basis. Her house is a mess and I had made many offers to help her clean, de-clutter, buy new furniture and a fresh coat of paint. But she always said no, and being asked always angered her.\n\nReading through her diaries, I can see now that she's been miserable for the longest time, even before I was born, feeling like a failure in life because she was so restricted by her health conditions. And yet, knowing this, I still wanted to do everything possible to keep her alive for as long as possible - even though I knew that this wasn't a life she would have ever wanted for herself. Her admission has been horrible, complicated by blood clots in the upper limbs that have caused ischemic changes of the hands and forearms. I've advocated on every occasion for antibiotics, anti-coagulation, consults with surgeons and interventional radiologists, and central venous access to allow these interventions to continue, and I have pushed to continue even when we thought she was close to certain death on fie or six occasions. There was never an expectation, particularly with the extent of brain injury, that she would have a life that was anything like the life she had before, but if she was in a care facility somewhere then I could visit every few months and she'd still be alive. That was enough for me - but not really fair for her.\n\nI received a call over the weekend saying that I needed to come in. She'd had multiple episodes of hematochezia which precludes the use of any further anti-coagulation, and a subsequent NSTEMI. Her renal function has suffered and I've not seen her move any of her limbs in the last week; she's probably had another stroke with the anemia. I've not left the ward since then.\n\nI've seen the progression from comatose to awake-ish and still tracking objects to crying in pain from the blistering on her hands (the first time I really felt she was back in the room - and the first time I was hopeful she might leave hospital) to now Cheyne-Stoke breathing over the last day and a half. I've cried on her arm so much over the last few days because I regret not having a better relationship with her and I wish so much that I'd given her an opportunity to get to know her son a bit better.\n\nOn Saturday, I wanted her to receive a blood transfusion after her three episodes of hematochezia.\n\nOn Sunday, I wanted her to have a second set of blood tests to see if she'd had a type 2 MI.\n\nOn Monday, the team quite frankly said that the only option now was palliation. But she still had her eyes open and was still looking around, and it still felt wrong. They tried to have a conversation with me about the fact that her kidneys aren't being properly perfused and that she's not expected to make a meaningful neurological recovery, but I still wanted another set of blood tests.\n\nOn Tuesday, I sat and talked. I told her about all the holidays I wanted to take her on, and that I wanted to fly her to Sydney to see where I've set up home. I told her about all the fridge magnets I'd bought for her on my travels, that I'd been saving up to bring home to her one day. I told her about all the birthday and Christmas presents I'd bought for her but never had an opportunity to give her. I told her that I love her and that I'm proud of her for powering on every single day of her life in spite of obvious pain and disability, and in spite of her less obvious internal struggles.\n\nOn Wednesday, I finally allowed the first dose of morphine to be given. I was so scared to commit to it because that first dose means that we're committed to this. But the nasogastric feeds continue because I don't want her to become dehydrated, and she's still receiving some of her regular medications because I don't want her last few days to be worsened by a flare of her auto-immune conditions.\n\nI'm a doctor. I know better than anyone else in my family what her prognosis has been. I know that this isn't a quality of life that she would have wanted for herself and I've been secretly wishing for the last few months that something would take her away and that it would be swift - because then the decision is taken out of my hands and I don't have to be the one to start her on that final path. But every time she became febrile or tachycardic, I pushed for fluids and antibiotics because I wasn't ready to say goodbye. And I thought back to the family I'd had these same conversations with a few years ago while sat with my mother today. And it all suddenly made sense. His wife was a doctor but she wanted the ventilator, the pressors, the monitoring, the central line, and the ICU admission. She wasn't ready to say goodbye, even when faced with clear evidence that he was never coming back to her.\n\nNo matter how logical it may seem to you as the healthcare provider and no matter how logical it may seem to me as the relative with a medical degree, saying goodbye is still painfully impossible to do. I've accepted now that she may die today or tomorrow, but I still haven't agreed to withdrawing all treatments because I can't. I wish I could tell that family that I get it now and apologise for only seeing their situation through the eyes of the clinician. Next time I have that conversation with someone, I'll be more patient. I'll be more understanding. I'll walk away if they say no and I'll let them have as much time as they need. I've always known how my mother will go but I've needed three months and it's taken significant complications, a lot of time, and hard evidence in the form of lab results to finally start being able to accept that I need to let her go.\n\nBe kind.",

    "text": "The AMS Consult *No spoilers, but this felt relevant, given today's other posts. Names, details, etc. changed for privacy and because I'm not a total jerk.*\n\n*Apologies, this got a bit long. Please still read it.*\n\n-------\n\nWhen I LARP as a neurohospitalist, things tend to come in waves. Not precisely the same things, mind you. The fine details are endlessly, fractally variable - but the broader brush strokes, much less so. If I see two cardioembolic stroke patients in a day, I can be sure that another five are waiting or actively infarcting in the emergency room. I diagnosed three new cases glioblastoma multiforme (1) in three days. Strangely enough, they all came in between 12-2pm on consecutive days, as if by USPS. A year ago, I diagnosed three new cases of HSV encephalitis in much the same fashion; in proper public health fashion, I confirmed that they all lived distantly from one another, and shared no friends, prostitutes, or toilet seats. \n\n\nNo week is more challenging, however, than the week in which you receive a pallet-full of altered mental status consults. I should take a moment here to point out that that this isn't the kind of challenging you went into medicine for - there's no wiping sweat off your brow, pouring fluids into beakers, or examining blood samples under microscopes till the early morning. You never get to stare up through the ceiling and directly into the eyes of the Almighty, announce that it isn’t this old bitch's time yet, and then - remaining sterile, of course - jam a needle into their living heart with both hands. \n\n\nRather, it's challenging because, in most cases, the obvious things have been done and there isn't much left to offer. There's very rarely an exciting or sexy diagnostic consideration left on the table (2). It only remains to be accepted that, after a certain amount of labs and imaging, obtunded patients will stay obtunded and worried families will stay worried. The patients that generally merit the dreaded “AMS” neuro consult are ill, and often have been for quite some time. Quite a few of these patients have also been alive long to have had lots of other conditions crop up and become chronic - so their medical burden is typically high, even prior to this most recent admission for pooping out a kidney or what have you. To add insult to injury, their labs have only recently become non-catastrophic. \n\n\nNot to be glib, but it's pretty rare that an MRI ordered by neurology will lead to the patient sitting up and starting a nuanced discussion of the Fed's interest rate policy - even if we do it with contrast. \n\n\nIn placing this consult, typically one of two tacit questions are posed to the neurologist:  \"well, the  kidney that's still inside them works, so what the hell?\" or \"We told the patient's family you'd make their brain work again.\"\n\n\nUnfortunately, I never did learn how to make a brain perk up and just start doing better. I try to relay this as kindly and early as I can. I think most of the doctors or families that request my consultation are left with the question \"Well, then what's the point of you?\" It's a good question.\n\n\nI find that the most useful thing I can do is to first make sure that nobody is trying to do a lumbar puncture without any idea of what they're looking for (3), and then take an accurate history. Almost as a rule, somebody else has already taken a stab at it, and reports to me that this frail creature who likely predates the cotton gin is \"usually really sharp.\" This almost always turns out to be the optimistic view of a family whose love allows them to look past things like: falling for repeated Nigerian prince scams; occasionally drifting across the double yellow line, or through a Costco while driving; trouble staying awake for more than 6 hours a day, ever since they saw an interacial couple on television and had their first heart attack.\n\n\nI'm being cynical, of course, and unfair in a few different directions. Not all consults are like that. Not all of these patients are elderly, or chronically confused, or easily explained away by the acute issues that brought them to the hospital in the first place. That's probably the worst part of the altered mental status consult - the knowledge that as soon as you get too jaded or dismissive, the hospital will give you something weird or complex to screw up.\n\n\nWhen the consult popped up on my phone, I could feel my blood pressure spike, just a little. For some reason, pages sent by nurses in our system always appear in caps, which grants a sense of urgency that is often unfair (4). As I read through the chart, things didn't get much better. Sure, the patient was in his 50's, but he was ill! He'd been admitted for covid a few weeks ago, and it didn't appear that a single end organ had escaped unscathed. Lots of his lab values had little red flags next to them, and I was already developing the bitter smugness that makes everyone cherish specialists so much. To top it all off, the notes made mention that the patient's *wife* was the one that thought he was confused! Did the hospitalist themselves even have a question for me?\n\n\nI've been surprised in the past, and so of course I went to see the patient - but don't imagine that I didn't do it without a lot of grumbling and quiet drama. I may have leaned my head back against a wall and sighed a few times. If there had been a rock or empty can in the hallway, I'd have given it a doleful kick (5). I donned my PPE with the pique of a high schooler that shows up for detention, but, like, doesn't even *care* about it because it's just so *arbitrary*. \n\n\nWhen I entered the room, I encountered a man of about middle age, with receding hair that flourished into a mullet, steely blue eyes, and a beard that plunged gracefully down his neck and into his chest hair without the faintest hesitation. He had huge, undefined arms, and the kind of belly that doesn't protrude necessarily, but bulges anyway due to omental abundance and organ huskiness. If we were in a drinking contest, he seemed to be the type that could lift a keg over his head and finish it with a laugh before I was halfway into my first rosé.\n\n\n\"Help you?\" he asked me with a lift of his eyebrows. I don't run into this greeting much in the hospital, and it charms me every time. The scrubs & coat costume I throw on usually signifies that I'm the one providing help, or at least pantomiming it while doing reflexes. So when patients offer, even as a figure of speech, it just feels nice.\n\n\nI introduced myself, gave my usual wave, etc. I asked him some incisive questions about his location, the date, why he was in the hospital. He replied - respectively - with:\n\n\n1) \"A shitbox hospital with half decent food.\"\n\n2) \"You're the fourth guy to ask me that today. It's _______. Feel like I oughta be testing you people.\"\n\n3) \"Fuckin' covid.\"\n\n\nThis wasn't how they speak to one another at Buckingham Palace, but he was hardly wrong. To tell the truth, I was having trouble actually detecting any confusion. I decided to earn my paycheck and ask about some semantics.\n\n\n\"If you would, explain this phrase to me: 'The grass is always greener on the other side.' \"\n\n\nI looked at him expectantly, and he returned the favor for a long moment, before finally asking \"The grass?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, as in a lawn or something.\"\n\n\n\"Kid, I don't give a shit about grass.\"\n\n\n\"Well, sure.\" I said. \"But I'm more trying to see if you can explain the idea.\"\n\n\n\"Well, I'm not a goddamn gardener. How about that idea?\"\n\n\n\"No, no, I get it. You're not growing heirloom tomatoes,\" I agreed. I was holding my hands up, as if in surrender, but I continued to press him, as some deep part of me had apparently decided that this was the hill I would die on. \"But maybe there's something in that yard that you do like.\"\n\n\n\"Like a woman?\" he asked.\n\n\n\"A what?\" Masks can cover many things, and are one of our best chances at curbing the spread of covid19 - but they do nothing for the squeak of a neurologist's voice as they completely lose control of the interview. \n\n\nHe repeated himself, and I stared for a long while, picking my way through an ethical minefield before finally settling on a lame \"Sure, I guess.\"\n\n\nAt this, he fixed me with a piercing look, cocking his head a little as he read deeply - and incorrectly - into my history and character. Then, in a much gentler tone: \"Kid, let me tell you something my daddy told me, ok? Dance with the girl you brung. It's that simple. Don't go looking around.\"\n\n\n\"No, no, not me,\" I prostest. \"I said *grass*, you’re the one that -“ but he cut me off.\n\n\n\"Don't get divorced, kid. You'll regret it if you do,\" he said, with the compassion of a man that had made mistakes, lived through them, and cared enough to pass those lessons along.\n\n\n\"...I won't,\" I promised, in the voice of a hesitant, scrawnier man who hadn't planned to make any mistakes in the first place. At this point, it was clear I had to change things up a little. Mentally setting my jaw and yanking my scrubs up to my nipples, I decided to be direct. \"Look, do you feel like yourself? Or have you been feeling a bit foggy?\"\n\n\n\"Foggy *how*?\" he asked, suspiciously.\n\n\n\"You see, they called me because there was some concern that you were confused,\" I told him. “But you don't seem terribly confused to me, so I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing in here, and how I can be helpful.\"\n\n\nWith that, his eyes narrowed. With a sort of icy calm, he asked me who exactly had said he was confused. I told him that the hospitalist had been “a little concerned,” and there was some mention that his wife “had been concerned as well.” This was, in fact, the most cowardly way I could have put things, and I didn’t do so by accident. Alarm bells were ringing in my head, and if I’d thought speaking in a Little Annie voice would have helped, I’d have done it in a second. Pride goeth and all that.\n\n\nAs it turned out, my fight or flight response had been dead on. When I mentioned his wife, I could feel the temperature in the room drop by at least 10 degrees. He flushed a deep red. The cords on his forearms stood out, and for a moment, it seemed as though the lights dimmed a little. Though he’d hardly moved a muscle, the inappropriate tenderness of a few moments ago was gone. Suddenly, he was fraught with power; a Talladegan Hephaestus who might lay me across his anvil in a rage if I didn’t watch what I said next. Underneath the hum of the jury-rigged HVAC, I swore I could hear the rumble of plates shifting beneath our feet, and the shriek of ball lightning.\n\n\n“*I see*,” he finally said, and his tone was measured. Since I wasn’t entirely sure of what it was he did see, I kept my mouth shut - but I was certain it wasn’t the sort of thing I’d be able to lay to bed with an MRI and some gabapentin.\n\n\n“This again,” he continued, his face beginning to twist with rage. “This shit just *does not end*.” He paused between these last words, giving each their own emphasis, before meeting my gaze with a look that both threatened and begged understanding. “Look, not going to college don't make a man confused.\"\n\n\n“No, obviously not. I mean, Justin Bieber right?”\n\n\n*Immediately*, a wave of regret washed over me. In both my head and my heart, I’d truly meant to say “Bill Gates.” But there appears to be some mechanism, some sort of infernal collapsible circuit just south of Broca’s region, which was built solely with the purpose of making me look like a shit head (6).\n\n\nSensibly enough, he ignored me. “Having a few hobbies don't fuckin' make him confused either.\" His voice was getting louder now. “But any time I don't do something her way don't make me confused!\"\n\n\nIf you’d diagrammed this last sentence, it would have looked like a spiral - but I took it in the spirit in which it was shouted. Cooler heads needed to prevail. \n\n\"I understand that, sir, but I think we need to calm down a little,\" I said. It was probably close to the right thing to say - but consider that I was also wearing foggy goggles, purple latex gloves, and a big blue trash bag that I'd cinched around my hips and shoulders. To my own dull horror, I further realized that, at some point,  I had hunched my shoulders and laced my fingers across my belly (7). Whatever was happening here had years of marital discord behind it. That kind of momentum simply does not get derailed by fancy little gentlemen in DIY Veruca Salt drag.\n\n\n“I know what this is about!” These last words appeared to tear something deep inside of him on their way out; his face wore the faraway tragic expression of a veteran that cannot forget. Then, in a desperate half-whisper: “I left the dog in Charlotte on purpose!”\n\n\n\"Oh, shit,\" said someone that sounded an awful lot like me.\n\n\n“We was in Charlotte in June and we took the goddamn dog with us. Well, when we got ready to come back, I told the dog get in the truck. It never listened, and I just decided, you know, fuck it. That dog never liked me. So I figured I’d just kinda… see what happened.”\n\n\nI stared at him.\n\n\n“So, like, we start driving. Truck’s pretty full, but she didn’t even notice he weren’t there. So I keep driving. I guess after a while it was kind of quiet and suddenly Carol just screams out ‘*Brantley*!’ Nearly drove off the fuckin' road.”\n\n\nI almost staggered at this latest revelation. They’d named the dog “Brantley.” Even dog murder paled in comparison.\n\n\n“She couldn’t believe we’d forgotten him. I mean, *I* could,” he said with a sort of shrug. “But I just kind of played along, you know? Acted surprised and all. I told her it was too far to turn around anyway - it was, like, two hours.” He paused for a second, as if realizing something for the first time. “Two whole hours,” he repeated, more indignantly. “And she says I’m confused?” \n\n\n“Look, I have to stop you here, sir. I’m not sure I can be helpful with a lot of this. I know I can’t, in fact,” I started, trying to build up an exit strategy. But he’d obviously stumbled onto a new line of reasoning here, and he was going to explore it to the fullest.\n\n\n“Maybe she’s the one that’s confused,” he suggested. “Maybe you oughta be having this conversation with *her*.”\n\n\n“No, I should not,” I said, essentially out of tricks.\n\n\nBut, in keeping with our entire conversation to day, he simply ignored me and reached for his phone. I placed my hand over his without thinking and his eyes snapped up to mine. I suddenly felt like a zookeeper that’s forgotten to give the resident hippo a warning pat before it’s nightly suppository. But I held my ground this time, reasoning that no matter the outcome - abrupt violence or continuing this interview with his wife added to the mix - I was going to die in this room. The only way out was through.\n\n\n“Just let me examine you, ok? If everything looks ok, then I’ll leave you alone. If not, then we’ll figure it out together. Just bear with me.”\n\n\nAfter a few moments of reflection, he decided to leave my skeleton inside of my skin, and we got started. It was almost a relief to start getting some objective data, after the swamp of emotional volatility we’d just waded through together. I was certain that after a few cranial nerves, pushes, pulls and taps to muscle bellies, our relationship would reach its natural conclusion. \n\n\nCertainty is generally idiotic, especially when you’re me, and double especially when you’re in the hospital. I showed very little promise as a neuro-ophthalmologist during residency, and so when I watched his eye movements, the words that popped into my head were “janky AF eye twerking;\" the more sober and literate among us would describe these findings as “gaze evoked multidirectional nystagmus, oculomotor apraxia, and likely saccadic intrusions.”\n\n\nHis motor exam revealed similar spontaneous oddities and incoordination. On activation - i.e. when he wasn’t lying still or clutching bed sheets in a sort of righteous fury - his movements were decidedly weird. I either hadn’t noticed before, or I’d written it off as agitation and fidgetiness. But it was in fact a tendency towards choreoathetosis which he was able to transiently suppress. \n\n\nTo get to the punchline, I’ll simply tell you that his sensory exam was fine, and his reflexes were pathologic. His MRI showed malevolent-looking, diffuse T2 FLAIR changes throughout most of the cerebral subcortical regions - including all of the gray matter you don't want to see involved. There were patches of roughly correlating DWI changes, tiny GRE blooms throughout with a particular affinity for the bilateral caudate heads, and no enhancing lesions. \n\n\nHis wife was a story unto herself, and it was a phone interview for the ages. There was a lot of material to get through regarding their marriage, their kids, her mother's loveless marriage, etc. But honestly, at this point, I simply had to know. I would have interviewed Brantley if I’d had to.\n\n\nFeelings and matrimonial history aside, I learned that he worked in a machine shop. I also learned that he did in fact have some hobbies, which included amateur metallurgy and electroplating. He’d started recently, and enjoyed it very much. “Amateur,” in this context meant that he’d assembled a shed behind his house, where he kept: plastic tubs full of chemicals; some car batteries; ladles; a leather apron; some old gold jewelry, in a gunsafe he’d welded to a bunch of weights. Things he had not invested in included: face or eye protection; lids for the tubs; a fan of some kind. \n\n\nI asked about some of the chemicals he used. At various times they'd included nickel, silver, gold, and cyanide. I did confirm this last one. \n\n\n*Mystery solved*, I thought. That’s it. Toxicity from exposure to aerosolized cyanide and God knows what else, yielding neuropsychiatric changes including (but not limited to) atypical eye movements, choreoathetosis, and irrational hatred of what I imagined to be a golden doodle. It made sense. It felt right. There was still plenty of work to be done, and I doubted I could entirely defer a lumbar puncture in good conscience - but it seemed as though I'd finally be able to put a bow on this particular psychodrama, and move on with my life. I started to wonder if this wasn't what Free Willy had felt like, as he leapt over the rock wall, into the sunset, and just over the head of a poorly supervised orphan. \n\n\nAs I started to relax, she dropped the final bomb on me. “Of course, he lost our *first* dog about a year ago.”\n\n\nBelieve it or not, he did have CJD. He had been acting oddly for some time now, and the bizarre, poorly considered metallurgy set up in the back yard was almost certainly more symptom than cause. I followed him, and watched his decline. His initial EEG didn't show me much, but the follow up study in 3 months showed me those classed periodic sharp wave complexes - it was the first time I'd seen them in the wild, and not my attending's file of interesting EEG snippets. I think I only fully relaxed, though, when the 14-3-3 protein came back positive. I spoke to his wife a lot during this period; I don't know how much she liked me, but since she'd only ever known me during the worst time of her life, and I couldn't blame her. \n\n\nAMS consults, as a rule, are an utter goddamn pain. There's no getting around it. And then, maybe 1% of the time, they're the single wildest ride you can take - and they're precisely what you signed on for.\n\n\n--------------\n\n1) A disease whose sole risk factor, based on my own anecdata, appears to be the possession of a beautiful spirit and/or a lovely family.\n\n2) Though when there is, and something interesting shows up in the CSF, I've found within myself a tendency to become a little overconfident. Given enough serotonin, I begin to undo the top 6 buttons of my shirt and slap coffee out of the hands of interns. Surprisingly, I never acted like this back in residency. The mask has been slipping.  \n\n3) this hasn't happened terribly often, but it has happened more often than anyone would like\n\n4) But not always. The single best one I've ever gotten was \"RECTAL NUMBNESS.\" That's it. Aside from the patient's room number, that was the entire page. Also, yes, they did have a cord compression.\n\n5) My shoulders would have been slumped, and it would have been raining, and The Lonely Man would have been playing probably.\n\n6) My theory is that this circuit - if we could only find it - would confirm not only that a higher power exists, but that its possesses an 6 dimensional, extra mean sense of humor.\n\n7) Picture how Patton stood during his famous speech, and then imagine the diametric opposite. Try it right now. I guarantee you that even if they were in another room or state, your significant other just went into a fugue, grabbed their phone, and began to download Tinder.",

    "text": "Are you sure you want us to do everything? Over a year ago, my self-given name of a heart nurse was stripped away by COVID. A few months into the pandemic, I clocked into work one day, pushed the cold, metal plate that opens the door to my unit, and realized that everything has changed. “WARM ZONE” tape covered the door and plastic sheets and masking tape sealed in the openness to the nursing station.\n\nWalking to the desk to find my assignment, a loud buzzing sound muffled the voices of other staff around me. HEPA filters. There is one in every room of the unit. I am handed an N95 mask and told to reuse it until it falls apart. “You are now in a warm zone, so you can’t take it off even when you’re not in a patient’s room.” This thing is so uncomfortable. I texted my husband, “well, we are a COVID unit now,” while planning in my head how I am going to get back into my house tonight without infecting him or my baby girl.\n\nThe coming months in the COVID ICU were harsh. Policy change after policy change came and went trying to keep up with the ever-changing guidelines. While the nursing staff and doctors were expected to maintain excellent standards, everyone else seemed to get special treatment to avoid exposure. Shift after shift, I started to realize that COVID was the worst disease I have ever encountered.\n\nA typical patient that was admitted to our unit with COVID was usually already on their last leg. Intubating was always a last resort. We would keep them on a facemask for weeks at a time. Pre-COVID, patients on facemask ventilation were able to take it off briefly for breaks, food, and pills. I had the same experience with every COVID patient on facemask ventilation.\n\nFor example, my sweet man in room 52.\n\nHe looked so tired and today is day 6 of facemask ventilation. I take off his mask to give him is baby aspirin and notice skin breakdown on his nose and cheeks from wearing the mask longer than it was intended for. It looked painful. Seconds later, his lips turn purple and the monitor alarms “SpO2 62%.” It took hours for his oxygen levels to recover. “Well, I am never doing THAT again,” I say to myself in my head. The next day, I come into his room, and he won’t wake up. I page the ICU MD, “time to intubate,” “ok, get everything ready,” he says. I grab the intubation kit, sedative medications, and call his family. “Are you sure you want us to do this?” I ask his wife. In hindsight, that must have sounded nuts – of course do everything you can to save him! But it seems like such an obvious question to those who have been in my shoes.\n\nShe wants everything done, so I grab the crash cart too – just in case. We intubate him, and like the last 100 COVID patients that we intubate, it goes really poorly. His oxygen drops so low that I am already thanking myself for bringing the crash cart. I grab my team – “we have to prone him or he is going to code and die.” They know exactly what I mean because they too have had the same experience with their COVID patients. “Ugh, his wife wants everything done?” my coworker asks me. “Yes” I reply as I roll my eyes. My resentment toward his wife is clearly misplaced, but he isn’t the only unstable COVID patient on our unit. We have now seen months and months of grieving families. I have told countless husbands, wives, daughters, and sons that they need to come say goodbye to their loved one after weeks of ICU care. “Why is this happening?” is always the question. I wish I knew. I’ve given and received a lot of teary-eyed hugs through isolation gowns and N95 masks.\n\nMy patient we intubated that day was on the ventilator for weeks suffering from skin breakdown and lung fibrosis because of COVID pneumonia. I let his wife facetime him every time I took care of him, and I could never listen to her words of love she had for him because I knew what the outcome was going to be. I was right.\n\nGo down the north hall to the basement, go through 2 sets of doors, make a right and you’ll meet security there. That’s where the morgue is. There were months when I went there every single shift.\n\nThe hardest part was the torture. It seems like a harsh word, but that’s what COVID patients in the ICU experience.  Torture. We all know before they are ever intubated that they are going to die, but we intubate them, put in lines, tubes, flip them on their belly, refuse to allow them to see their family, and code them until they die – alone. That’s why I felt so resentful toward my patient’s wife. She could have had the opportunity to come hold his hand and say goodbye – those were the only times the hospital allowed visitors – end of life. I still am not sure who or what I am angry at – hospital administration, the government, angry families, or Wuhan, China.  \n\nAcross the US, the patient burden skyrocketed while nurses retired early, left the bedside, and took travel assignments to make more money. Our unit felt the brunt of it all. Most of my unit family is gone now – COVID took that away from me too. These are the only people that truly understand what I have been through. If you ever become a patient in a COVID ICU – your nurse is your lifeline. It’s important that your nurse is not chronically overwhelmed by the pressures of the unit.\n\nAt first, I was so angry. Then, I cried a lot and mourned my patients in private. I took a lot of my anger and sadness out on my family. Now, I feel like my heart is as hard as a rock. COVID cases have fallen significantly, but I have changed. I, too, am leaving the bedside.\n\nAmerica, take care of your nurses.",

    "text": "my first palliative case with an awake, oriented and fully cognitive patient. I'm sure lots of people here have had a version of this story happen countless times in their career. But this was my first time, so i thought i'd write it.\n\nAs a little forward, i've seen some 20 cases of palliative patients, they were all either congnitively absent, or so sick they lost contact with the our world.  Some were bound to die soon anyway and we just didn't want to torture them for a couple of weeks longer than they needed to.\n\n2 days ago it was very different. I received an 83 year old man with COPD since 30 years. He already had Lung cancer and Cor Pulmonale with the usual list of diseases for his age. he didn't use his machine at home for the last few days, built up some CO2, was somnolent, so his family sent him to us. His pCO2 was 120 at admission. He had the typical skin of longterm cortison therapy, mixed with the bruises of taking anticoagulants. If you look at his skin wrong it'll bleed. \n\nWe got him on the Bipap machine, underwhich he was doing better, but after 3 days he still couldn't get off of the machine without building up CO2 to 80+ in a short time, and then desatting once he's somnolent again.\n\nAfter those 3 days i wanted to call the family, let them come to talk about the therapy with them. he was already declared DNR/DNI, but we still needed to set a plan. I started by saying that I, as a Doctor and a person, would never want to live in a state where my existence long-term relies on a machine, that i'd never want to be what germans call a \"Pflegefall\" aka \"Nursing-case\" (meaning heavily reliant on care from other people). We already know he's DNR/DNI, but we need further planning in case he never gets off the machine.\n\nThey tell me he also never wanted to be a \"nursing case\", i told them to go talk to him as a family, after some time i'd go there and talk to them. In such cases i always try to tell the family that they are not making the decision (because its too much to ask from them imo), i tell them they are helping US make the decision that would be best for the patient. i feel this takes the edge off.\n\nafter some time, i call on the family, and we go to a seperate room. they tell me they all agreed, they want to turn the Bipap off.\n\ntbh that took me by surprise. I didn't expect that they'd want to do that now. I asked them if they knew what implication that has. they said he'd die. they explained that his visits to the hospital are more frequent, time between hospital visits is shorter, and his in-Patient time is longer. At home he also couldn't be off the machine for a long time. so he flat out refused it for the last few days.\n\nI told them i'll have to discuss this with my consultant, but if everything goes as planned, i'll fullfill his wish, and make sure he is as comfortable as possible. they asked me how it will go once i turn the machine off, which is a question i received often now. I explain that without the machine he'll find it harder to breathe, but we'll manage his distress with morphin, and make sure he is as comfortable as possible. At some point he will sleep, and then just... go. I also explained that it would all happen relatively quickly.\n\nAnd then i sent them on their way, and went to talk with the patient himself. he was still under the BIPAP, he was awake, and oriented. his skin was leaking serous fluid at this point.\n\nHis name is COPD Patient, but we've grown close in the last few days so i like to just call him COPD.\n\n- COPD, did you just talk with your family?\n\n Nods yes\n\n- did you all agree on a decision?\n\n Nods yes\n\n- Do you want this BIPAP machine?\n\n Nods no\n\n- Do you know what would happen if we took you off the machine?\n\n Motions his own beheading with his hand\n\n- and you want us to do this?\n\n Nods yes\n\n- alright. we'll make sure you're as comfortable as possible in the mean time. we'll take care of it.\n\nSo i call my consultant, i explained the situation briefly, and she said \"Do it\". I asked if there is any procedure i should follow? if there is anything else to it but just literally going there and turning the machine off. She said no, Document everything in the chart, then go and turn the machine off. which felt a bit too.. underwhelming? for such a case and such an action on an awake patient.\n\nI've seen many palliatives, but this was the first time in my life that an awake person, with all his mental and cognitive capacity, without being septic or on 3 different pressors with an infaust prognosis, tells me they want to die.\n\nI turned the machine off, give him a morphin perfusor, and slowly escalated it. Without the machine he could be heard again, so he told me, taking breaks between sentences:\n\n\"I've battled this fucking disease.... for 30 years, now... now its enough\"\n\nAt the very end of my shift, while still under morphine, he asked me for an Oxygen mask.\n\nEven though its against procedure i gave him the mask, i didn't find it in me to tell him \"no..too late! you die without oxygen\". so i put him on a little bit of oxygen and then go home.\n\nHe survived the 12 Hours till the start of my next shift, and died 1 hour after its beginning. I hope i never experience it again.",

    "text": "Malaria, Mental Illness, & the Perils of Diagnosis  (source: [https://neurocentrix.com.au/blog](https://neurocentrix.com.au/blog)) \n\nDoctors generally view diagnoses as discrete, well-defined entities. You either have malaria, or you do not. You are pregnant, or you are not. There is no in-between. Settling upon one also rules out the others. For example, if a CT on a patient with a splitting headache shows a brain tumour, that’s the diagnosis. The doctors don’t go hunting for other causes such as migraine or haemorrhage. While it’s possible for a patient to have two different causes of the same symptoms, in practice this scenario is so rare that it can safely be ignored. One diagnosis is more than enough.\n\nWhen psychiatry entered the medical fold, it was assumed that the same model would apply. When a patient is diagnosed with say, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder, then that condition would explain their symptoms and guide their treatment. The patient would not have both depression and PTSD, or so the thinking went. Yet statistical analysis of mental health databases shows something entirely different, a finding that brings uncomfortable questions to the heart of psychiatry. Not only do most patients have more than one diagnosis, but each diagnosis makes every other diagnosis more likely. This means that a diagnosis of depression increases your chance of also having PTSD, schizophrenia, anorexia, bipolar … *all of them*. This is most certainly not how diagnosis is supposed to work. \n\nIf the same pattern held for medical illnesses, then diagnosing arthritis would mean you were *more* likely to have tuberculosis or diabetes. Having gallstones would increase the chances of haemophilia or herpes. In fact, having any illness at all would render you more likely to have any of the others! This is precisely the opposite of how medical illnesses behave. When the CAT scan shows that the patient has a brain tumour, the diagnoses of migraine or cluster headaches are certainly not made more likely. They are ruled out. Yes, the patient may have many of the same symptoms, but that doesn’t matter, the diagnosis is brain tumour, end of story. Since the scenario is so preposterous, psychiatrists have begun to wonder what all this overlap means for the nature of mental illness. \n\nThe major difference between medical and psychiatric diagnosis is the handbook of mental illnesses, the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual*, or *DSM*. Whereas a medical illness like pneumonia might be diagnosed by an x-ray and blood test, depression is defined by having a certain number of symptoms from a list in the *DSM*. These include a loss of appetite, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and of course, depressed mood. You can immediately notice that these items on the checklist are broader and less well-defined than seeing a tumour on an x-ray, or a bug under a microscope. *DSM* criteria also have great potential for overlap. Take insomnia, for example, which could be caused by anxiety, depression, mania, psychosis, or something else entirely. \n\nThe only time when having one medical diagnosis makes having another more likely is when there is a clear causal link. For example, a brain tumour may cause a brain haemorrhage. The patient with both is not exceptionally unlucky; receiving two very unlikely diseases at once. He got unlucky with one, and it caused the other. On the medical wards, it is common to see patients with a whole host of diagnoses. A typical medical admission may have diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive airways disease, pneumonia and heart failure. Here the diagnoses are all interlinked, which is why they appear together so frequently. Diabetes leads to ischaemic heart disease, which leads to heart failure. Chronic obstructive airways disease leads to pneumonia, which in turns worsens the heart failure and the diabetes. At the beginning of it all may be smoking. The difference with psychiatry is that each medical illness is a clear category. Diabetes is elevated blood sugar; pneumonia is infected lungs. While they may be related in *cause*, they do not overlap in *category*. \n\nThe confusion in psychiatric diagnoses comes from overlap in both cause *and* category. Diabetes can lead to pneumonia, PTSD can lead to depression – so far so good. But both PTSD and depression can have the same symptoms of social withdrawal, negative thoughts, ruminating about the past, loss of appetite and energy, and many more. Deciding which symptoms are part of which diagnosis is not easy, and to make matters worse, there is no test to decide the issue. A physician can run a blood test or pull up an x-ray and actually see diabetes or pneumonia. Psychiatrists cannot ‘see’ depression. Even with the most advanced brain imaging, which is only used in research, PTSD and depression appear very much the same. \n\nDifferent illnesses sharing the same symptoms partly explains why having one diagnosis increases the chance of having another. Another reason is that there are very few, if any, symptoms that occur in only one mental illness. Most crop up everywhere. The cardinal symptom of schizophrenia, for example, is having auditory hallucinations. But these are also found in depression and mania. They may even appear in someone not mentally ill at all, but suffering from too much stress and not enough sleep. Since no one symptom can define schizophrenia, psychiatrists rely on others such as delusions or paranoia, but these too are found elsewhere. And that’s for schizophrenia, which is probably the most striking and clear-cut psychiatric diagnosis of them all, what Thomas Szasz called, “the sacred symbol of psychiatry”. How to distinguish between depression, dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder? You can perhaps surmise that psychiatric diagnosis is very messy and complex, and wonder how psychiatrists ever decide anything at all. \n\nYet in practice, psychiatrists diagnose illnesses quickly and have little trouble drawing the line between well and unwell. A psychiatrist missing a major mental illness is very rare, at least as rare as a physician missing a major medical illness. While a patient with a clear brain tumour may not notice or show any symptoms for months, depression may be entirely obvious immediately. Similarly, if a man suddenly tears off his clothes at work and declares himself to be the Witch King of Centrelink, there may be disagreement over whether the diagnosis is schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or something else, but there is zero doubt that a diagnosis is warranted.  \n\nWe can summarise these findings as follows: \n\n1) Psychiatric diagnosis is easy in general, hard in specifics.  \n\n2) Distinguishing mental illnesses from normal is easy, hard from each other.\n\nIn other words, mental illnesses are real, but fuzzy. Psychiatrists have long understood this paradox, but until recently there has been little hope of a solution. Now they are turning to the burgeoning field of neuroscience to place psychiatry on a more secure footing. Studying genetics, brain imaging and neural pathways, researchers are slowly illuminating the physical basis of mental illnesses. Particularly striking is the finding that similar genes or brain changes are involved in several different conditions. For example, schizophrenia and autism share similar genetic and structural changes, which is exactly what their overlapping symptoms would predict. \n\nWhat does this tell us about what mental illnesses really are? One theory is that mental illnesses are best understood not as discrete entities but as a variety of overlapping dimensions that emerge from abnormalities in the brain. The nature and severity of these brain changes, and how they combine together, may ultimately explain how illnesses shade into one another. So instead of puzzling over whether a patient claiming to be Witch King of Centrelink has schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, a psychiatrist may diagnose his condition in terms of disturbance in mood, connection between thoughts, and reality perception. Ideally each of these symptom types will relate to a particular neural circuit and an avenue for treatment. For example, the patient may be treated with lithium to stabilise his mood, a benzodiazepine to quell his anxiety, and olanzapine to streamline his disconnected thinking. As our imaging and understanding of the brain improves, there will be a tighter connection between the symptoms observed, the labels applied, and the treatments delivered. Just as occurs right now in physical medicine. \n\nThe reason why this approach is not already mainstream is that neuroscience lags far behind our knowledge of other organs, largely because the brain is vastly more complex. Here lies an irony, since we are fully aware of many of the brain’s operations – such as the choice to reach out for a glass – but how that choice comes about, and what permits us to experience both the choosing and the reaching, is a total mystery. Meanwhile we are unaware of processes of regulating blood pressure and digestion, yet researchers have detailed precisely how they happen. Brain science remains in its infancy, and stuck there with it is psychiatry. \n\nPhysical medicine was only recently in the same position. For centuries, doctors thought that malaria was from something in the air (hence the name, literally “bad air”) but only recently identified its precise relationship to the mosquito and the parasite it carries. Now doctors know the lifecycle of *falciparum malaria,* its effect on various organs, the best drugs to treat it, and the means to prevent it. Before then were treatments, such as quinine, or ‘Jesuit’s Bark’, that were discovered by chance and worked by processes unknown. The brain is so complex that when it comes to its afflictions, we remain at the stage of “bad air” and Jesuit’s Bark. \n\nYet there is reason for hope. Little more than a century ago, there was very little understanding of mental illness and almost no treatment. Since then, a variety of effective treatments have been discovered, and improving neuroscience is helping us understand why they work. As we unravel the brain’s mysterious processes in ever more detail, better treatments will be discovered and not just by the fickle whim of chance. With genetics and imaging, researchers are beginning to design treatments tailored to specific brain circuits. This process goes both ways, as investigating the structures behind successful treatments can illuminate why they work, which then paves the way for even better treatments. Psychiatry is still on the trail of its *falciparum malaria,* but the path is not as dark as it once was.",

    "text": "Tasmanian Devil delivers a breech baby vaginally, and I lived to tell about it. I have to tell you guys this story, cause I can’t even believe it myself.  It's long as fuck.  Cheers.\n\n\n\nFor you in the OB world: tonight my meth-addled patient involuntarily pushed out a frank breech baby under conscious sedation. If none of that makes sense to you, keep reading, dear Redditor: it will.\n\nIn my 16 years as an L&D nurse, this night takes the cake.\n\n\n\nSo, coming on at 7pm it’s a little busy, but we don’t exactly need roller-skates yet…. I get report from Nurse 6th-Shift that there’s a patient coming up from ED. She presented to the ED with abdominal pain two days ago. They took one look at her mental health history (schizophrenia) and apparently decided that everything that came out of her mouth would be lies. She told them she was 37 weeks pregnant. So they did a chest x-ray, and an ultrasound that showed she was 33 weeks pregnant and then discharges her schizophrenic ass to the street.\n\n2 days later, she shows up back in the ED, and in the interim, she’s managed to find enough methamphetamine to blast her into florid mania. My report from 6th-Shift was “well, in the same 3 minutes she told me she is the Queen of Hawaii, an attorney, and that her parents owned the hospital.” Also, that her baby is alive, and that her mania turns into belligerent violence about every 5-7 minutes.\n\n“I told the ED doc that I can’t tell whether she’s in preterm labor or not because she tried to punch me.  I told them she should probably come up to L&amp;amp;amp;D so we can figure it out.” After 2.5 hours of this patient raising holy hell in the ED, they joyfully but slowly bring her up to us.  Excellent call, Nurse 6th-Shift.\n\nSpoiler alert: the patient delivered 2 hours later.\n\nTo my endless delight, the one thing that the ED doc did correctly in this situation was to order 2 mg PO Ativan, and 5mg IM Haldol. Bless his heart, he couldn’t figure out to send her up to L&amp;amp;amp;D for evaluation of her abdominal pain, but he sure as fuck could snow her for us.\n\nGood man.\n\nShe arrives curled up and filthy on a stretcher.  She is somnolent, but cooperative enough that we’re able to herd her onto the labor bed.  Just after the exasperated ED nurse leaves, the patient suddenly becomes very animated. “I gotta PISS!!!!” Writhing in the bed, clutching her belly: she is the very picture of labor. I put a hand on her rock-hard abdomen and my stomach drops to my knees.  At this point, all I know is: she had an ultrasound 2 days ago that put her at 33 weeks. In the 2 minutes since I met her, I am certain: she is going to deliver a preterm baby very soon.   Our one-bed well-baby nursery is woefully unprepared to care for a 33 weeker.\n\n60 seconds later, her contraction ends and she is snoring again (bless that man).  I swallow my moral outrage at checking an unconscious woman’s cervix, and find her to be 4cm dilated.\n\nAnd, fucking breech.\n\n(For those of you outside the OB world: Breech babies are NOT born vaginally. The risk of head entrapment is terrifying: the head is the biggest part of a baby’s body. This can quickly turn into dead baby hanging out of a vagina and that’s not a good look on anyone. So, any baby who is breech is universally born by c-section.)\n\nWhere were we?  Oh yeah: 33 weeks, breech, and psychotic with contractions.\n\nAs I jump up off the bed to start sounding the alarms, I see I now have a handful of meconium.\n\nNot meconium-stained fluid… Frank meconium. From a frank breech baby who is now pooping into its mother’s vagina.\n\nNow the score is up to: meth-induced preterm labor, breech, and meconium. This is the worst hat trick in the OB world. Fuck my life.\n\nSo, we start making plans to ship her out.  We gotta transport this train wreck to a facility that can care for a preterm baby.\n\nI call the community on-call Dr. LaLa to report our hat trick, and after her telling me 8 different ways that we just need to c-section her and ship the baby, I say “well, why don’t you (STOP FUCKING TALKING AND) head in here, and we’ll have some more information when you get here.\n\nIn the background, volume 10: “I GOTTA PISS!!!!” I run back into the room to keep the patient from tearing her IV out as she barrels for the bathroom like a bull with its balls in a pinch. I also discover that she is dribbling copious amounts of undiluted meconium down her legs, has wiped it on the siderail, and has generally made a baby-poo finger painting out of everyone and everything in the room. Pretty sure I have some in my hair.\n\nBy the time Dr. LaLa waltzes in, it is clear to everyone on the unit that not only is this lady not going to stay pregnant long enough to make it to the helicopter, she isn’t going to stay pregnant long enough to make it into surgery. Also, she is almost completely unresponsive in between contractions and definitely cannot consent to surgery. Once Dr. LaLa catches up to speed on the very real mess that we’re all in, she says “Call Dr. Crusty, whatever happens - he can help.”\n\nOh great.   Good old Dr. Crusty. (we’ll get to how he earned that name later.)\n\nDr. Crusty has two states of being:\n\n1. Look up the word “doddering” in the dictionary. His grinning face is the damn centerfold. It would be cute, if he wasn’t a surgeon. He dodders at everything. Walking, dictation, perineal repair, sharp dissection… I’ve seen him lacerate two babies’ faces in c-sections and yet still he is somehow in practice.  The OR techs give him the biggest needles they can find because he can't see the smaller ones.  He has a legit parkinsonian shuffle.  I could go on for days...\n2. His other mode is: \"8 SEMI-CONFLICTING ORDERS AT ONCE! JESUS CHRIST YOU INCOMPETENT NITWITS MOVE FASTER!\" His trauma response is to become consummate prick with snide, passive-aggressive remarks about our nursing skills that everyone just lets slide because he’s delivered most of this rural area’s babies for the last 40 years.  He reminds us, constantly, how much experience he has, and how good he is at doctoring.  That said, he is actually amazing at some stuff, and will accept chickens and lawnmowing in payment for his services, so I am conflicted about talking shit about him.\n\nBack to the scene:\n\nWe rush back to the operating room, and I scoop her onto the OR table between her wild contractions. Every 4 minutes, she becomes the Tasmanian Devil: writhing, howling, and grunting. I half-sprawl my body across hers to keep this tornado of a person from whirling right off onto the floor. Once one particular 60-second storm subsides - my dearest and actual most favorite anesthesiologist Dr. Diamond Rainbow pushes her mystical white light elixir of the gods into Taz’s IV.\n\nWe all felt a warm balm wash over us as the propofol solved quite a few of our problems.\n\nWith the Whirling Dervish asleep, we could turn our attention to more pressing things, like the half a baby butt peeking through this lady’s labia. (It was a girl, BTW. It was labia in labia. Labiaception for a minute.)\n\nI love Dr. Diamond Rainbow with every fiber of my little nurse heart. She somehow waved her magic wand and settled this patient into a sweet peaceful place: somewhere between methamphetamine, Ativan, Haldol, Propofol, Versed, and Fentanyl…a delightful rainbow of medications…  Taz was able to sleep soundly, but keep her reflexes intact.\n\nMaintaining just enough anesthesia for our Tasmanian Queen of Hawaii to protect her airway... meant she also retained the Ferguson Reflex.\n\nFor those of you who’ve never pushed a baby out: you know that feeling you get when you take a satisfying shit, your face contorts a little and your body goes into an animal hrrrrrrrrnnnggggg… and then you eject a pound and half of yesterday’s tacos? Yeah, that’s actually a reflex.  When you have a 5lb 10oz baby far enough down in your pelvis, your body knows just what to do with it.\n\nYeetus.  That.  Fetus.\n\nSo, the patient slept, and every 3 minutes would push quite effectively. I got to watch Dr. Crusty coach Dr. LaLa through a really lovely breech delivery. Out of hundreds of deliveries I’ve attended in 16 years as an L&D nurse - this is the third breech extraction I have ever witnessed.  Hat trick turned Triple Crown.  I felt like I was witnessing history, with that posterior shoulder delivery.\n\nOh yeah, back to Dr. Crusty.\n\nI’m tucked in against the patient’s hip, feeling her belly for contractions with one hand, and searching with the doppler for heart tones with the other, when Dr. Crusty yells out “Puje!!! Puje!!!” Which is Spanish for “push”. Not only is the patient unconscious, she is Hawaiian, not hispanic. I turn to glare at him over the patient’s draped leg, and see through his goggles that he hasn’t wiped last night’s sleep crust off his face. I catch his squinting, yellow-crusted gaze and mumble “she can’t hear you, Dr. Crusty. And she doesn’t speak Spanish.”\n\nAll’s well that ends well - the baby is fine, actually 37 weeks. The patient slept it all off and then ate everything in the fridge. CPS will be in later today to take her baby (also meth+ on Utox) to foster care, but for now she gets to coo and giggle at her cute little daughter. I took her an 8th cup of coffee before I left, with 6 sugars and 4 creamers, just the way she likes it.\n\n\n\nTL,DR: If a pregnant woman tells you she hurts anywhere between her nipples and her knees… it doesn’t matter how batshit insane she is.  Assume she is in labor, until proven otherwise.\n\n\nEdit: well this blew up.  Thanks for all the encouragement, guys.  I’ll keep writing if you keep laughing.  And, for the love, quit paying for fucking Reddit awards.  God bless /u/spez, but that dude doesn’t need your hard-earned money any more than I do.  Go donate $5 to The Bail Project.  If you PM me about it, I’ll send you a book when I’m done with it.",

    "text": "When I say I don’t want to talk about how my day went ... It’s because I spent my day with a patient who is a DNI (do not intubate) who has been on face mask ventilation for weeks. In the moments between doses of Ativan and dilaudid, he begs “please help me,” “don’t let me die,” and “I can’t breathe” with tears streaming down his face. The mask leaves an extremely gruesome pressure ulcer over the bridge of his nose. The mask isn’t meant to stay that long. The respiratory therapist managed to find a mask that covers the whole face (I call it a scuba mask) but unfortunately it made everything worse. Putting patients in the middle of full code and DNR is the worst way to die. I’m sorry, I’m just going to say it. It’s cruel. I cannot continue to watch a grown man cry and plead for help every day until he dies.. because let’s face it, he’s going to die. \n\nNext door, my other COVID patient has had a massive stroke. She’s in her 20s. I will never forget the sound of her mother wailing on the phone when I told her that the CT results were very bad and warning her about the phone call from the doctor that will soon come. \n\nMy third patient today was a tough one. Thinking back to 3 days ago when I admitted her from the ED, she was on BiPap and actually doing ok. While doing admission paperwork, her HR spiked and I told her to calm down and take some deep breaths. She said “I can’t calm down.. just tell me I’m not going to die.” I held her hand and said nothing. Today, I came in and she was intubated. Later that day, I had to help pick her sister up off the floor when she saw her with a sheet over her face. \n\nI helped another nurse set up a zoom call for her patient so she could watch her daughter’s wedding. Hearing her cry to the sound of wedding music is another sound I will never forget.\n\nSo, no. I don’t want to talk about it tonight.",

    "text": "Patient died. Family is at fault. I'm angry and sad. I'm not a nurse, I'm a nurse aide/ safety sitter. Today I was working as a sitter because bed control needed me to. This is not the first time a patient of mine has died, but it happened today and shouldn't have. This is long. I'm okay, but I'm very angry and very sad.\n\nPatient is early 90's, only has 1 functional lung and COPD, and is NPO NO EXCEPTIONS (there's A LOT of other stuff, but this is the relevant stuff). Wife, daughter, and granddaughter are staying in the room in shifts, clearly a very close family. Doctor has brought up hospice and DNR but family is insistent that \"we do whatever we have to do to keep him alive.\" Man has to be reminded to breathe properly every 10 breaths.\n\nEverything was fine, considering, until 1645 when patient starts to code. During the code, he starts vomiting green liquid that has chunks. Even though we did everything right, he starts choking on the chunks and on the liquid that made it's way into his lungs. The doctor gets forceps and starts getting \"it\" out of his throat. It's green beans. Green fucking beans. The cafeteria had served green beans last night for dinner and today for lunch. Wife had stayed overnight. Daughter had been there all yesterday. Granddaughter had been there all today. All of them had been going to the cafeteria and getting a to go meal at some point during their \"shifts.\" One of them gave him water and green beans. A lot of it.\n\nIdk or care who it was, point is it happened. We had two signs on the door and one on the massive fucking whiteboard in the room: NPO, NO FOOD OR DRINK, NO EXCEPTIONS. We tell family that information at every shift change and everytime the patient asks for food or water. We don't do that shit for kicks. We don't not let someone have food or water 'cause we think it's funny. It's always for a fucking reason. They could get worse or even die. \n\nAfter I clocked out, the patient's wife and granddaughter flagged me down in the parking lot and asked what the response time was for the code. I stuttered out that \"our hospital staff is some of the best around\" and they \"responded immediately and effectively.\" Wife lights a cigarette and thanks me, then drives away with granddaughter. \n\nPatient died, asphyxiating on the vomit that got into his only good lung. There was literally nothing they could have done to save him. Thankfully I was home when I found out.\n\nI don't have words that properly express how furious I am. Furious at the selfishness, the arrogance, the entitlement, the audacity of the patient's family. I can't call it ignorance or stupidity, because the seriousness was made so abundantly clear to them. They chose to do that. This was completely avoidable. I'm sad, I'm fucking heartbroken, because that man didn't deserve to die like that. He didn't deserve to die scared and in pain and surrounded by medical staff instead of family. He didn't deserve to feel the pain during us trying to save his life, which optimistically had (at best) 6 months to a year. I am furious and heartbroken and appalled and incredulous and frustrated. I will probably always be angry and frustrated about this.\n\nIt's not their (patient's family) fault he was old. It's not their fault he was sick. It's not their fault his lungs barely functioned. It is ENTIRELY their fault that he died the way he did. I want to yell it at them till my face turns blue and my voice goes hoarse: THIS WAS YOUR FAULT. I want to yell it at them till they understand that THIS IS YOUR FAULT. I hope the nurses or doctors that informed them of his death made it super fucking clear WHY AND HOW this happened, but I also don't want them to be in more pain then they are already. It's confusing.\n\nI'm home right now. My boyfriend listened to me rant and cry and scream. He's furious and helped me process what happened in a loving and supportive way. Am I always going to be angry about this? I want to always be angry but I also don't. I'm sad and confused. I'll be okay, but I'm still really raw and sore.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your support and kind words. I am already in therapy, but I've taken several people's advice and booked an extra appointment for tomorrow. There was also a little confusion on why the sitter didn't stop the family. Unfortunately, a sitter wasn't authorized untill 1300 of second day on our floor, and that was only because the family wouldn't stop the patient from pulling on his IV's and oxygen. Thank you all so much.",

    "text": "Grief is a powerful emotion, but is it an excuse for this family member's behavior? Sorry for the length. \n\nThis is a soft rant. Meaning I'm frustrated with a patient's family but I'm also understanding because they are grieving. \n\nA couple nights ago, we had a patient suddenly go into cardiac arrest. We (the nurses) weren't really surprised because he was very sick and we had been seeing signs he was declining for a couple days. But the family wasn't expecting it at all, despite us trying to prepare them. The patient had an active plan for some imaging and tests, so we were treating him like he was gonna go on living. However, he was no CPR, so when he coded, we couldn't do anything. He was in his early 80s.\n\nHis wife wailed like her son had just died a sudden and horrific death. She cradled his head and shook it gently like she was trying to wake him up. She screamed in agony like I haven't seen before. It was breaking all of our hearts but we gave her space. \n\nI was sitting outside the room when I noticed a family member fast-walking towards the room with, understandably, a distraught but less understandably slightly angry look on his face. He rushed into the room to hold the patient's wife and I closed the door behind them to give them privacy. \n\nSuddenly, he burst out of the room and screamed down the hall, \"What did you give him?!\" and then went back into the room. I'm sure the entire unit heard him he screamed so loud. I walked to the doorway and before I could say anything, he continued. \"You guys killed him!! You gave him too much of this!\" He pointed at the word Remeron we had written on the whiteboard. I quietly asked him to calm down, flustered by the sudden eruption. \"No! You killed him!! He was fine yesterday! We never should have come to the hospital! You guys just kill people!\" He was screaming at the top of his lungs, holding nothing back.\n\nI turned around to see the patient's nurse approaching, looking distraught as she prepared herself for what she knew was coming. She entered the room and sure enough, the man screamed at her, \"What did you give him?!\" She explained that she had actually held all non-essential meds that night because he was too out of it and lethargic to safely take pills and had soft blood pressures. The man didn't believe her. She even offered to show him the patient's MAR to prove he wasn't given anything overnight. \"I don't care what the computer says! You did this! What kind of a nurse are you? You killed him!\" \n\nI had gotten the charge nurse by now and she took the patient's nurse out of the room and advised her not to go in again. Moments later, I found her crying in the hall and gave her a hug. She was crushed to hear the man saying she killed the patient, even though she knew she literally hadn't done anything but actually practiced safe judgment. The charge nurse let her go home early.\n\nI'm just frustrated now because, while I know the reaction was just out of grief, it's really not an excuse to abuse a nurse like that... The patient hadn't been to the doctor in 30 years. He was very sick, and who knows what else was going on that we hadn't discovered by then? I'm just having a hard time being understanding of the patient's family. \n\nDoes anyone have thoughts on this?",

    "text": "I’m genuinely done. I no longer care. Alright ladies and gents, I had it today. This is a full blown rant, take it or leave it.\n\nI’ve worked CVICU for 6 years, I’ve been used and and abused for a majority of that time, and I’ve literally fucking had it. I had a patient for the last 2 days who’s had numerous stents placed because he just couldn’t give a fuck enough to take his meds or eat a tad bit better or bother working out, no. So he comes to the hospital, gets whatever surgery the doctors might think will keep him alive a bit longer, then takes out his bitter excuse of a life on whoever has to take care of him.\n\nFor the past 2 days, he’s called me a bitch, whore, retard, too stupid to go to medical school, asked to see my qualifications (which he never clarified what the fuck he actually wanted to see, like?), and told me to go back to wiping asses and have the actual doctor come back to take care of him.\n\nEveryone else refuses to take him, all he does is make techs and other nurses cry, so fine. I’ll do it, I don’t give a fuck, but I just had it today. I genuinely had a moment of why am I doing this actually? I have more than enough money in the bank to live comfortably until I find another job, nursing or not, so why am I listening to this stupid fuck of a man call me all these derogatory names while management doesn’t care, the doctors definitely don’t care, no one cares. So guess fucking what! I don’t care either.\n\nI waited out the end of my shift, did everything I had to for the oncoming nurse, then I told this slob to go fuck himself. I truly did. I told him he treated others like shit because he knew he was a piece of shit, and the only thing I wished on him was to go fuck himself. Roughly, thoroughly, and preferably with a fucking rake. I didn’t wait for his stupid ass rebuttal, I just walked to my managers office, and quit. I told her she hadn’t listened to anyone’s concerns about how this man was treating us, so it was no longer my concern how she staffed the unit. \n\nI feel good. I know he was probably in pain and it wasn’t appropriate, but I feel good. I don’t care anymore. I’m tired of being insulted while I’m peeling off shit covered gloves, I’m tired of being called a whore after having just zipped up a body bag, I’m just tired of it. \n\nSo no idea if I’m even going to be a nurse anymore, no idea what I’m going to do in a month, but I don’t care. That’s it. That’s the rant, thanks for coming to my TedTalk.",

    "text": "I quit the Covid ICU after 20months of working in one. Sorry. I quit the Covid ICU and never going back. I’m sorry. \n\nLong time lurker on this subreddit, read and strongly resonate with all the Covid ICU PTSD threads I read, and wonder if I have it. I’ve been working as a nurse for 7 years, and the last 4 years was a medical ICU that turned to COVID ICU feb of 2020. It’s the largest Covid ICU in our state, and we always have most our available (for Covid) ECMO circuits in use, most of our 16 CRRT machines in use. I quit three weeks ago, and still figuring out how to decompress from everything. Anyone got any suggestions?\n\nThe last week I worked, our hospital had all available ECMO circuits in use in , denied 7 outside patient transfers for ecmo eval, one was in their 20s and died the day after we “waitlisted them.” We were rotating 12hrs on/12hrs off patients on CRRT because all of our 16 CRRT machines were in use, and more people needed it than what we could provide, so we  “share” crrt machines to ensure all renally effed patients could get some Blood bathing of some kind for their effed up kidneys. The first three of my last four shifts I took care of a 20yo girl who was emergently c-sectioned and cannualted on my day 1 of 4 for ECMO. Her wish was to be able to breast feed her baby if she survived. So myself and another nurse would breast pump this girl every 3-4 hours, while she was on ECMO, and chemically paralyzed, and all the rest she was my patient for 3 days in a row.  My last shift I was charge, I coded a person on our unit that maybe should have been DNR because of all the metabolic support this patient needed, attended 1 other code in the hospital, and 4 rapid responses in which 3 of these events needed ICU, but were waitlisted, even while inpatient, and actually triaged and gave it to a 30-something year old full code, instead of a 72 yo full code patient. Our MICU is full at 24/24 positive patients, CVICU is full at 24/24, STICU is full (Covid overflow) at 24/24, and Neuro ICU is full at 16/16 Covid positive patients (which is our second Covid ICU. The Neuro patients went to STICU even though STICU is now half Covid icu). Since feb of 2020, we have had over 550 patients die in our hospital of Covid. That’s on average more than one patient dying every other day for 20 months. I got tired of the last conversations with patients, my heart couldn’t take it anymore. \n\nIn the last 4 months, I stopped asking patients why they aren’t vaccinated. We already knew their vaccine status by the time they came to the ICU. I noticed I was asking this to self serve my needs of hearing their excuses probably for fucked up reasons. But all that was doing was stirring fear in their hearts. So instead I stopped asking because in the end it doesn’t change the way I nurse, and sometimes I would have beautiful conversations with these people because they are scared. Fear doesn’t discriminate who it affects. The last conversation I had with a patient before getting the RSI kit, instead of talking about “why didn’t you get vaccinated,” he instead decided to share pictures of his family and told me about how much he loved them and how much they make him laugh. I promised I would take care of him as he gets through this. He died 2 weeks later. But what a special moment that the last meaningful conversation he had was of how proud he was of his family and how much he loved them. I’ll never forget that man. \n\nSo I quit the COVID ICU. I realized that it was affecting every aspect of my life since I noticed all I talk about, even outside of work, the shit I see from day to day, and it pushes away my relationships with some of my friends. I don’t know how to talk about anything else outside of work. I find myself that I’m either quiet, or talking about something sad or effed up that I may have found funny at work. And I don’t like that. So I’m going to heal my heart while I’m unemployed, hone in my hobbies, and learn to be me again. \n\nI’m unemployed until February where I will be starting part time nursing at a small rural hospital in Canada, and full time healing my heart until then! \n\nI don’t know how to be anything else other than what I forced to become in the last 20 months, but I’m excited to find myself again. \n\nTo the nurses, respiratory therapists, techs, CNA’s, doctors still working the front lines of Covid in the ED, floors, and ICUs, I’m sorry I left you. A part of me feels like a failure. But know that you are all fucking amazing, and no one in the world will know the shit you’ve seen in covidland, except for the people around you at work. \n\nCheers. Thanks. And sorry.",

    "text": "Today was the day that broke me For the past year and a half I have been an ICU nurse on various covid units. I have honed covid care like a master artisan hones their craft (as much as anyone can with this wild and bewildering virus). I have diligently followed this sub and all the wonderful nurses here who have hit their breaking point and have wanted to hug or have a drink with each one of you. It's heartbreaking and infuriating but I still had gas in the tank and some fight left in me..... Until last night. \n\nTwo nights ago I had a low 50 something year old gentleman. Covid positive, unvaccinated, no past medical history. I get on and he's anxious as hell on 100% bipap, breathing 45+ times a minute, sat-ing mid 80's, and tiring fast. Que some therapeutic communication, IV chill out juice and helping him self prone. It's working. My man is ok for the moment but we all know we should prepare for the worst. I talk to the provider trying to get some type of prn or drip to help him stay calm and breathing less than 40+ times a minute or the progression to intubation. Suggestions are rejected. However he is ok..... Until 1 am\n\nPanic attack hits. sats in the 50's for 5 minutes and not budging despite more Ativan. I physically lift this man by myself and prone him as he supined himself earlier. Put my call bell on and tell my coworkers to snag the provider. By the time he meanders over I have my patient at 90% but now breathing at 55 times a min. He doesn't even come in the room. He just leaves. I go begging for a precedex drip or some versed. Anything to have this man see his kids on Christmas even if it's through facetime. 2 mgs of Dilaudid later and he's asleep and back to being ok for now. Back to the provider I go \"suggesting\" he call the wife so she can prepare for the possibility of intubation and maybe call and say goodbye. Does that happen? Nope. \n\nNow it's 7 am. My patient has slept some, I've been using my charm all night to keep him calm, he's able to supine, and he can slow his breathing when directed. Sat is 96%. I hand him off to dayshift with the hope that he'll at least make it to Christmas on bipap to make what could be the last holiday memory he ever has with his kids. \n\nI come back later that night and he's dead. The dayshift doc apparently told the family that there was 0% of survival and if he were to be intubated, he'd be dead in a week. They withdraw care and he's dead in hours. \n\nNow was death inevitable? Probably. He already started clotting and this particular ICU manages covid patients abhorrently. I'm talking 2 covid patients have made it out of that ICU not in a body bag in the 3 months I've been here. BUT THAT DOESNT MEAN YOU DONT TRY. THAT DOESNT MEAN YOU TELL A TERRIFIED, ANXIOUS, DELIRIOUS MAN AND HIS FAMILY THAT HE IS GOING TO BE DEAD IN A WEEK.  I find it extremely hard to believe that he knew what was happening. He just wanted the mask off. He'd do whatever the doc said to be able to take the mask off. \n\nI know this is a huge long rant but I tried so f-ing hard to help this man see his kids again just for the doctor to decide he was better off dead.

Prior to my 2018 diagnosis, I led a charmed life; a couple of compressed vertebrae and many, many stitches, lacerations and contusions, all obtained while in the process of having fun. I experienced no serious illness and had little contact with health care organizations, other than office visits and being sutured in the ER, urgent care, or my doctor friend's backyard. Not a single scary, serious issue. Well, that changed. In the past 3 years, I have outlived my untreated prognosis, had sepsis, pneumonia a stem cell transplant and a nasty, very dicey candida infection when I had no immune system.\n\nWith so few exceptions, the medical professionals that I have been helped by have been some of the most competent, patient and compassionate people I could ever imagine. I could not do what you do, in the calm, caring, patient manner you do it. This is almost across the board, spanning 3 hospital systems and two of the United States. My utmost respect and gratitude to you all.",

    "text": "I'm so sick of being abused by patients. I might actually leave the bedside over it I've been a nurse for 3 years. I used to be empathetic and tolerate people's bs because you know, trying to walk in other peoples shoes and stuff.\n\nThis past summer, I have already been filmed by two family members. All in one shift yesterday, I was called \"a fucking bitch\" for trying to just do my job and COVID swab a patient after I fucking politely explained why it's necessary. I was trying to help a creepy old man using a urinal and he said \"it's been a long time since a woman touched my pecker\" to which without even thinking about it I said \"well i'm certainly not doing it for free\" and he went off on me and told me to get the fuck out of his room. Another woman loudly complained about me doing her IV because she was a hard stick and apparently that makes me a bad nurse.\n\nI'm so sick of being yelled at for doing my job. I'm sick of patients treating me like I'm an incompetent and horrible nurse because the IV hurts, or the COVID swab hurts. So it must mean nurse = bad, right? I'm sick of the abuse because antivaxers are mad they still have to wear a mask in the hospital. I don't make the rules here, Karens. Talk to the CEO who makes $2million a year, not me, a lowly peasant. And honestly, I'm sick of being everyone's bitch. So many other departments call me to tell the doctor this, or fix that. No, YOU call the fucking doctor. They have phones too. I'm sick of patients treating the ER like it's a fucking burger king drive thru, then they take it out on me.\n\nI actually somewhat enjoy being a nurse. I love taking care of really sick patients. But patients and their families are so abusive, over asinine shit like linens were on the floor meanwhile I was taking care of your bed bound dad during a busy assignment. I'm sick of patients who could have easily been seen at urgent care, ringing the call light 100x an hour for apple juice and coming up to the nurses station again and again for it while I have a fucking septic workup that should have been in the ICU 7 hours ago but they have to get transferred out. They don't respect us nurses, or even like us.\n\nI'm burnt to the ground. Healthcare is all I have ever known. I volunteered in healthcare in high school, and the minute I graduated started nursing. I grew up semi-poor and it was the most feasible option for me to survive. Yes, I can afford to survive, help my family, buy fun expensive toys. I am absolutely blessed that I got into this career and can survive. But 3 shifts leave me feeling like an empty husk of a person, so there's that. I'm super jealous of my friends who went to four year schools, got the real college experience and make way more than me working on computers all day.\n\nSorry, it's been a horrible week. Wine and midnight mozzarella sticks can't fix this one.\n\nEDIT: Shout out to the patients and families who have basic human decency! I will always fluff and puff you, give you extra warm blankets and all the crackers and turkey sammiches you want!",

    "text": "The case of the stolen foreskin Grab a snack, because this is a good one.\n\nSo we’ve all heard some outlandish shit from pts and family members about what they think we want to do, are doing, or have done, in the name of money, power, sadism, you name it. Sometimes these accusations come from people who are deeply frightened and overwhelmed about the medical situation at hand, and I really am sympathetic for them as hospitals are scary and sickness is scarier. But other times, the things that come out of their mouths are just…fucking mind boggling.\n\nWe had a pt, ~70s/M, transferred to us by helicopter from Podunk General Hospital for some issues related to advanced CHF and AKI, causing respiratory distress and yadda yadda. Dude was a hot mess when he rolled in. He arrived on NRB, incredibly edematous, and it took us a while to get him settled. A Foley catheter is placed per doc’s orders. After a period of time, we get his sats in an acceptable range, the ball is rolling to address the underlying cause, and the pt is as comfortable as possible. Pt’s wife and daughter arrive by personal vehicle a little while after. Daughter steps out to go get something to eat for her and her mom.\n\nSome time later, the wife marches out to the desk where some of us are sitting, wearing what I can only describe as “sour bitch face.” She immediately demands to speak to the patient advocate. We are all a little stunned by this, because he had just arrived and was doing pretty good while the doc’s were mapping out and executing their treatment plan. If anyone demands to see the patient advocate, we call them right away without a reason because they don’t need a “satisfactory” reason for that consult. So we agree to call them, and while our charge nurse is off placing that call, the pt’s nurse asks the wife if there is something wrong.\n\nWife: “Absolutely! My husband was never circumcised, but since he arrived here it’s clear that his foreskin has been removed. It’s beyond unethical and I demand answers!”\n\nCue dumbfounded silence. Excuse me, ma’am? Did we hear you correctly??\n\nWife: “His foreskin is gone, and it was certainly still there at Podunk General Hospital, meaning it had to have been you people that circumcised him, probably to make it easier to put in that catheter. I want to speak to the patient advocate and the doctor that authorized this!”\n\nWe gently but firmly insist that at no point was her husband relieved of his foreskin, but this only irritates her further. She starts getting louder, yelling that we stole her husband’s foreskin and we won’t get away with it, then turns and walks back into her husband’s room.\n\nThe patient advocate, who we had called back and briefed on the…unusual situation he was walking into, just looked baffled as he walked down the hall and into the room. The man certainly earned his pay that evening.\n\nYou just can’t make this shit up.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the awards!!",

(Lengthy) Anyone who works an impatient nursing or pays attention on this sub for literally half a second understands the current burdens of acute health care.  I just finished up a progressive care unit contract contract and I'm heading home for a couple of weeks which has really given me some time to evaluate the current state of things.\n\nI've always envisioned rationing of care as the worst possible scenario,  for example having 2 patients in the ER who both need a ventilator and there's only one ventilator available.  Always thought to myself \"man how wild would that be to be in a situation like that,  Basically choosing who gets to live and who gets to die\".\n\n For my experience the current state of inpatient nursing and acute healthcare is a straight up cluster fuck.  There is not enough nurses, there is not enough doctors, sometimes there's not enough supplies to provide best practice for all of our patients.  People that need an ICU bed are sent to step down people that need a Step-down bed are sent to med-tele.  \n\nWhat you end up with are people that are too sick to be where they are at with not enough resources to properly care for them.\n\n\n What you get are people that are being emergently intubated or worse coded (and most of you probably know just HOW MANY resources go into a  newly recessitated patient).\n\n\n This results on average worse patients outcomes  for the entire health care system, covid or not.\n\n\n The obvious answers would never suffice. A portion of the general public honestly thinks covid is a hoax,  Another portion thinks nurses are short staffed because they're all being fired for not vaccinating, and it's Bidens fault.  Then you have another seemingly significant portion of the population who is either unable or unwilling to manage their own health in a positive manner and insists on calling an ambulance every time they stub a toe.\n\n\n All I know is we are tired. I can't stop because I have a family to provide for and tens-thousands of dollars and student loans to pay back.  All I hope for is that some deranged maniac doesn't come into the hospital and shoot everyone up for \"killing people with ventilators\". All I want is my friends, family, neighbors to be safe.",

Nowadays that is (or should be) no longer the case with many more women becoming doctors, yet the proportion of men in nursing hasn't grown nearly as much (at least in the UK). Nursing has also become a much more respected profession in the past few decades, yet the societal culture still very much feels like its not a \"manly\" career to go into and men often get stigmatised and negatively labelled for becoming nurses.\n\nGiven the clear gender pay gap seen in so many different sectors, is it not obvious that there is still an underlying misogynistic tone to the lack of a reasonable pay increase? To be blunt about it, if there were more men in the profession then there would be a culture shift and the male dominated society we live in would give more of a shit about giving us a fair wage.",

    "text": "Patient's son quipped at me to \"do something else if I hate my job so much\" **Context:**\n\nI work in an Emergency Department of a busy city hospital in Australasia that services a predominantly low socioeconomic community with high needs.\n\nEVERYONE comes to the ED for just about anything from minor complaints that are best dealt with in primary care to your actual emergencies.\n\nLast night our waiting area was heaving with 30 patients at midnight with no flow and we had patients who still hadn't been seen by nurses or doctors since 2000hrs. We had no more beds inside ED for patients that require assessment spaces.\n\n**Storytime:**\n\nI see this 80 year old man at triage who has not opened his bowels for the last 4 days, complaining of moderate abdo pain but has had no vomitting . His elderly wife is insisting he needs to be in the ED after speaking to a telehealth triage nurse who told them to come straight to the ED 😑.\n\nI proceeded to advise them that the waiting time to actually get seen by a doctor won't be until after 8am given the fact that our department is clogged up with unnecessary presentations and equally unwell people in the resus and monitoring areas.\n\nThe wife obviously gets mad at the long waiting time, by this time my voice is already louder and short because trying to explain you have no control over the waiting time is just not comprehensible to this woman. She then demands to her grandson to call the telehealth line again in an effort to get them to tell us to somehow hurry up and see the patient ASAP. I then explained to her NO ONE HAS ANY CONTROL of how long a waiting time is in AN ED. She then says, \"we'll just call an ambulance\" to which I respond with \"that won't make a difference - just because you come in an ambulance doesn't mean you get seen quicker.\"\n\nI spent about ten minutes with this woman to explain people get seen on the basis of how sick they are and unfortunately her husband likely has constipation. By this stage they call her and the patient's son in, and cue the absolutely condescending manner of speech this man gave me.\n\nHe basically explains why they're there, and I'm trying to tell them, I'm merely explaining to your mother how long the waiting time is, and if they're prepared to wait. The reason the teletriage nurse said to come in to ED was a manner of being cautious in case it wasn't a constipation but a bowel obstruction. He basically insults the skills of the teletriage nurse and then says to me \"if you don't like doing your job, then maybe you should do something else\".\n\nI shook my head at his comment and basically looked up at him and dead in the eyes I said \"we're all doing our best here with that we've got. Would you like to be in my position?\". Whether he actually had any understanding on the amount of pressure we were in or still held onto the belief of self importance, I will never know. He however did not say anything after that comment.\n\nI am seriously so sick of these people. I've basically reached a point where I cannot help but talk back at these kinds of comments. I hate to admit it but it bothers me that people insult us and yet when they need help they come running demanding to be seen ASAP. I feel like these are the kinds of people who treat nurses like their personal maids.\n\nJust needed to vent to people who hopefully will be more empathetic to what I'm dealing with.\n\nedit: formatting and grammar",

    "text": "Teachers never get what they really deserve. (Please ignore any grammar errors. I’m typing this at 1am right now.)\n\nI know this isn't something that's normally posted here, but I felt it was needed.\n\nMy entire life has been a constant struggle and it has deeply affected my education. When I was 11, a couple day before my 12th birthday, I develop heart failure after catching a rare virus. My doctors guessed that I got it at school and the school was informed. I missed months of school while sick in the hospital and while recovering from my heart transplant a month later. It was a life changing event and I developed depression while stuck in an extremely small Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.\n\nI spent the first month thinking I wouldn’t survive while thinking I would never finish the 6th grade or see my friends ever again. However, a month later I had a successful heart transplant and my city’s board of education made it so much better by making a plan for me and started a 504 plan, to continue my education with a home teacher and then re-entering in-person school. My home teacher was so kind, generous, and supportive, and kept reminding that I can catch up. I was able to go back 4 months later, the first day after spring break. Everything went as planned.\n\nThree years later, I developed Post-Transplant Lymphoma Disorder in the brain and another form of liver cancer. It was exactly two months after my 15th birthday when I was diagnosed. I was back in the hospital and the B.O.E again created another plan and added on to my 504 plan for me to continue school at home and come back in-person after treatment. Fatigue was one of the first symptoms and many more came after. I went from a straight A student to failing all of my classes. It was my first year of high school so they didn’t know I was a good student and a few always judged me but when I came back, I meet amazing new teachers who made up for all of it. I ended up in and out of high school for 6 years and graduated at 20 years old but with the most supportive teachers, staff, and principals.\n\nThe school kept me sane by always reminding me that my health comes first before any assignment or test and to always focus on myself. I was always told I was their most favorite, dedicated, and hardest working student they’ve ever seen. I was always treated as an adult and allowed to do whatever I needed to do. I still maintained my straight A’s while in and out of school fighting cancer. I was able to do it become of them and their constant encouragement.\n\nOne of my main issue was being in a building of students who continuously complained about every single thing about school. They complain about seating, homework, assignments, tests, teachers, etc. I fought my ass off to stay alive and then go back to school so I could be Pediatric Cardiologist working with the people who saved me. I was 17 went I went back, half day in-person, half day at home online with another amazing home teacher. I was so excited and nervous to back but I definitely felt the difference between me and the other students. It was hard and very tiring, there were times where I fell asleep in class, but I paid attention and worked the hardest I could. I hated working my ass off while other students joked around, wasted class time, and fought with the teacher every single day. I stopped feeling like a teenager because my life was nothing like the others, the maturity levels had a huge gap, and priorities were a huge difference. Students, themselves, were affecting my health. I have chronic headaches 24/7 ever since the cancer developed and students fighting and yelling in class made them worse. These teachers were amazingly kind and helpful in some of my worst moments in my life and I finally started to snap and shut down a student everytime they were disrespectful. \n\nThere was one day in my final year of high school were I completely went off on a whole class of seniors. It was a college prep math class for seniors, this teacher had a doctorate degree but was teaching bratty teens thinking they were ready for real life but couldn't handle homework. This man was incredibly kind and his wife works in the emergency room that I frequently visit, it's enough that they have to deal with my health issues in class (I've left school in ambulances many times), but also out of school. I digress, back to the story. This day, I had a major headache and everyone chose this particular day to spend the entire class arguing and daily homework and weekly tests. I just had enough of it, got up, and yelled at everyone. \"How do you expect to adults in the real world if you can't even handle fucking homework? You don't even know how damn lucky you were to even be in school when there are kids everywhere who can't go to school. I can't believe how you guys sit here, whining and whining every single day about homework and tests taking school for granted........You guys really think you're going to be adults next year.....whiny kids!\" I yelled for over 20 minutes and walked out. Apparently the whole floor heard me, the principles came looking for me to tell me how lucky I am for not being able to be fired and asked how good did it feel to let it all out, knowing everything I've been through. The rest of the week was the same, teachers and staff I knew came up to me saying the same thing. One girl in the class even apologized to me and said she finally realized how stupid she was acting. Class went differently from then on. \n\nOverall, I'm 22 and finally in college and this just a big **THANK YOU TO ALL YOU TEACHERS OUT THERE! You guys deserve better than the shit you go through everyday!**",

    "text": "Principal told me a kid can’t have the new strain because “no cases have been reported” in my state that doesn’t care about testing anyway. I’m so done. My school has switched to an A/B schedule to avoid closing down since cases are so bad here. This means that half of our kids come on Monday/Tuesday and the other half come on Wednesday/Thursday. Our gigantic turd of a governor has been gaslighting and doing everything he can to guilt us into being “safely back in school” without actually doing anything to help us be safe, so this is our solution. \n\nYesterday, one of my kids who I already know has had COVID twice (once in August and once in December) got COVID again. His doctor thought it was the new strain because he had already had it twice so there was no other logical conclusion. He asked the kid that sits next to him to call me during their time in my class so that I could give him the instructions for our assignment that day since he would be working from home, which is how I found all of this out. \n\nKid that sits next to him chooses the end of class to say, “Man, I really don’t feel well today. I’m nauseous and I feel dizzy!” Which, great, he probably has COVID too and he was in my class for 53 minutes. \n\nI get a phone call at the beginning of my next class asking who sits by the kid who tested positive, and told the secretary what the kid told me on the phone. I asked if my class would need to quarantine if Kid B tested positive and she said she would “do some investigating”. Whatever the hell that means. \n\nTowards the end of the day, my principal calls. I’m thinking, “Great. Here it is. I have to quarantine AGAIN and I’m probably going to get sick AGAIN.” Nope. First words out of his mouth are, “So who told you Kid A had a different strain?” I explain the situation and tell him Kid B is feeling sick, and he said, “Okay, well, there’s no way to know if he has a different strain because no cases have been reported here.” I said, “Well, we probably aren’t looking for them anyway so how would we know if there is or isn’t?”\n\nI’m so tired of this. Nobody in admin at my school has one shred of empathy towards us. Nobody can tell us when teachers in my state are set to be vaccinated. I feel like I’m just waiting to get sick again, and I worry about both my mental and physical health if I do. I’m terrified to take my mask off in my classroom, even to eat. I wish we would just go virtual until the end of the year because my state has one of the highest per capita test positivity in THE WORLD and yet we are still open and acting like nothing is wrong.",

I just.. it baffles me. I’ve never seen anything like it. Usually, if an assignment is over 2 days late it goes directly to a 50% when they turn it in (my policy) but if i can’t afford to keep this policy when students don’t do their work. \n\nI don’t assign homework. Students have time in class to work and we have workdays on Wednesday’s, yet they still do not turn in assignments. It’s a huge problem at my school.. and administration loves to hold teachers accountable rather than students. I use the remind app, i email, i try to stay in contact with parents.. but I’m at a loss right now.. \n\nThe victim mindset some of these kids have is just sad.. and don’t get me wrong, i have some shining stars that do everything they are supposed to do, and even if they don’t get the grade they wanted they work towards it and meet with me. I’m willing to work with any student but I’m not willing to put in excessive amounts of time to receive nothing in return. If i help you, you have to take advantage of that. Instead of challenging every word i say, follow the directions and do what you’re supposed to. It’s school. It’s not a party everyday and you’re going to have to do things you don’t want to do. That’s life. I pray for some of these kids getting ready for college.. cuz professors don’t accept late work or give extensions unless you’ve proven yourself to be a good student or you have a doctors note. \n\nSorry, rant over.

    "text": "Imagine being this disconnected from reality... So, I just got an email from our ESD Superintendent.\n\nFirst off, an explanation for what an \"Education Services District\" (ESD) in my state is:\n\nA while ago (I don't know.. 20-30 years ago) school districts decided that running school districts was too hard. This made sense for smaller districts, which don't have the ability to do all the things that are required of a larger school district. So, the state formed the ESD's. However, the state basically forced districts to pay money to these ESDs from their budgets, meaning that it resulted in positions leaving the districts, and going to these ESDs.\n\nThese ESD's were originally designed to do small tasks that small districts couldn't do individually. Buy shared curriculum. Organize subs. That was kinda it.\n\nNow, the ESD's have become MASSIVE conglomerations of self-perpetuating bureaucracy. They have their own lobbyists, they get themselves elected to school board positions. There are literally HUNDREDS of employees there. And they have NO connections to actual schools. They view themselves as a step above the school districts.\n\nOn top of that, they have become an anti-union force to be reckoned with.  They work as a cabal, organizing districts to keep pay low throughout the area, both for teachers, and for subs. ESPECIALLY for subs, since they run the sub pool. They have kept sub rates the same for... probably about 15 years. Even during this massive sub shortage. And when districts or unions try to raise sub rates, they say it's not possible, because every district has to agree to raise sub rates.\n\nThey also told districts that the MOST that they could give ANY teachers union was a 3.1% raise, while the districts themselves were seeing 15% increases in the funds coming in for teaching positions.\n\nON TOP OF THAT, these so called \"Education Services Districts\" no longer allow school districts to use their buildings. Yeah. They have MASSIVE buildings, with MASSIVE meeting rooms. But school districts can't use them any more. Not because of COVID. Because they want to keep them for ESD functions.\n\nSo, today, we got this fucking email from this fucking guy who is the head of our ESD:\n\n>Welcome back to the new school year. Of course, by the time you read this it will likely be well into the fall, but I hope you know that I am thinking about how it is starting for you. We had hoped for a bit more of the old normal, but it feels like we are on to the next normal. One thing I hear consistently is how excited people are to be together again in person. Children and students in classrooms, staff in meetings, and all of us learning how to respond to the next crisis.\n\n(So, you wrote this email when? August? Too busy to send it then? Oh, and you're thinking of us? So grateful! When entire schools shut down as COVID ran through the staff and students, were you thinking of us, or giving us \"thoughts and prayers?\" You think we're glad to be in person, or is that just you talking to your district superintendents and school board golf buddies? You really think we're excited to be in staff meetings? Yeah, you DEFINITELY didn't talk to any teachers.)\n\n>I have to confess: I am a huge fan of Ted Lasso. I learn how to be a better human being, plus I gain a few new words in an already colorful vocabulary, with every episode. Among countless quotes and funny quips, I found this one by Ted to stick the most: “It’s funny to think about how the things in your life that make you cry just knowing they existed, can then become the same things that make you cry knowing that they’re now gone. I think those things come into our lives to help us get from one place to a better one.” Yes, I am reaching for something positive in a time of traumatic stress—and I won’t be crying when COVID is gone—but it sure has taught me about life, learning, and leading.\n\n(OMG, you're a fan of the biggest show in the country right now? NO WAY! You know what makes me cry? The fact that your fucking ESD basically skims a huge percentage off my district's budget, and does nothing to help to actually serve the district. Oh, and as for being a LEADER? HA! You're the leader the way that a General Melchett is a leader in Black Adder Goes Forth, jackass.)\n\n>As we journey together into our second full season of COVID, I hope to find a way to get from this place to a better one. In the midst of uncertainty, I want to focus on the things that truly mean the most: family, friends, and making a difference in lives. Focusing on the reason for our work puts reason into the craziest of moments. I believe we all do what we do because we want our lives to matter. We want to know the world was a bit better because we were in it for a brief span of time. And when we pass, we can rest knowing we helped someone get from one place to a better one.\n\n(If we've learned NOTHING from your fucking ESD it's that we can be certain that YOU will put yourself first, and we have to do everything we can to make sure that WE put our families first. You four flusher. \"AND WHEN WE PASS\"? Jesus fuck, dude. This is just a job. A job that people like you drive us away from.)\n\n>As this year unfolds, I hope you can pause, reflect and refocus on your why. Grounding yourself in what gives you life can help carry you through the toughest moments. We are more than educators working in our spaces and places—we are a team. We each contribute to a common goal: to help the children of today move toward their best selves tomorrow. We may not hear fans cheering for us, but I hope you know you are surrounded by countless witnesses who see you showing up every day, giving your all.\n\n(Fuck. You.)\n\n>Thank you for all you do to make the world just a little bit better and to make lives shine just a little more brightly.\n\n(Nah, seriously, man. Fuck. You.)\n\n>Dr. Fuckface\n\n(Of COURSE he had to point out that he is a doctor.)\n\n>Superintendent\n\n(Just sign your name embezzler, and move on.)",

    "text": "Male students harassing female teachers Hi everyone.   \n\n\nThis is going to be the very first post I have ever made. It's long, not sure how to shorten it without leaving out a lot of context. Obligatory \"not a teacher\" and \"English not first language\". But I have found very little on this topic, and would like to ask for some advice, or just insight on if whether or not anyone has ever gone through something similar. So...here it goes.   \n\n\nMy longtime partner in life is a highschool teacher, teaching french in Costa Rica (French is an obligatory 2nd language in most schools over here) at a private school. Over the past 5 years she has received varying degrees of abuse from students, mostly verbal. She's a sweet, but tough person. She doesn't tolerate disrespect in her classroom and sticks to the rules, but is never rude or condescending to her students and really cares about all of them. She will socialize with them and interact with them but makes sure to keep clear boundaries (such as no hugs, no touching her, no sharing of personal details like Facebook, Instagram or any other kind of social media and no pet names), this to avoid any possible misunderstandings that could cost her job and career. You can imagine which ones I am referring to. Anything that could ever point to inappropriate conduct between a young, attractive teacher and students.   \n\n\nAnyways, taking the above into account, she's been having issues with 4 students ever since they started highschool. At first, both the school and her considered they were just kids being kids. They would throw a few insults at her or try to cross the above boundaries during the 1st and 2nd year. In the course of that time, they had various discipline issues, such as bullying other students, causing fights or failing their tests and not doing their tasks and homework.   \n\n\n3rd year starts. 2 of those 4 students molest and harass other female students. Parents threaten the schoolboard that if nothing is done about this, they will take their daughters out of the school. The usual case of \"nude pics\" being passed around and other cases cause 13 students to be transferred. School psychologists decide to implement \"mending procedures\" and \"positive action\" to talk to the students. They deny everything, or say that they feel like the school is harassing THEM instead. The parents of those 2 students back it up, so the school give them the benefit of the doubt and buries the whole thing as a case of over sensitive parents, and teachers (including my partner) not understanding the sensitive minds of young kids.   \n\n\nA few kids continue to leave the school, my partner starts to get catcalled by the 4 culprits, and any kind of disciplinary action against these students turns into a call to the principals office in which my partner is being told that she can't keep noting down her students for being kids. They're just confused and need to be explained nicely, not disciplined. Ok...so she tries that instead. This just evolves into them making fun of her, catcalling her a bit more and insulting her, to the dismay of other students and a few teachers who witness the entire thing. During this whole thing...she still keeps her composure...  \n\n\nPandemic hits, 1 year of rest from those students...and then this year starts...  \n\n\nDuring all of 2021, the same 4 students have so far barked at her on the school yard, followed her into different classrooms (that they are not a part of), interrupted her classes, brazenly insulted her, catcalled her and most recently stepped it up to threatening her, backing her up against walls, showing up behind her and whispering things into her ear and stating that they would find out where we lived if she dared speak up about any of it. They are now 17 years old...  \n\n\nShe has developed severe anxiety, ended up in the hospital due to a mental breakdown and has become increasingly afraid to return to school...  \n\n\nThe school offered psychiatric assistance and offered to open up a case against them. Which she accepted...only for the school to try to convince her to drop it immediately after since they were gonna graduate soon anyways.   \n\n\nThe school is no help, so she tried contacting other outlets, but every \"specialist\" on the matter either say she should feel flattered to have students catcalling her, or that the threats aren't real...they're just kids and she's the adult who should simply ignore them.   \n\n\nIdk what to do to help her. I've told her to quit and I will shoulder the expenses until we are able to find her something else, but she refuses to resign until she has found something else (hard during the pandemic). She feels humiliated, misunderstood and her mental health is in decline. Not a day goes by where she doesn't cry. But doctors and psychologists refuse to assist her...they say she's ok, and basically to get over it. Or just take an ungodly amount of pills to numb her. As a man in today's seemingly \"progressive\" world...I don't understand how no one will give a damn about a female teacher going through this with 17 year old, male students...in one year, they will be legal adults, taking part in the world. Mind you...these are highly privileged students, sons of doctors and lawyers too...  \n\n\nI hope anyone got this far...but if not...\n\n**tl;dr:** Have you, as a woman, ever been harrassed by male students and everyone around you simply played it down? What did you do? And what would you do if it was affecting your health and no one is willing to help?",

I've been working as an operations manager/executive assistant/whatever-I-need-to-be for a growing construction company since 2019. I started out part-time making $15/hr as an admin, then went full-time and eventually grew it to $25/hr by basically just helping the owner run the business.

My biggest goal in life is to be financially independent and have the freedom to do what I want. I could continue working, go back to college for another 2 years, or start my own business/be self employed. I know only I can know for sure what is best for me, but any advice/input/wisdom from others would be greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "Can anyone help give some advice on a career change ?? Changing a career path .. help. So I’m a 26 year old female and I’ve been a chef for the last 7 years . It’s all I know and I’ve never gone to school outside of graduating highschool. I’ve worked my way up from a dish washer all the way up to now a head chef. I’ve worked for large corporations, well respected ones but “chains” none the less . I’ve put in SO many hours and worked so fucking hard to get where I am - but the longer I’m working at these places it’s just ruined it for me. It’s not even about the food or cooking anymore, it’s all about micromanaging the people and numbers and getting shit on (everyone, not just myself.) I’ve seen so much stuff happen, from my head chef SAing myself and other underage girls - with a pregnant wife at home. To having to work 60 hours a week , working during heat waves where people are getting sick with plus 60•C and sewer water coming through the floors were forced to work in. I can tell a million stories and I’m very grateful for everything I’ve learned because cooking has saved my life and I love cooking so much, but - the atmosphere is SO toxic in every restaurant I’ve been in.  Constant gossip and bullying - the higher ups told us that we are “not chefs because we don’t make the menu “ which .. what kind of inspiration and motivation is that ? A man had a heart attack from the extreme stress of our job a few weeks ago, and he came back to work 1.5 weeks later and they cared more about labour than his safety and cut everyone but himself making him work 14 hours even when complaining of pain. I understand of course trying to run a buisness and the money side of things but at what point do we look after our staff as well ? Now I’ve gotten carpal tunnel from work and I’ve continued to work but I wasn’t taken seriously at all even with doctors notes and confirmed surgery.  I repeatedly was telling my bosses I was in pain and last Saturday my lead Prepper had to go home so I was down a prep on a busy day. I called my boss, asked to have one other person in on the day and he told me no . I told him I would then have to prep even when he knew about wrist and he hung up on me ??? I can barely open my hand at all now and can’t grip anything and am taking some time off before my procedure because I’m not permanently screwing myself up for a company that doesn’t seem to give a shit. It’s been 5 days since I left and I’ve had to reach out 4 times to even get one email regarding info for HR which my GM told me he would get to me days ago. He’s always on his phone which is apart of his job so I know he’s doing this on purpose .. now I find out his wife who works at another location is talking about how annoyed he is with my situation to other people are disclosing my medical info ?? I’m insulted and hurt because I absolutely work my ass off and I KNOW I’m good at what I do - I also genuinely care about my team and people - so I’m mystified why he’s treating my situation that I literally can’t help like this .. after years of dedication, blood , sweat and tears I’m just at my wits end . I don’t mind hard work at all but being worked like a dog to not being cared about at ALL and being abused so long in this industry - I’ve had enough. I wanted to be a chef for the FOOD and love of food . Not this . So I’ve taken looking into school online and I’m very seriously considering going to be a Medical Office Administrator. It pays about the same for way less physical work . I just wanna go to work, make my money, do my job and go home now - not deal with any politics or bullshit. I really don’t think I’m being dramatic in thinking thinking this is fucked ? .. it’s bitter sweet . Im sad because ive always seen me doing nothing else but being a chef but all the bullshit is severely effecting my mental health. I have constant anxiety and can’t sleep half the time .. I just want to know if you guys think this is the right decision because I’m feeling lost and very undervalued and after all the work I’ve put in, it’s not a good feeling at all. Thanks guys .",

I could really use some insight with my situation, and I'm going to extrapolate my situation while describing pathways below. Essentially, I (at 31 years old) am considering one of the possible pathways to pursue. I want a stable career that is conducive to raising a family. I am based in California\n\n**Teaching Credential**\n\nI currently have a Master's degree in what used to be an in-need subject in education: Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages. I taught as a lecturer in university and an adjunct professor at community college for three years, before I got fed up with the working conditions and left. I loved what I did, but it was a dead-end: I knew people who were doing that for 10, 15, or 20 years without ever getting a fulltime job. People in this position have no real retirement plan, and haven't visited a doctor in years because the schools will not give them health insurance.\n\nPROS:\n\n* I am already a practiced teacher with all the skills, and I know what age range I would want to teach (Middle school).\n* K-12 teaching jobs are full-time, guaranteed. The schools would have no choice but to give me a full-time job, and medical insurance.\n* A teaching job would be most conducive to raising a family. Travel is important to me, and with school breaks we could travel to my heart's content.\n\nCONS\n\n* I would need to get a California teaching credential, which would take 2 additional years of school (taking useless classes) and $15,000.\n* Things like job protection, benefits, and pay are all being attacked in US society. I would essentially need to pay a significant amount of money to get the license to work a job that almost everyone quits within 5 years. While I've found that I get respect from individuals when I tell them I'm a teacher, the US government treats us like they hate us. I recently caught up with a friend who is a commissioned officer in the US Army. He told me that the army pays for all of his family's expenses, and gives gigantic bonuses and per diems. This would not be that.\n* My job (in US education) would be to prepare students to attend college/university. I know first-hand how badly US higher education is falling apart. I'd essentially be part of a system preparing them for failure.\n* I hated my coworkers, when I was a teacher. I don't need to get into it, but I was amazed at how bad people were at this job. Teachers tend to be \"book smart\", but astoundingly life stupid.\n* Education in the US is a feminized environment, and I'm a man. These types of environments don't appreciate gender diversity. In my experience, they want to limit men coming into their departments as much as possible; they will only hire other women to positions of authority, etc.\n\n**Data Science**\n\nI've discovered that I have something of a passion for probability, risk, and statistics. I think I would love a job in which I worked on polling data for a politician. I have a degree in Applied Linguistics and did my Master's thesis on verbal and participatory elicitation. I'm imagining something in which I conduct research on how well the public responds to policy phrasing and public opinion.\n\n EDIT: I forgot to mention that I did an internship in a community college's institutional research/effectiveness center. The Dean of the department was a really weird guy (seems commonplace in these environments. Hard workers beg for scraps, while the freaks are given 6-figure jobs with no work) but I liked the nature of the work a lot. *Essentially, I'm interested in creating and analyzing surveys.*\n\nPROS:\n\n* I feel like this is an in-demand skill world-wide. It has ultimately been my goal to leave the United States, and I feel like this could allow me to do that.\n* The job market is real. This wouldn't be like my days as a teacher, hustling to work for less-than-minimum wage.\n* The work would be intellectually stimulating and dynamic. It would offer me a mix of the stability I desire, with something that satisfies me.\n\nCONS:\n\n* I would have to go back to school. I've seen first-hand how bad American education is, and I always hesitate with something that requires me to subject myself to more school.\n* I would need to finance my own education. However, I don't see this as being as big of a con as the teaching credential, as I could focus on employable skills (i.e. the classes wouldn't be as useless).\n* I fear that it could lead me to a job that requires me to spend my days in front of a computer screen. I like interacting with other people. I want to focus on a more social job.\n\n**Boat Deckhand**\n\nAfter I left education after teaching in higher ed for three years, I decided to take other jobs to explore other career possibilities. I first took an entry level job at a luxury hotel in their spa, and I loved everything about it, apart from the management/hotel leadership. I loved that it was lightly social but would allow alone-time as well; I loved working as part of a team, with both men and women; furthermore, I loved that the job was lightly physical. I was eventually fired after I reported our management for inappropriate behavior, but I still have fond memories of the spa. I don't want to get into the specifics of my next job, but it was servicing a hot air balloon. The balloons are somewhat comparable to boats, as you need to work as a team to keep it moored and under control with the use of specific rope knots, it accommodates passengers, etc. This job was more physical and outside, which I liked. As a big negative, it had abusive management. I was forced to leave after I found them breaking the law, but I am expecting a sizeable settlement from this position.\n\nPROS:\n\n* The jobs is outdoors, it is technical and social, and I would work on certain skills that I've come to appreciate. The job descriptions I've read list accommodating passengers as a job function, and that was one of my favorite parts about hospitality.\n* I wouldn't need to go into debt to gain these skills. I could either attend a maritime science program (one of the community colleges I used to teach for has a respectable one), or according to another redditor the employers will train you on the job.\n* It's a full-time job. After I was burned so badly in the teaching world, I have come to appreciate anything and everything that is a full-time job.\n\nCONS:\n\n* I worry about the schedule. I'm looking for something that would allow me to have a family life, and not something that is going to bring me away from my family for days and weeks on end. Some deckhand jobs allow you to go home every night, so I would focus on that.\n* The job posting I've seen require \"at least 1 year of relevant experience.\" I worry that, even if I do a Maritime science degree, I won't make the qualification for 1 year of experience.\n* I'm 31 years old, and I don't want to do a lot of bitch work or get yelled at by someone born after 9/11. This is also why I hesitate to become a paralegal, and one reason I decided against joining the US Coastguard.\n\n**Financial Advisor**\n\nI have a passion for personal finance, which I discovered in my adult life. After I finished my degree in education, I taught myself the fundamentals (because, again, personal finance is not taught in US schools), and I discovered that it gave me very real, very salient power.\n\nPROS:\n\n* I have found the major three investment brokers (Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Vanguard) to be the most competent, user friendly, and frankly intelligent institutions I have ever interacted with. It stood out to me because US schools have been so abhorrent.\n* I looked online at, for example, entry level jobs with Fidelity. They're full-time (yay!) and would require me to acquire some licenses that I believe would only take a few months.\n* Personal finance is something near and dear to me on a personal level. Learning the fundamentals as an adult has been life changing, and has improved every aspect of my life (even outside of my finances). It is a passion; I am a devoted listener to the Clark Howard show, and have given my friends and family advice. To me, it would possibly be a way to combine my experience with teaching with my passion for personal finance.\n\nCONS:\n\n* I would be working for a major corporation (most likely Fidelity. My ideal is to work for the government, so I'd aim for that eventually I think). I've been burned in the past by private companies. I don't trust the private sector.\n* I worry about sedentary work. I am a physical person, I enjoy time outdoors. I do not want to work in front of a computer all day.\n* Work/life balance is important to me. Teaching allows me to travel, yet I'm not so sure this pathway would be as generous in that regard.\n\nThank you so much for your thoughts.",

Taking 1-2 years to change a job is actually quite normal and you can apply to a shit tonne of companies without getting a single interview. \n\nInside a big corporate we get like 100-200 resumes / day for each vacancy. You read that right. Per day! \n\nTo top it all I've seen volunteers in almost all CSR activities teaching everyone how to code.

There's this movement to sell everyone the dream of joining IT and making big bucks.\n\nWhenever the common man asks me what job I do and I say \"IT\" he immediately assumes that I must be filthy rich, jumping into a swimming pool full of money and making cigars out of currency notes.\n\nWe are churning out a hell load of graduates every year who have a degree in comp-science and/or IT and 80% of them will never get into the IT industry.

He put in some fake experience and secured a job.\n\nIs it time to stop encouraging non-IT people to join the IT stream? We had an IT boss who came over from manufacturing industry who brought with him horrible manufacturing-centered work-culture (like discipline in office timings in spite of flexible hours policy) and zero domain/technical knowledge.

    "text": "Are companies expecting to much of us? I posted a comment about this mostly as a rant but I was curious what others opinions are.\n\nHas anyone else noticed companies more often asking for coding challenges or just ridiculous interview processes just to work at some small 100-200 employee company?\n\nI have a job I’ve had since 2019 so I’ve been comfy but I always explore new avenues cause why not? I’ve noticed more and more that companies are asking more of us in the sense of side projects and the part that really irks me is coding challenges. I know there’s some of you guys that are leetcode junkies but personally I always saw that as something to go above and beyond if I want to work at FAANG. Although the pay is amazing, I have no desire to work at these companies as I still want a life that doesn’t revolve completely around CS. I am happy with a job that pays decently and I can still have hobbies and a social life and just me time. I don’t want to live and breathe CS man I already stare at code for 8 hours a day.\n\nI’ve noticed the past 2 or 3 jobs I applied to have asked me leetcode hard questions which I haven’t studied for at all and I really don’t have the time for outside of what I already do. I live just outside the capital of my state but still my hometown is no tech hub and these aren’t large or well known companies. I understand the value in seeing the results but I feel like isn’t that what my projects on git are for? I just find it hard to work 40 hours a week, work on a side project, and still do things like go on walks with my dog and raise her, cook, clean, workout, general chores and appointments for things like doctors and vaccines and therapy. Not to mention having time for myself and friends so I’m not depressed and lonely. Now they also want me to solve complex coding assignments without time or motivation to do it considering I’m not even getting paid for it. I understand if you want to go to FAANG then sure but I’ve noticed this more and more in the past 5 years from smaller unknown companies.\n\nTrust me I love coding as much as the next guy but I also value me time and friend and family time. I enjoy my job and the coding but after a long day or week the last thing I wanna do is open up a new project and work on code I’m not getting paid for and may not even pay off if they don’t like my solution.\n\nI can understand for companies like FAANG this is a good vetting process and even for new grads maybe that don’t have much experience or projects but after 2 years of experience you really want me to prove myself more? \n\nHonestly I touched on it and I’ll say even side projects are pushing it for me. I do them cause I actually enjoy them and choose projects that interest me but even then I don’t get much time to work on it around my life. I feel like projects are more important if you don’t have a job so that way there isn’t a gap in your coding experience but I think I do a healthy amount of work on my side project given I take good care of myself, have a job and a social life. Though I won’t argue against them too much as I said they are fun, I enjoy coding, and the projects interest me so I can’t complain cause it just helps my resume.\n\nI personally just have been feeling super stressed as I was told for my most recent interview that they would like my solution in a week. I have so much going on now with car troubles, sick dog, my own vaccines and general appointments. I also have a friends birthday party I’ve been planning and don’t want to miss. I told my hiring manager this and he said it’s okay but didn’t seem happy about it. Sucks cause it seems like a nice opportunity but man I probably won’t be able to finish it for at least a month given I only get time on the weekends for now.\n\nSo has anyone else noticed these becoming more common or maybe am I the outlier and just applying to the wrong places? \n\nSorry for the walk of text, like I said this is half rant half curiosity.",

I just completed my Bachelor’s from one of the top 10 schools in the US/world. I had dreams of becoming a doctor for as long as I can remember. I see the current state of things, however, and I just don’t think it’s worth it anymore.\n\nWhat do I mean?\n\nMy eyes have been getting opened to the way POC, especially Black people, are held down in this country since I was young. It gets frustrating, though, when that has to keep happening. I hate how deep it runs. Racism is in everything. We are still fighting for the same things our ancestors fought for years ago. \n\nI don’t want to sound like I’m giving up, but my whole family is finally getting to where I’ve been: It’s so exhausting fighting against the man. It doesn’t matter how much you achieve, it’s still there. To think we are almost to selling our 40-acre haven and just expatriating. Ugh, it just bums me out so bad. I want to cry.\n\nI also think about simple stuff, like how this farm down the road from my house has been in a white family for 7+ generations. That kind of generational wealth doesn’t even happen here. There’s no escaping it.\n\nI don’t hate being Black, but I really wonder. Why? Why have we been handed this deck of cards? It’s hard when people either negate your feelings or tell you to work harder. We do work hard! I constantly am getting taken advantage of for my hard work ethic. I don’t see it bettering the Black situation in the US. I don’t want my whole life to HAVE TO BE fighting for my people’s liberation.

Well during the survey there's this series of questions and as I was explaining the set of questions he cuts me off and says no and says he hasn't been to the doctor in awhile. \n\nSo at the time I took it as he didn't want to answer those set of questions because he hasn't been to the doctor in so long, so for that set of questions I put \"refused\" and my manager asked me why I skipped those questions.

Another husband left the wife and got with someone new, an engagement fell through, and with the successful doctor she ends up having a tumor and she suffers mentally so she decides to leave her relationship. This trend is disturbing to me. Of course we’ve seen this in other shows and movies. The black woman is always alone and has been done wrong. No happiness for the black women in these shows. It portrays a very negative image of black women, that we are somehow incapable of finding healthy love. This makes it difficult sometimes to enjoy a show.

    "text": "Anyone else have a white parent that instilled an inferiority complex in you? Anyone else have a white parent that instilled an inferiority complex in you for being black?\n\nMy white father was a pedophile, who used me as a second partner, and sexualized me my whole life. He fetishized and sexualized black women but saw him self as a good non-racist white man because he married a black woman and didn't care what society or others said. Yeah, my dad was antiracist in some ways because he didn't adhere to societal norms especially being a highly functioning autistic man.. but he definitely had racist ways. He objectified black women and feared black men.  He one drop ruled me and said I was a black woman. When I wanted to embrace my mixed heritage, he would shut it down and make it seem like I was trying to act like I was better. When I was a child, he told me to be careful with white men because many just want the black experience but won't settle down with me. He said not all white men are like himself who don't care about social status, you have to find a white guy who doesn't care like himself. He made it seem like he was one of the only good ones.\n\n In college, I remember one time telling him how a lot of guys including white guys were interested in dating me in the city (contrary to what he told me growing up) and how (unfortunately) due to colorism, my dating experience is not identical to monoracial black women and I have noticed a lot of white men being attracted and wanting to date me seriously. He would shake his head, try to put me in my place, act like I was bragging, and pessimistically tell me I was wrong and that I had similar issues as black women because they saw me as black. He would act like the expert of my experience as though he walked a day in my shoes. He was instilling an Inferiority complex in me for being black. I think he was jealous of these men being interested in me because he wanted me all to himself and was afraid of losing me. I wonder if he purposely chose black women to date because it made him more secure they would not leave because he thought most wouldn't date them of racism and not trying to lower their social status.\n\nI remember one time telling him I wanted to be a Naturopathic doctor but had some fear because not many black/mixed doctors were out there and I would have a harder time finding BIPOC clients and clients in general due to racism. Instead of encouraging me, he agreed with me and tried to discourage me from leaving the state to pursue my dreams. When I said I wanted to act and model in California, he tried to break down my self esteem made me feel like I would not make it--he would often add how my race would make it harder. When I was dating, he became controlling, abusive, called me a whore, that I needed makeup, and I looked bad without makeup. He was getting insecure as I was an adult, ready to leave and date.\n\n Racism is real and there is definitely some truth to what he says about having to be careful around white men and having a harder time in jobs. I do think there was a part of him that was trying to protect me. But there was also a prominent part of him that wanted me all to himself and he used my race to make me feel insecure and Inferior. I've also had my mixed black brother (who also sexualized me) try to make me feel like white men would not want to date me because he got jealous when white men were interested. I think some black/mixed men do this because of their own internalized racism and Inferiority complex.\n\nInstead of discouraging me, my dad should have encouraged me to work harder and preserve despite the obstacles (when I was young he did this but as I got older, he became insecure and started to discourage me for his own selfish needs). He should have told me not all men are the same and there are men of all races who would date me instead of just focusing on the negative racism to make me feel like no one would really consider dating me. He should have let me talk about my mixed black experience instead of denying it and making me feel like I thought I was better for talking about my nuanced mixed black experience.\n\n I used to think he was an example of a non-racist person in my life and I would ask for his advice and support when it came to racism I experienced. Now I see that he was actually very racist, he lied and was a fraud. He was the type of racist white man he warned me about. This has led me to have a skewed/ black &white view of life. His words and of course racist society were traumatic and have left me with an inferiority complex that I am working to deprogram. I realize now the main root cause of my racial trauma and fear of white racism is because of him.",

I'm 25 now, living with my grandma cause of my mom's abusive husband and her codependency issues with him. It's been even worse now ever since I gained weight due to my eating disorder. Ever since highschool, my grandma has always criticized my body and the clothes I wear. I've always been a curvier girl. Thick thighs and bigger breasts. Always been this way. \n\nBack in highschool she would force me to change my clothes and call me names if I wore something she didn't approve of or she'd stare at my chest and lecture me about how I shouldn't wear graphic tees cuz you the graphics are on my chest. Today was another incident of her controling ways. I had a doctor's appointment today so I asked her to take me cause I couldn't get a ride. So I wore some capris and a tee shirt that had a cut out back so my back was exposed. And the capris I wore were form fitting so it clung to my legs but the waist part was too big so I put on a belt to keep them up. As soon as she saw me, her words were \"Those pants are too tight and doesn't fit you and pull your shirt down I see top of your butt.\" Granted they do fit me and you couldn't see that area it was my back she saw. Then she started to lecture me on her views about clothes and how chubby girls shouldn't wear crop tops cuz they don't flatter their bodies n gotta wear clothes that flatter your body. I immediately told her that's your opinion, they like wearing them and feel comfortable in them. She immediately dropped the convo after that. But once I got back into the car from my doctor's office, she gave me another lecture. She stated and I quote \"I understand females of today wear clothes differently but you guys have to remember to stop wearing stuff that shows off your body. You will not get any respect from men cause men are going to think what else she got underneath those tight clothes. Also it's disrespectful to us elders by what you guys wear if it's tight. You have to leave stuff to the imagination us old folks say \" -_- I immediately told her I don't believe that. She's like I get it you don't but I've been alive longer than you and that's how it is. \n\nLet me just say as someone who is a feminist and strongly believes women can wear whatever makes them feel comfortable. I believe women cannot control what a man does. If he choose to look and be a dick,  that's his decision and shows his character. No matter what the women wears it's not her fault for the guys decision. We need to teach our men not to be dicks towards women instead of blaming females for what a man does. \nI'm just getting tired of hearing this crap from her all the time. Today she even made me try on new clothes n see if she deemed them appropriate to wear or not. It's ridiculous. I swear she keeps trying to get me to wear baggy clothes to cover everything. I can't wait to get this job and move out. \nAlso side note, I do not understand why black families keep putting down black females and their bodies. -_-",

My cousin my age and my great-aunt both felt the need to mention how cute their mixed children would be, and how they wouldn't even have to comb their hair.\n\n I have 4c hair. I cut it when I was 12, they put me through hours of painful and tiring hair-styling for years before that. Whenever I grew it out, I ended up cutting it again. First, because I thought I was sorta cute for literally 10 mins, then my mother told me I looked like Fred Douglas. Second, because I told the barber I wanted a shape-up(never again). Third time, because my grandma had texturized it without my consent (I told her no multiple times), to make it \"easier\" for me. I grew it out for a year after the texturizing, and would style it into fros/twists/buns. They still hated it.\n\nAll that, but unborn mostly white kids are cute? Can I never be as beautiful as a white women? /s\n\nMy grandma loves her white son in law. I think she likes him more than she likes me. I lived with them for horrible family reasons, and because my father was living with them. I tried confiding in this man, because he was \"family\", and I was encouraged to by him/grandma. He was so \"supportive\", and grandma just looovvveeeddd him. He even showed me how to use the TV when he saw me struggling with it. Then, I start not being able to find the TV remote. I'm confused, but I figure they wouldn't do that, 'cause it's petty and weird. But, then there's a password. I ask them about it, figuring it's something silly, and they stop making eye contact with me? They start saying that it's their TV, is there something I'd like to watch? I just go to my bed and say goodnight, because it was mad shady. Turns out he decided I should have asked first to use his TV, which, okay, but you were the one to show me how to use it over a month ago, and you've smiled in my face and asked me what I was watching multiple times, so I had no idea you had a problem. He says I can use it, but only after these times, and before then. I say, sure, then I never touch his TV again. This is a public interaction.\n\nOver time, I'm having issues with my father and mental health, because my father doesn't really like having to parent. Even things like taking me to therapy, cut into his time? Since I'm having a hard time keeping it together, I mostly try and keep to myself. That, too, is a problem, apparently its showing I'm unwell (I just don't want to see you all, and even my grandma is encouraging me to stay out of sight). But, my father is talking about how a girl needs her mother,yet again (he never wants to be involved in parenting and complains/neglects often), knowing full well that I literally had to leave. I get upset, and he starts screaming at me and stepping to me,again. I have a panic attack.\n\nThey all agree I'm skipping on my medication, and obviously just schizo (turns out I'm not). I took those meds religiously, hoping they would make me feel better. Now, I have a lot of respect for high-achieving women. But, the women they set me up with to \"help me\", primarily spoke Spanish. One time, I came to her with a side-effect, and her assistant had to translate? I told grandma that this was not working, and I wanted a second opinion that actually listened to me, as she was dismissive of me often, and therefore, I was never able to tell her anything of substance. When they made me sleepy for days on end (everyone saw), he decided to tell me I was having placebo effect? My doctor said no, they do that for real. My aunt told me they did make me feel better, which.... was not true, but she knows more?\n\nBut, she's his colleague, ***it's his house***, and he ***suspect's*** ***I'm not on my medication***. He personally starts monitoring me, and ***I even apologized for being rude*** for being upset. I got kicked out shortly after. I took too much money? My grandma payed rent for me, and my father+uncle+her bought the four of us groceries.I did nothing to these people. \n\nTL;DR  There were outright aggressive comments made, and I would just walk away. I was even called fat, just walk away.\n\nThe rest of my family would stop making eye contact/ literally look away uncomfortably, leaving me to fend for myself. I couldn't even say anything.\n\nEvery.Time. I call my Grandma. She talks about him. She glows holding those babies, being in their presence. She loves me, so much. She has done so much for me. But, like, what am I to her? Her darkest grandchild?\n\nAm I the really the problem, and was this racially motivated?",

    "text": "Pushing Hands (1991): A movie contrasting Confucian tradition with Western Life &#x200B;\n\n[ Sihung Lung as Mr. Chu  and  Deb Snyder as Martha Chu, his daughter-in-law](https://preview.redd.it/y9s3brwjheq61.jpg?width=338&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1169587db08c2da3e0924d70663722bd4675816c)\n\nI watched this movie last night on Amazon Prime. The movie starts with Mr. Chu practicing Taiji Quan in the living room while Martha is sitting rigidly at a computer. After the elderly man finished his routines, he set about making lunch for himself. Since there was no plastic wrap, he covered a bowl in aluminum foil and stuck it in the microwave. The first words that are spoken between them are from the woman who hears the crackling discharge as the foil sparked in reaction to being microwaved.\n\nAfter racing to the kitchen, she pulled the bowl out of the microwave, ripped off the foil, and held it up to Mr. Chu. \"NO METAL\" she snapped. \"NO METAL.\"\n\nThere was no reply. \n\nDuring lunch, Mr. Chu ate from the bowl with chopsticks. The woman ate a completely different meal of vegetables with bread. The meal was eaten in complete silence. \n\nIt took me a while to figure out that Mr. Chu was a retired Taiji Quan Master whose son Alex, had saved money for years in order to bring him to the United States. Martha was Alex's wife. The couple had a son, Jeremy who was played by Haan Lee. \n\n[Mr. Chu smokes outdoors while Martha tries to ignore him by reading a book.](https://preview.redd.it/bma6ybkymeq61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=815d9969732d76cf00d2b68278457a5c4e26cce1)\n\nThis film is about the clash between eastern and western cultural values. Mr. Chu believes in traditional Confucian virtues. He does not speak English and has no interest in learning. Martha is an American novelist who is suffering from writer's block because she finds her father-in-law's presence in their \"cramped home\" distracting. She wants to move into a larger home which would have an in-law suite that would then allow her some degree of privacy while she writes. Although she has picked up a few words of Chinese, she does not speak enough to communicate with her father-in-law. \n\nAs Chinese Americans Alex and and Jeremy straddle both cultures. As a first generation ABC (American born Chinese), Jeremey attends a Chinese language school in an effort by the parents to keep him in touch with his culture. Alex disagrees with his wife about their \"cramped home\" and tells her that in China 4 families could live in a home of this size. He refuses to move because moving would mean that he would have to accept financial assistance from his mother-in-law. \n\nMr. Chu does not think much of American parenting skills. When  Jeremey asks to be excused from dinner, his mother tells him that he may leave after he finishes his milk. The father-in-law observed to his son that American parents think that all interactions with their children are business transactions that have to be negotiated. When Jeremey turns on the TV to watch cartoons, the old man deplores the senseless violence that his grandson is being exposed to. The translated conversation appears as English subtitles. \n\nWhen Martha asked her husband what the father-in-law had said, Alex tactfully mentioned the cartoons but left out any mention of his father's thoughts about American parenting. \n\nWithout saying more, I will simply observe that the characters have been introduced and the tone of the movie has been set. Will the four of these people be able to coexist in their home? If they are not able to live together, what will happen? \n\n[Mr. Chu uses his Taiji Quan skills to teach at the community center. ](https://preview.redd.it/9ll4polmneq61.jpg?width=688&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6327aaf8b15f6a8897b2469e86b477e94536e0b4)\n\nIt was somewhat painful to watch this movie. I'm a sixty year old 3rd generation American and a 1st generation ABC. Watching this movie brought back some bitter sweet memories of visiting my paternal grandparents in California. It also made me think about my relationship with my father. \n\nAlthough my father was the eldest son of his generation, when the time came for someone to take care of his aging parents, he declined to do this. He was employed by the U.S. Public Health Service as a tropical disease specialist and at the time this conversation first came up, he was on TDY (tour of duty) in Bangkok, Thailand. Taking care of his parents would have meant returning stateside to California and possibly ending his career. The responsibility for taking care of the parents fell to his younger brother who was a doctor with the California Public Health Service. \n\nAs with the Chu family in the film, my cousins were raised in a multi-generational home. Since my Uncle's wife was also ethnic Chinese, they were not raised in a biracial home as Jeremey was in the movie. \n\nWhile my grandfather did not practice Taiji Quan, he did meditate. He would sit on the floor in his Tang suit with his limbs cross legged under him and would remain absolutely still with his eyes closed in complete silence. \n\nUnlike Mr. Chu in the movie, my grandfather was a Presbyterian who had been converted to Christianity by American missionaries. My father tells me that when my grandfather caught his wife offering rice to a Buddhist monk,  he seized the monk by his robe and booted him out on the street while yelling in Chinese, \"HALLELUAH, I'M A CHRISTIAN!\" \n\nMy cousins all spoke some Chinese and attended a Chinese language school. They also attended a Chinese American church which offered bilingual sermons. I didn't speak Chinese at all and since my parents wanted me to assimilate into the American culture, they had made the conscious decision to not teach me any Cantonese.\n\nWhile my cousins grew up using chopsticks while eating Chinese food prepared by my grandmother and aunt, I grew up using a fork and a knife to eat American food that my mother made using recipes from a Betty Crocker cookbook. While they ate sticky rice, congee, and bao, I grew up eating spaghetti and meatballs, meatloaf with mashed potatoes, brown gravy, and peas, and pot roast with potatoes, onions, cabbage, and carrots. \n\nMy father has long since deplored the decision to raise me as an American because he thinks that I am much too independent.\n\nIf I were a dutiful son, I would have followed his advice to become a lawyer instead of becoming a teacher. I would have met a woman, married, and given him grandchildren. After he retired, I would have quit my job to move back to California to act as an adult caretaker for my aging parents. I've always wondered about the hypocrisy of this last expectation because my father declined the same request when the time came for him to take care of his parents.",

We all know that without us *expendables* this country would fall apart, as it is already doing. Now is the time to force your way back into this damn country and show them just how useless their entire system is without their *expendables*. No more genital mutilation, no more bullshit laws that keep men as pets, and no more inequality aimed toward us with stupid derogatory terms used to insult us. Alpha male? Sigma male? Beta male?

    "text": "How long will Americans turn a blind eye to circumcision? Let's be straight here, most men circumcised in America aren't religious. There are no proven benefits and only conjectures about circumcision giving defense against HIV which actually falls flat on its face which Africa will soon show us. Condoms are far more effective than cutting off healthy flesh. If you're going to have sex without a condom or a dedicated partner, then it doesn't matter if you're cut or not, because you'll still get HIV.\n\nWomen like to tout that they like the look of a circumcised dick better. That's only when it's flaccid, and that must mean you like tiny dicks. An uncircumcised dick looks far bulkier than a pathetic circumcised dick in the lockerroom where all men are flaccid. It makes me feel so damn inferior. When erect, the foreskin pulls back and looks far more appealing than a circumcised dick. The scar is nasty, the glands are dry, and the color is off. How can anyone prefer that? Many women also prefer sex with uncut men for ease of lubrication and no tearing. Uncut men also don't need to be as rough.\n\nSo, if there's no medical benefit, no cosmetic benefit, and no sexual benefit, then why is it still being done? Profit. American hospitals and doctors are profiting off of cutting your baby boy. They might also be Jewish or religious in a sense, but that doesn't mean they have any right to force their religious laws on others.\n\nThere are also significant risks about circumcision, that your doctor kindly didn't inform you about. Unchecked internal bleeding leading to SIDS. This is a major contributor when you notice that ten times more boys circumcised die of SIDS than their uncircumcised counterparts. Don't even get me started on botched circumcisions that can ruin a man permanently. Cutting off, burning off, taking off too much shaft skin, etc can all lead to a life of humiliation and pain.\n\nLastly, I'd like to point out the psychological, empathy killing, mother destroying side of circumcision. They used to, and sometimes still don't numb the penis before a circumcision. This can cause extreme agony for a child that is tied down and unable to scream for their mother. They wail and wail in agony until they can't fucking cry anymore. This not only gives way to significant violent tendencies and mental health issues later in life, but circumcision has also been linked to mental retardation, probably from blood loss. The extreme pain will absolutely destroy any mother-son relationship, and can lead to mental disorders like autism. This in turn will lead the men to become sociopaths. This damage is permanent, because they were mentally changed and warped at such an early age, without understanding why. This can later lead circumcised men to have a lust for masochistic tendencies. \n\nThe bottom line is that circumcision is not only the molestation of a newborn baby but a complete cash grab that violates people's respect and trust in figures who should be trustable. Doctors make a vow to do no harm, but they only follow such vows if the law deems them required. They'll lie and hold back important information like the complications and damage to watch out for. They say it's just a snip. That's falsified information. I think the mother should have to be in the room to watch the circumcision if she really wants to force that on her child. I wonder how long that would last? In all seriousness, circumcision should be illegal unless the person is of age and wants it. I know many jews that didn't even want to be circumcised. This is a grim violation of our rights, and it's time that men began to show that. We can't just sit here and play dead. Support Foregen and force American hospitals and doctors to pay for it. They fucked us up, so the least they can do is make it right. I shouldn't have to drop 10k$ to fix something that they broke in the first place. Hospitals should also be sued for money for mental healthcare for any circumcised men because boy... do we need it. Even if you don't realize that you were defiled yet, you eventually will. The information is on the net for anyone and America can't censor it. The more you learn about circumcision in published papers, the angrier you get at the AAP and medical system in America as a whole. And I mean... come on... you profit off of millions of us as babies, and you still can't get an affordable healthcare system that works!? Screw off.",

    "text": "The US-funded (in)voluntary male medical circumcision program and its 20 million victims to date. VMMC stands for Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision.\n\nIt is a totally legitimate and totally medical procedure that is obviously done under informed consent. \n\nAccording to research by researchers and governments who legitimately refer to themselves as the \"VMMC community\" in papers, more than 6 million of such totally consensual procedures had been carried out by 2013 with more than 20 millon planned by 2016 and more than 80% of the ones completed by 2013 having been payed for by:\n\n>the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief [PEPFAR]\n\n>The VMMC program is an ambitious public health intervention. While it is estimated that close to 6 million circumcisions had been completed by the end of 2013, against a goal of 20.2 million by 2016, this progress should be viewed within the context of the recent and rapidly developing understanding of the importance of VMMC as an HIV prevention intervention (Figure 1). (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the reason for what researches refer to as \"the VMMC program\" is the belief that circumcision could prevent 60% of female on male HIV contractions without having to provide education on safer sex practices or female and male condoms. Of course, such a program is claimed to be implemented to help the people, but the justification for choosing a method that, as I will show later on, inevitably lead to gruesome human rights violations was to save money. The estimated savings were more than 16 billion in treatment costs with the VMMC program wheighing in at only 2 billion without \"demand creation\" - obviously, the \"created demand\" will be totally voluntary, organic and gras fed:\n\n>Furthermore, the choice to be circumcised involves deep-seated values, beliefs, and motivational factors that vary with ethnic, religious, and cultural identities, and must be addressed effectively to generate demand for circumcision. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/) \n\nOf course, the surgeries are not the only, nor the most effective way to prevent HIV. But with almost 14 Billion in total savings, it is the way to make the most money as VMMC is a one-time procedure that provides \"continuous benefits\" without having to continuously invest into further adherence:\n\n>Modeling studies done in 2009–2011 showed that in these 14 priority countries, achieving 80% circumcision prevalence among males aged 15–49 within five years (“catch-up”), and maintaining this coverage rate in subsequent years (“sustainability”), could avert 3.4 million new HIV infections within 15 years and generate treatment and care savings of US$16.5 billion [7],[8]. **VMMC is a highly cost-effective HIV prevention strategy for both generalized and high-prevalence HIV epidemics [7]. It differs from most other prevention methods (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis, sexual behavior change, or condom use) in that it only requires a one-time action in order to provide continuous benefits.**[...]\n\n>A major limitation of the cost studies in this collection is that they do not include the costs of demand creation nor analyze how increased spending on demand creation might affect the actual demand for services.[...]\n\n>The program faces increasing competition for declining funding for HIV prevention and treatment. The funding need for VMMC remains significant, and continued evidence-based advocacy is necessary to secure funds for accelerated scale-up from a broad base of donors. One way to do this is to evaluate the population-level impact of those VMMC programs that have already been scaled up. Another is to continue to draw comparisons between VMMC and other HIV prevention programs, highlighting specifically that if VMMC coverage reaches the JSAF goal of 80%, it will prove the **most cost-effective and cost-saving HIV prevention intervention** in Eastern and Southern Africa. In addition, it **does not require sustained adherence**, and there is evidence that referrals made from the VMMC program increase HIV-positive males' access to treatment [32].[...] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\nTotally unfortunately though, they are struggling to reach their goals:\n\n>Despite the rapid implementation and scale-up of VMMC programs and the doubling of the cumulative total VMMC procedures in the past year (from 3.2 million by the end of 2012 to an estimated 5.8–6 million by the end of 2013), progress at the country level has varied widely (Figure 3) and the year-on-year rate of growth in the number of VMMCs performed is declining (Figures 2 and ​and 4). This is due to a combination of factors: the JSAF goal of reaching 80% of uncircumcised men by 2016 did not fully take into account country-specific constraints that have tempered the pace of scale-up, **lack of sufficient demand**, and insufficient funding from a broad base of international donors (the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief [PEPFAR] has funded more than 80% of circumcisions to date). Modeling suggests that even if the current growth rate is maintained and adequate funds are forthcoming, the number of VMMCs completed by 2016 would fall about 3 million short of the JSAF goal of 20.2 million (Figure 4). (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\nSo what do you do? What is this \"demand creation\"?\n\nLet's see:\n\n>Demand creation: Messaging must be tailored to different age groups and to the cultural norms of different communities. Men aged 25 and above are less motivated to undergo VMMC. Studies suggest that we need to go beyond simple HIV messaging and present VMMC in terms of hygiene, appearance, attractiveness to partners, peer group norms, and modernity. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\nIn other terms, stigmatize being uncurcumcized as ugly, dirty and unattractive, incite bullying, make them self-conscious and ultimately psychologically break them into totally voluntarily undergoing the ~~assault~~ surgery.\n\nI mean, they totally look at the human and their needs as ~~victims of coercion~~ \"users\":\n\n>While a large portion of this collection focuses on surgical efficiency or quality [9]–[12], the bigger challenge is overall programmatic efficiency. The challenge of scale-up can be approached as a management challenge that requires addressing each element of the delivery value chain (the specific activities that deliver the end product to the user), using time and resources appropriately, and matching supply with demand for VMMC services while working to increase both.[...]\n\n>The cost of circumcision devices and other supply chain costs must be brought down considerably if devices are to reduce overall program costs. This will require advocacy as well as negotiation with manufacturers and suppliers in tandem with demand-creation activities. We recommend further study to ascertain whether devices make circumcision more attractive to men and to understand whether devices could assist with balancing supply and demand to help achieve needed programmatic efficiencies. It is also important to tailor demand-creation activities for devices in order to reach those who may already be aware of circumcision's benefits but who have avoided conventional surgical methods.[...]\n\n>To date little research has looked at the male population as a market of consumers of an intervention with multiple benefits. A market research approach, along with insights from diverse fields such as behavioral economics and anthropology, can provide new tools to inform the development of new approaches. More funding should be allocated to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the many approaches to creating and mobilizing demand. Those that show positive results should be taken to scale. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\nBy now, by the way, we are in the next stage and already target boys down to the age of 10 (and below, as I will show later on): \n\n>It is important to begin strategizing for the sustainability phase that should follow the present “catch-up” activities. It will take time to determine the best approach to sustaining high MC prevalence in each country, develop global and national frameworks, secure resources, and implement long-term programs. Since the cohorts prioritized in the sustainability phase will likely be some combination of uncircumcised boys (aged 10−14 years) and infants (aged 0−60 days), it will also be important to explore how best to reach young adolescents and parents of infants, taking into account impact, cost, the feasibility of scale-up, cultural acceptability, and other factors. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011573/)\n\nSo let's look at some actual approaches for ~~coercing~~ promoting ~~mutilation~~ demand.\n\n>Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) programs in Africa have significantly altered social norms related to male circumcision among previously non-circumcising groups and groups that have practiced traditional (non-medical) circumcision. One consequence of this change is the stigmatization of males who, for whatever reason, remain uncircumcised. This paper discusses the ethics of stigma with regard to uncircumcised adolescent males in global VMMC programs, particularly in certain recruitment, demand creation and social norm interventions. Grounded in our own experiences gained while conducting HIV-related ethics research with adolescents in Kenya, we argue that use of explicit or implicit stigma to increase the number of VMMC volunteers is unethical from a public health ethics perspective, particularly in campaigns that leverage social norms of masculinity. (https://academic.oup.com/phe/article-abstract/14/1/79/6134846)\n\n>The objective of this study was to explore norms of masculinity and the decision-making process among Luo young men to provide a better understanding of how circumcision and masculinity relate to cultural norms within this community. The methodology consisted of eight FGDs with male peer groups and 24 in-depth interviews to elicit young men's perceptions of masculinity and voluntary medical male circumcision. Findings from thematic analysis reveal that young men described several key characteristics of masculinity including responsibility, bravery and sexual attractiveness. For some young men, voluntary medical male circumcision has embedded itself into cultural norms of masculinity by being a step in the transition from boyhood to manhood and by being a marker of some of these masculine characteristics. In the case of voluntary medical male circumcision, there may be opportunities to integrate other programming that helps men transition into healthy adulthood.(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345920045_Integration_of_voluntary_male_medical_circumcision_for_HIV_prevention_into_norms_of_masculinity_findings_from_Kisumu_Kenya)\n\n>There is a need to identify key barriers and facilitators to VMMC uptake in priority countries to improve uptake. In this paper, we report findings from a systematic review of the barriers and facilitators of VMMC uptake, comparing them across countries in order to provide programmers critical information to design effective VMMC uptake interventions. Our review followed PRISMA protocol. Twenty three articles from 10 of the 14 priority countries were included. The top three barriers cited were: MC negatively perceived as being practiced by other or foreign cultures and religions, fear of pain caused by the procedure, and perceptions of VMMC as not helpful/needed. The top four facilitators cited in most countries were: Belief that VMMC reduces health risks and improves hygiene, family and peer support of MC, and enhanced sexual performance and satisfaction.(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324780087_Systematic_review_of_barriers_and_facilitators_to_voluntary_medical_male_circumcision_in_priority_countries_and_programmatic_implications_for_service_uptake)\n\nNote that \"peer support\" and \"peer educators\" are very euphemistic terms, given what they actually describe:\n\n>Many circumcised respondents, especially the younger men, relayed stories of peer-influence in their decision to get circumcised:\n>\"*There was a friend of mine who had decided to go for circumcision and told me, ‘Let’s go and circumcise. How can we continue like this and let other people ridicule us?’ The fear of ridicule from age-mates [already circumcised] influenced our decision.*\" (Circumcised man, age 35)\n>Similarly, some uncircumcised men in the more peri-urban areas, said they would be more likely to “go for the cut” if their peers had been circumcised. [...] Social network influences on VMMC uptake are relatively unexplored [28], although the use of peer educators is widespread in VMMC programming. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011674/)\n\nStudies with these populations have exposed numerous problems, for example the fact that the ~~victims~~ \"clients\" have to be turned in by certain groups of \"mobilizers\" and \"peer educators\" for them to collect money that was put on their heads:\n\n>For mobilizers especially, monthly remuneration (and their future employment) depends on referring enough clients to the clinic each week; failing means earning less, regardless of the amount of time and effort invested in mobilization. From our interviews we learned that while most mobilization supervisors receive a base salary from their IPs regardless of the targets, other lower-level, subcontracted “associate” mobilizers or “peer educators” only receive payment by providing clients and meeting targets. [...]. (This and following quotes without links are from here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337027391_Voluntary_medical_male_circumcision_for_HIV_prevention_among_adolescents_in_Kenya_Unintended_consequences_of_pursuing_service-delivery_targets)\n\nOne mobilization supervisor said:\n\n>And you know, when there are zero clients cut, all the pressure comes to the mobilization supervisor because the surgeons will be saying, ‘We are ready to cut, where are the clients?’ So the buck stops on me as the mobilizer; so it is not a very easy task.\n\nAnother:\n\n>Likewise, a 30-year-old, female mobilization supervisor offered, “We bank on schools so much. And now, when they are taking their exams, you can’t pick a child from school [. . ..] . . .when schools are so engaged, then definitely I will not meet that target” [Mobilizer 4].\n\nThe pressure to meet targets leads to numerous ways of coercing, pushing or otherwise making people undergo the procedure:\n\n>Data collected during interviews and observations suggest that the drive to meet targets may lead some VMMC mobilizers to use misleading or otherwise questionable mobilization practices to increase the number of adolescents they can refer for circumcision. As Mobilizer 1 explained: \"*Another thing is the peer mobilizers, yeah, someone wants to meet his or her targets and that is the time that they engage in what I called the uncouth methods, whereby the end justifies the means; whichever means that can make those clients come out. So you end up having the clients coming, but they are not coming for the VMMC the way we want it. They have been pushed; they have been coerced. . .yeah. This one is happening because of these targets. So that is the downside of the targets.*\" These practices are sometimes blatant: during one door-to-door village mobilization, the mobilizer kept referring to himself as “doctor” although he had no medical training. Another mobilizer, a 38-year-old male who referred to himself as a “VMMC champion” explained how he pays boys to help him mobilize their friends: \"*For us we are calling it ‘broking [brokering] system’. So after the exercise, you tell him to go. . . and convince a friend and bring a friend. . . [. . .]. For me I am using my own system being that we are not even allowed to give children money. But for me, because I have a target, and if I get my target, I am expecting 10800 KES [108 USD]. So I do divide this 10800 KES; maybe if he brings me two boys, I can give him up to 50 KES. I can even give out 100 KES [1 USD]. The moment I give that money, 50 bob, to that boy, he is going to bring me more four boys. So the more he bring boys for instance if they are four, I give 100–150 KES. At the end of the day, I will hit my target*\" [Mobilizer 5].\n\nThey also perform skits in which they try to stigmatize foreskin:\n\n>Other times, these practices are subtle and easy to overlook. During a promotional skit in which mobilizers played the roles of a husband, wife, and brother all discussing VMMC, the message to the audience was one of strong female preference for circumcised men. The wife told her husband, “Go and cut your firimbi [whistle] . . . go and remove that sleeve of a sweater. That whistle is not going inside me. . .don’t blow the whistle inside me. I have refused. . .. I am not giving you [sex].” Later, when the husband’s brother arrived, he explained that his wife is refusing to have sex. In response, his brother said, “I was passing here to tell you to go for circumcision. Look at me, I have gone, and I am fine. I am now a clean person.” Explaining the benefits, his brother offered that MC reduces HIV risk by 60% and enhances cleanliness (“you avoid smelling”) and prevents cervical cancer.\n\nThat being said, I want to explicitly distance myself from the author's statements claiming this to be \"subtle\" and even framing it as merely \"unbalanced humor\" later on:\n\n>While we recognize that the promotional skits used during VMMC “roadshows” use humor and dramatize promotional messages to accentuate the positive, greater efforts should be made to ensure that this messaging is balanced so that benefits and risks are neither over- or understated. For similar reasons, the practice of public health workers persuading boys to become circumcised by claiming that their future female partners will definitely prefer them that way (and reject them if they are not) [45] should be questioned if not discouraged.\n\nI strongly disagree. As long as uncircumcised men are in any way stigmatized, the resulting willingness to undergo such a prcedure may not actually be based on personal preferences rather than an attempt to avoid social sanctions. In fact, the abovementioned alterations of social norms may act as a coercive force even if these practices were completely abandoned, let alone only \"balanced\". It doesn't surprise me though, given that according to netflix, telling men with small dicks to go kill themselves already is \"balanced humor\". Outsourcing the coercion to peers does not change the inherent conflicts associated with not wanting to get circumcised whilst not wanting to get bullied or even attacked for being incorrectly held responsible for all HIV infections that will inevitably occur until education and supply of proper prevention methods is ensured.  You can stop claiming to be a doctor, you can stop using material incentives to persuade those who are easy to manipulate - but you can't just revert the social changes and misinformation (as shown later: only uncircumcised men contract HIV; the only prevention method is circumcision) which induce the creation of pressure by people whom you have no control over. The damage is done and may be irreversible. \n\nAnother way of coercion is paying them with food and clothing:\n\n>According to interviewees, food, money, water, sanitation, clothing, and other basic needs are issues of concern for many adolescents’ households. During health talks, some mobilizers emphasized the incentives that boys will receive (e.g., sodas and/or new underwear) following circumcision—items that may be significant inducements among impoverished children. During a village mobilization effort, one mother explained her reluctance to let her son be circumcised: “. . .*this one is small. Even his heart was there because those who have come from circumcision are ‘seducing’ their friends to go also. They are telling them, ‘go and it is not painful.’* [OP: Remember boys are paid to seduce their friends.]  *They are also giving people sodas. So that soda is what brings them nearer. I told this boy not to sneak, but to wait and I will take him there*. . ..” Offering a similar analysis, Provider 3 told us: \"*Sometimes they also entice them for us; in the facility we give them a bottle of soda, Fanta to be specific because one, some of the boys come probably from poor families, they haven’t had a meal in the morning or breakfast and sometimes stay in the clinic for more than two hours, three hours and thus to maintain their sugars. [But] that one [soda] becomes a bait, especially for the young ones ‘We will give you a soda; we pick you with a vehicle’ . . .which is actually wrong because, it is like enticing a client which you are not supposed to, but that is how they [mobilizers] ply their trade.*\" However, according to our interviewees and as we observed first hand, clinics sometimes lack sodas and/or underwear to give to clients.\n\nA common theme here is the incitation of social stigma and peer pressure:\n\n>All six of the teachers we interviewed recognized social pressure as a primary motivator for MC among adolescents. During observations of mobilization activities, we saw firsthand how mobilizers sometimes make use of or encourage peer pressure to promote circumcision, including through the use of abusive and/or stigmatizing language. During a health talk in front of a large group of boys at a primary school, one male mobilizer referred to foreskins as the “sleeve of a sweater” and “cold matumbo” [boiled goat intestines]; at the end of the talk, he implored those who still had their “whistles” to have them removed. He also told them: “Those who are still having the foreskin, you are the ones who are going to spread the diseases. In the future, you are the ones who are going to spread the HIV virus.” Later that same day, the mobilizer asked a large group of older students,“How many of you wish to get the HIV virus? If you don’t want to get the HIV virus, the only option is to remove the foreskin.” Revealing his awareness of this type of language and messaging within VMMC mobilization, Provider 3 explained: \"*This is demeaning and they try to create some peer pressure. Like when you go to those mass cuts in high schools, probably they registered like 100 clients, you would likely get another probably 30 or so who, because of the peer pressure, just jump into it. But if it was like walking from home to hospital and demanding for the service, they are not likely to have gone. But now that it is here, and so and so has gone and is my friend, I have to be in it.*\"\n\nUnfortunately, the quality of the provided \"surgery\" is lacking as well:\n\n>Under pressure to meet targets, some Clinical Officers and other VMMC medical staff find ways to speed up the clinical process. For example, as we were told during interviews and observed firsthand at multiple VMMC facilities, providers may opt not to take patient medical histories or conduct preoperative examinations (e.g., blood pressure, weight, preexisting conditions, etc.) and/or 30-minute post-operative check-ins, and yet fill in the requisite forms as if these activities had been completed. Other avenues for time-saving include rushing circumcisions, inadequate stitching, splitting surgical utensil and bandage packs between patients, not following recommended protocols or procedures (e.g., the dorsal slit method for circumcision), and stacking patients one after another with little pause in between, which raises additional sanitary and privacy concerns. According to an experienced VMMC surgeon: \"*We cut a lot of corners and I will give you an example: [. . .] so because of speed, you find that while one client is dressing [after circumcision], the other one is [already] undressing. Ideally, it is supposed [to be] that you finish with this client, you give [them] instructions on how to take medication and all that, but because of the high volume, you find that some of us we are not the ones giving out the medication. We assign somebody randomly, you know, who will be giving out the medication and the refreshment and so [the] information [they provide to the client] may not be correct. [. . ..] Sometimes even the vitals of post-operation 30 minutes after [circumcision] are not done. It is skipped, or somebody else does [it]—probably a receptionist who is nonmedical, just to fulfill the requirements of the form. [This] is wrong because you are supposed to do the circumcision and the client rests for 30 minutes in a bed or a couch, then after that, you do the vitals then you discharge. Oh, even the wound care instructions, [that] information may not sink in for the client because it is presented so fast and there may not be [time] for questions. Yeah, there are so many corners we cut. [. . ..] . . .at a clinic last year, I saw them hold that yellow form [medical files] and going through [and just] check, check, check. . . adding blood pressure, adding all these things, just filling them in [without actually measuring blood pressure, etc.]*\". [Provider 3]. One assistant surgeon, a 25-year-old female nurse, claimed her record time for completing a circumcision was six minutes. She too associated VMMC targets with client overload, and with rushing surgeries and an increase in adverse events. She explained: \"*Sometimes you compete cutting clients and the clients are too much. The average time for a client’s [circumcision] is between 12 to 20 minutes. So when the clients are too much, and you want to meet your targets, you will perform the surgery a bit fast. So upon that you will have [an] adverse event and maybe a child will come back with a bleeder [an oozing artery or other blood vessel] you did not close [suture] well*\" [Provider 4].\n\nAnd finally, the guidelines to not accept boys under the age of 10 are regularily ignored:\n\n>Current VMMC for HIV prevention guidelines and national protocols approved for use in Kenya require that adolescent clients must be at least ten years of age.[16] Despite this directive, interviews and observations confirmed that VMMC staff sometimes mobilize and circumcise boys who are under ten years of age in order to boost their numbers to meet targets. When asked about potential links between targets, mobilizer strategies, and underage circumcision, Provider 3 offered: \"*Yes, they bend the rules. . . because you know sometimes our current age according to WHO is 10 years and above. But when they [mobilizers] go to the field and get a nine-year-old for example, they coach this client and the parent, because we insist on seeing the con-sent. We always insist they put the ID and telephone number of the parent [on the consent form]. When they come to the facility, we [call to] confirm the age and whether the parent has consented for the child to be circumcised. And you know, they will tell you ‘yes I am 10 years old’, but when you look at the guy, he is probably 8 or. . .*\" . We observed evidence for the mobilization of underage boys at ten of the 14 VMMC facilities we visited for observation, including boys (and their mobilizers) who readily admitted that they were underage.\n\nThese findings are in line with other research, showing that consent is undervalued and that uncircumcised men report higher rates of depression and a lower quality of life - which you are free to attribute to anything but the incitation of stigma, if you like:\n\n>We identify gaps in the consent process and poor psychosocial outcomes among a key target group: male adolescents. We assessed compliance with consent and assent requirements for VMMC in western Kenya among males aged 15–19 (N = 1939). We also examined differences in quality of life, depression, and anticipated HIV stigma between uncircumcised and circumcised adolescents. A substantial proportion reported receiving VMMC services as minors without parent/guardian consent. In addition, uncircumcised males were significantly more likely than their circumcised peers to have poor quality of life and symptoms of depression. (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334897740_Consent_Challenges_and_Psychosocial_Distress_in_the_Scale-up_of_Voluntary_Medical_Male_Circumcision_Among_Adolescents_in_Western_Kenya)\n\nOthers have questioned the way the 60% figure is used as well as understood by patients (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261870976_The_ethics_of_claiming_a_60_reduction_in_HIV_acquisition_from_voluntary_medical_male_circumcision).\n\nBy december 2019, about 19 million boys and men had been victimized:\n\n>To date, the U.S. President’s Emergency\nPlan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has supported nearly 19 million VMMCs to protect men and boys\nin east and southern Africa. (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338220761_Guide_on_High-Impact_Practices_to_Create_Demand_for_Voluntary_Medical_Male_Circumcision_Services)\n\nWith other sources claiming it to have been 23 million in 2018 already (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344199074_A_New_Tuskegee_Unethical_Human_Experimentation_and_Western_Neocolonialism_in_the_Mass_Circumcision_of_African_Men).\n\nGuides have stressed the importance of encouraging \"peer-to-peer demand creation\" (which is of course not bullying, nor mobilizers hiring hitboys to \"bring them boys\" for cash, as we know...), setting targets to boost performance (well...), recruiting exclusively satisfied patients to \"dispell myths\" (which unsatisfied patients can't, apparently) and to promote and integrate the program into highly misandristic traditions of mutilation as an initiation to becoming a  \"man\" (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338220761_Guide_on_High-Impact_Practices_to_Create_Demand_for_Voluntary_Medical_Male_Circumcision_Services) - beliefs akin to those that have resulted in some of the most barbaric traditions around public displayals of forced sexual torture (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324477813_Forced_male_circumcision_and_the_politics_of_foreskin_in_Kenya).\n\nIn the end, it is undeniable that the \"voluntary\" in VMMC was a naive ideal at best, and a lie at worst. Other ways to address the issue were present: Education on safer sex practices and rarely known devices that are accessible to couples in which the man has penile (surgery) scars, lower erectile performance or other variations in shape and anatomy of their primary genitalia - such as female condoms, as well as the distribution of such devices are just one example. After all, if these misguided attempts wouldn't have changed societal norms and stigma to a state that makes it practically impossible to differentiate between choice and coercion, nobody would stop anyone from providing accurate information on and a safe execution of voluntary circumcisions.",

    "text": "Some common gender myths and their rebuttals It seems like the same discussions come up around Reddit a lot, so I figured I'd gather up some common topics, and their rebuttals.\n\nMany of these arguments can be expanded with more points and sources but I'm trying to keep this as compact and to the point as possible.\n\n####Myth 1: \"Sexism against men is never institutional or systematic\"\n\nMany forms of sexism and discrimination against men are *explicitly* institutionalized or systemic in society.\n\nExamples include police violence, court biases, incarceration, child custody discrimination, military service, educational biases, health research and spending, insurance, housing discrimination, reproductive rights, bodily autonomy rights, and many others.\n\nThe widespread ignorance and denialism around these issues can itself be interpreted as a form of systemic discrimination against men as well.\n\nNote that some of these are institutional because they boil down to statutory legal rights which exist in the realm of government policy and administration.  And the government is obviously an institution.\n\n#### Myth 2: \"Most politicians and CEOs are men, and this has led to a society that privileges men and disenfranchises women\"\n\nThe fact that many positions of formal power are occupied by men does not translate into measurable privileges for the average man.\n\nThe assumption this is based on is the idea that men have an in-group bias and prefer other men over women.\n\nWhich is an idea that has been debunked over and over again in the academic literature.  The gender bias among men is almost zero, and sometimes manifests as an out-group bias sightly in favor of women, not other men.\n\nIn-group bisses do exist among women though.  In fact some research has found evidence for very strong gender biases among women.  Including when it comes to educators, bosses, and hiring managers.  Women in formal positions of power do actually seem to prefer other women over men, in much the same way that men are accused of behaving. So maybe this is just projection: people who themselves have gender biases assume that everyone else does as well.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15491274\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103101915112\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_9\n\n####Myth 3: \"Women were uniquely oppressed in history compared to men\"\n\nMuch like today, sexism in history was often two sides of the same coin.  If it was unfair that women had to stay home and take care of their children then it was also unfair that men had to work long hours outside the comfort of their homes.  Many people try to equate sexism to the history of racism, as if men were unilaterally oppressing women for their own benefit. And that's simply not an accurate view of history (nor is it a very healthy belief to have).  \n\nGender norms were often unfair to women. But for most of history, women could own property, get divorced (where they usually took most of their husband's money), run businesses, and even be heads of state.  Many large empires were ran by women, for example.\n\nThe reality of the situation though is that pregnancy (and breastfeeding) often dictated the need for women to have men supporting them. Birth control and baby formula didn't exist. So your options were basically abstinence, or marriage. Which was the same choice that men also had.\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books/about/The_Privileged_Sex.html?id=4szznAEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description\n\nhttps://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download_file?file_format=application/pdf&safe_filename=Item.pdf&type_of_work=Journal%20article\n\nhttps://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199582174.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199582174-e-036\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/legalsubjection00baxgoog/\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/beard/woman-force/index.htm\n\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1855/f217b082603d0ab37ea80c4741fceb8a4a23.pdf\n\n**\"What about voting rights?\"**\n\nVoting rights were historically tied to military service and the draft. It was never something that men got \"for free\" just for being men.\n\nIn England, most men couldn't vote until 1918, and that was only because they instituted a draft for all men during WWI.\n\nWomen aged 30 and older were also given the right to vote in 1918, and this came without the same obligation to serve in the military that men had.  Women over 21 were given voting rights just 10 years later in 1928, which was the same age that men could vote.  And that temporary age difference had a practical purposes: so many men died in WW1 that there was a need to even out the gender ratio.\n\nSo men have been allowed to vote for a whopping 10 years longer than women, *at most*.  And that was only because of the mass, involuntary slaughter that they experienced around the world during WW1.\n\nOther obligations that men had were paying taxes, attending caucuses, and signing up for bucket bridges to fight fires.\n\nIt took a few decades in some parts of the world for people to decide that it was fair for women to be able to vote without giving anything back to the state, but I think it's important to understand the context here. It wasn't misogyny or oppression but political theory.  Specifically the question of whether or not it was fair to give women voting rights without equivalent responsibilities that were required from men (something known as a [moral hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard), and that can be contextualized as *\"female privilege also sometimes harming women\"*).\n\nhttps://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/womenvote/parliamentary-collections/collections-the-vote-and-after/representation-of-the-people-act-1918/\n\nhttp://www.familyofmen.com/when-did-men-and-women-have-the-right-to-vote-in-canada/\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/iu2ebj/women_could_and_did_own_property_and_have_rights/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/l1byes/suffrage_was_primarily_a_class_issue_not_a_gender/\n\n####Myth 4: \"Domestic violence and sexual assault are primarily women's issues\"\n\nDomestic violence and sexual assault affects everyone, and at nearly identical rates between men and women.\n\nIn the US, roughly 37.3% of women have been victims of domestic violence, stalking, sexual harassment, and sexual abuse.  Including 1.4 million women who experience sexual assault annually.\n\nFor men that same figure is 30.9%. Including 1.7 million men who experience sexually assault annually (defined as \"made to penetrate\").  The vast majority of these men are also victimized by women, not by \"other men\" (which is another myth).\n\nThis pattern is similar across the world, including in poor and underdeveloped nations (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/koinom/some_sources_on_the_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys/) for a collection of studies), and is consistent with a wide range of research demonstrating \"gender parity\" between men and women for this topic.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf\n\nhttp://webshare.law.ucla.edu/Faculty/bibs/stemple/Stemple-SexualVictimizationPerpetratedFinal.pdf\n\nhttps://1in6.org\n\nIt's also not true that there's a significant difference in severity between male and female victims.  Around 66% of intimate partner homicides do have women as victims (which is hardly a staggering majority), but when you include intimate partner related suicide deaths (including assisted suicides), a greater number of men are killed because of domestic violence than women.  These statistic also ignore the fact that lesbian relationships are more violent than heterosexual and gay male relationships.  Which inflates these numbers and doesn't necessarily back up the idea that women are being uniquely victimized by men.\n\nWe should obviously work to fight against abuse in any form, but our current, gendered approach to this doesn't seem to be helping very much.  It is also commonly used as an excuse for misandry.  Many people who discuss abuse against women do not actually care about female victims.  All they care about is advancing a culture of hatred and sexism against men.\n\nhttps://web.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/assault.htm\n\nhttps://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.5042/jacpr.2010.0141/full/html\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01506/full\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/f4rvop/some_sources_on_the_severity_of_domestic_violence/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/koinom/some_sources_on_the_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/f5tes5/gender_parity_for_sexual_assault_academic_studies/\n\n**\"But women are afraid to walk down dark alleyways at night!\"**\n\nAs they should.  And as do men.  Most violent crime targets men. And fear is subjective. This is hardly evidence of some kind of unique oppression against women (at least one that doesn't also affect men), and it ignores the fact that men are usually afraid of finding themselves in those same situations as well.\n\nMen are stronger and more capable of defending themselves so I wouldn't blame someone for having gendered views or assumptions here.  But let's try not to minimize male victimization or blame it on things like \"male oppression\".\n\n####Myth 5: \"False allegations are extremely rare\"\n\nMultiple studies have found alarmingly high rates of false allegations in society.\n\nAs many as 1 in 7 men have been falsely accused at some point in their life, and they often have to live with those allegations even after proving their innocence.\n\nIn addition, around 1 in 20 women have also been falsely accused at some point during their life.\n\nFalse allegations are particularly common when it comes to child custody and divorce, where well over half of all allegations have been estimated to be false.  There is also a common racial element that targets minority men.  Especially in history during the era of lynchings in the US.\n\nhttp://www.saveservices.org/dv/falsely-accused/survey/\n\n http://www.prosecutorintegrity.org/pr/survey-over-20-million-have-been-falsely-accused-of-abuse/\n\nhttps://quillette.com/2019/04/16/divorce-and-the-silver-bullet/\n\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/files/14977/14977-h/14977-h.htm\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/e6w4yc/i_call_bullshit_on_the_false_rape_accusation/\n\n####Myth 6: \"Men commit suicide more often than women, but women still *attempt* suicide more often than men\"\n\nThis idea has its origins with faulty hospital reporting which lumps suicide attempts in with self-harm (which is something that's more common among women).  Women are also more likely to report their suicide attempts than men. And even if this statistic were accurate, it ignores the obvious fact that a suicide survivor can attempt again, thus artificially inflating this statistic.\n\nThe fact is, most suicid deaths are men, and most evidence points to there being more unique attempts by men. Any evidence that men are \"better\" at it than women has been interpreted as evidence for greater motivation of success, due to the very same factors that lead them to attempt suicide to begin with. Not as evidence that women are somehow attempting suicide at rates similar to men in the background.\n\nhttps://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1398-8\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/cvpyve/comment/ey5xeda\n\n####Myth 7: \"Men make more money because of their gender, and this is evidence of male privilege\"\n\nExisting gender norms encourage men to earn money in order to meet the financial demands that are placed on them by women.\n\nThis causes them to work harder and sacrifice more for their careers than women. Which they do in part because their income is tied to how successful they are with women, and whether or not they qualify as \"marriage material\".\n\nThe wage gap is therefore an example of a gender norm that harms men just as much as it does women.\n\n92% of workplace deaths are men. Men work on average an extra 4 to 10 hours a week (depending on your source) than women. They start working at a younger age (often skirting child labor laws). They retire later (which is also during their peak earning years). And they die sooner than women. Men have worse health outcomes than women and that's largely because of the pressures that society puts on them to be successful and earn money to spend on women.\n\nThis is the other side of the wage gap that is equally as important, and that is equally as harmfully to men as it is to women. And it's really just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIn many ways the wage gap is just a reflection of the financial exploitation of men in society.  Which is facilitated by things like hypergamy and unfair marriage and divorce practices.\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/kzvfcg/about_the_wage_gap/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/dxaimc/the_wage_gap_is_created_by_women_and_reflects/\n\n####Myth 8: \"Men don't go to the doctor because of toxic masculinity\"\n\nThe main reason that men sometimes don't seek help is a lack of time to see a doctor.\n\nMen work longer hours than women at jobs that are less flexible, and more stressful, than jobs that women usually work at. [Men overall engage in an extra hour of paid and unpaid labor per day compared to women](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/ft_18-05-01_fathersday_time/), and an extra 45 minutes commuting to jobs that are further away. Meaning men on average have quite a bit less free time to go see a doctor than women do.\n\nThis is also something that changes during retirement: retired men are just as likely to go to the doctor as retired women.\n\nhttps://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e003320\n\nA general lack of help and support, especially financial support, for men who need medical help also contributes to this.  There is a myth that men are better taken care of than women which has resulted in gendered policies that help women, but exclude men.  Even though it's men who often need that help more.\n\n####Myth 9: \"Men don't speak up about sexism as much as women, so it's obviously not as big of an issue\"\n\nThis is because people are less likely to care or listen to them. In part because many men who do speak up are silenced and accused of being misogynistic. A situation known as testimonial injustice or [epistemic oppression](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-epistemic-oppression/).\n\nMen are told to keep quiet and many end up internalizing the idea that only women can be discriminated against, since this is what society tells us to believe.  Instead, men often adopt different terminology when they discuss gender issues.  Like referring to differences in treatment between men and women as \"double standards\" instead of sexism or discrimination.\n\n####Myth 10: \"Most men's issues are caused by men themselves\"\n\nMost men's issues are caused by gender norms and those gender norms are enforced by women just as much as they are by men.\n\nMen's issues are often just one side of the coin, and usually reflect disadvantages that women face as well.\n\nOne of the biggest gender norms in society is hypergamy, or the tendency for women to try to marry up, and for men to marry down.  And this gender norm is mostly enforced by women, not by men.\n\nTwo other gender norm that are enforced by women is the providership gender norm, and the childcare gender norm. Which also causes women to perform more unpaid work and earn less money than men in the labor market.\n\nA fourth gender norm that is enforced by women more than men is the \"boys don't cry bias\". Which is mainly instilled in young boys by their mothers and by female school teachers.  In fact, fathers and male school teachers actually fight against this gender norm.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053535711000321\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/04/messages-of-shame-are-organized-around-gender/275322/\n\nhttps://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/09/24/chapter-1-public-views-on-marria\n\nhttps://scholar.harvard.edu/files/akillewald/files/money_work_and_marital_stability.pdf\n\nhttps://www.fatherhood.org/fatherhood/maternal-gatekeeping-why-it-matters-for-children\n\nhttps://news.uoguelph.ca/2019/11/mothers-push-gender-stereotypes-more-than-fathers-study-reveals/\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/gjtj10/most_people_regardless_of_gender_prefer_to_stay/\n\n####Myth 11: \"Toxic masculinity is harming men and their mental health\"\n\nThe concept of toxic masculinity has never been empirically tested, and some research questions the validity of it in the context of psychology and mental health.\n\nEven if you do think it is valid though, it is still commonly used in a way that is sexist and hateful torwards men.\n\nIn recent years it has become associated with female supremacy, feminist hostility towards men, and misandry in general.  And as a result, the vast majority of men find the term to be sexist and offensive.\n\nMen who identify with traditional masculine values have greater self-esteem, better mental health, better relationships with women, and are usually better educated than men who are opposed to masculinity or who accept feminist views about the patriarchy and toxic masculinity.\n\nThe key to better mental health for men might therefore be an embracement of masculinity, not a shunning of it.  Instead of trying to redefine masculinity, we should work to understand it better, and offer men better services based on an honest acknowledgement that men's and women's mental health might require different approaches.\n\nMen are not \"defective women\", and treating men's mental health in that context does not seem to be working very well.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/apa-guidelines-men-boys.html\n\nhttps://zenodo.org/record/3871217#.X-p1ji2l2J_\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_5\n\n####Myth 12: \"Most men's activists just hate women or are opposed to feminism.  They don't really care about men.\"\n\nThis rhetoric is normally used to silence the voices of men (and women) who support men's rights and prevent them from expressing themselves.  Which makes it another example of testimonial injustice or epistemic oppression.\n\nThe fact is that many people do care about men's issues, and that's why they become MRAs.  Feminism does get discussed in the men's movement, but there are a couple reasons for that:\n\n1. Many feminists, \"radical\" or otherwise, have advocated against men and have even pushed for public policy in ways that are harmful to men or discriminates against men. Feminists themselves tend to not fight against this, meaning it's often up to MRAs to address it.\n\n2. Many MRAs are themselves current or ex-feminists who were ostracized for daring to take the feminist rhetoric about *\"also caring about men\"* a little too seriously.\n\nWarren Farrell is a great example of this. He used to be on the board of directors for NOW, the world's largest feminist organization.\n\nAnd then he said that we need to work on child custody equality and reproductive rights for men. Topics that he assumed should fall under the umbrella of feminism since they are issues pertaining to gender equality.  Instead of agreeing with him though, he ended up being excommunicated from the feminist movement. And now he's often regarded as the \"father of the modern men's movement\" for carrying on his advocacy outside of feminism.\n\nThe problem that many MRAs have with feminism is that it usually stops half way when advocating for gender equality.\n\nSo sometimes what MRAs are doing is just taking it the rest of the way towards actual gender equality. Our frustration with feminists comes from the fact that they refuse to see this as valid (or do it themselves to begin with).\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ihmb2p/by_denying_that_the_feminist_establishment_is/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/9v6tqj/a_list_about_feminism_misandry_for_anyone_who/\n\n####Myth 13: \"Men don't receive custody of their children because they're bad fathers and don't bother requesting custody\"\n\nAcademic research simply does not back this up.  [The only study that ever found something like this was discovered to be purposefully fraudulent](http://www.breakingthescience.org/SJC_GBC_analysis_intro.php), although that hasn't stopped people from trying to repeat this. The fact is that men are widely discriminated against on numerous different fronts when it comes to child custody and other areas involving family court law.  \n\nNote also how hateful this rhetoric is.  This is the kind of stuff that you find repeated by feminists, and it simply doesn't treat this topic in a fair and honest manner.  Fathers love their children and many fight tooth and nail just to get a few hours a week to spend with them. The system is broken and it represents a grave social injustice that is deeply unfair to fathers and their children.\n\nhttps://www.sharedparenting.org/2019-shared-parenting-report\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ilzceq/cmv_equal_child_custody_for_mothers_and_fathers/\n\n####Myth 14: \"Most child abusers are men\"\n\nA majority of child abuse is actually committed by women, and especially by mothers.  This is even more true when you include emotional abuse and neglect instead of just physical abuse.\n\nBy some metrics, the biological father is the safest person for a child to be with. This is because when men do abuse children, it often happens while under the custody of the mother.  Who is sometimes complicit in the abuse or even encourages it.\n\nClose to half of child abductors and traffickers are also women, not men.  And many of their victims are boys.  Boys face sexual abuse and are also used for forced labor and organ harvesting. They are less likely to survive or escape, are less likely to be reported on or identified, and they suffer from higher rates of abuse than girls who are trafficked.\n\nAnd yet very little attention is given to this.  Missing boys, and especially missing minority boys, are often ignored by society and the media. To the point that people often assume that most of the victims are girls.  Something which is known as the [missing white woman syndrome](https://archive.is/mRIJL) (although in Canada there is a lot of attention given to missing indigenous women, even though 71% of missing indigenous people are men and boys).\n\nNote that I'm not saying these things to attack women, imply that they shouldn't receive custody, or to downplay the plight of girls.  Which is a lot more than you can say about people who try to paint men as the villains in this picture.  We should however be fair about what the facts are, and give male victimization, including victimization by women, the attention that it deserves.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16165212\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/childmaltreatment-facts-at-a-glance.pdf\n\nhttp://www.breakingthescience.org/SimplifiedDataFromDHHS.php\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0145213416302599\n\nhttps://www.savethechildren.org/us/charity-stories/child-trafficking-myths-vs-facts\n\n*Fair is fair and equal is equal.  Gender equality will never be fixed if we refuse to look at both sides of the coin.  We need to be honest about what the problems are, and stop ignoring them when they involve men, fathers, and boys.*",

    "text": "Confused and Lost with Blocking of Daughter I raised my daughter alone away from her mom, for the most part, since she was 6 months old. Her mom was around but barely and my daughter has lived full time with me for the last 10 years. This school year she moved in with her mom, who's staying with her parents, and everything went fine. I have not seen or spoken to my daughter in about 2 months. I originally attributed it to me working during the hours she's home from school. I expected her to spend some weekends at my home but that hasn't happened since after the first week of school started. I've tried calling her, asking her mom to have her call me, and more. Nothing. Today I reached out to her mom and asked what the deal was because something didnt feel right. Her mom calls me ans says she's stuck in a bad situation and she can't talk about it. I was confused and didn't understand what that had to do with my kid. She continued to say she couldn't talk about it but that she had no clue herself and that the law is what matters, not exact words but something to that effect. That blindsided me. What's going on? What's happening? So my daughter is being kept from me and I can't talk to or see her. Her mom swears she has no clue what's going on and that she didn't start this morning did her parents. So obviously as a man my first thoughts are I've been accused of inappropriate touching or possibly beating my child. I have no clue what else to think. For 10 years I've never once done anything of the sort. In August I took her to a doctor's appointment for a Tourette’s diagnosis. Her mom was with us. We went for lunch afterwards. My daughter was happy and holding my hand. Things were fine. I don't understand what's going on and I'm getting no answers. I'm lost. I'm scared of losing my child. I'm scared of facing whatever accusations come my way. I don't know what to do. Please....I need some advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Edit\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI finally found out what the issue is. Even my dad knew but was withholding the information bc he thought they'd find no merit and drop it. Apparently my daughter, who's 10 yo, told someone at her school that I snatched her pants/panties off her and hung them in the air and teased her with them. That's it. No more no less. 1) I have never done such a thing. 2) I don't know how to combat this. I've contacted a family attorney as I have no clue how to proceed. My daughter and I have always wrestled and played rough. She's a rough hard hitting girl but she's also got mood swings to boot, more than likely thanks to her mom's on mental issues stemming from depression and anxiety. So now I wait for the whomever to question my daughter, who doesn't process events and things well enough at 10, so she can relay any events that will be misconstrued or coached/lead to believe something happened. I've never touched my daughter in an inappropriate manner. I'm so lost and terrified. Thanks for any advice. I'll be working with an attorney moving forward.",

    "text": "Why circumcision is wrong regardless of gender. If there is even a single man who regrets or despises the fact that he was circumcised, whether botched or not, that is more than enough to justify abolishing it completely. Think about the men who are just so fucked in the head thanks to this perceived mutilation, me included. My circumcision was botched and it fucked me for life. Sometimes I wonder why I even get out of bed, or why I even try to go to work. For anyone that believes male circumcision is harmless, you're wrong. For me, my entire life spiralled out of control after I figured out that I had a botched circumcision. Nothing will make me feel better, until I get justice. I just have so much anger swelling inside of me with no way to release it. Just think about this, the next time you call male circumcision harmless. If you profit off of this disgusting molestation of men's rights, then I hope you will at least try to see it from my point of view. Stop this needless violence, save men, because that's what those infants become. The profit isn't worth how terribly you've damaged the trust between you and men. I'm almost too the point of renouncing my US citizenship for good. A country that betrays its people doesn't deserve to have the highest cost to renounce. You profited off my dick once already, don't press your luck.\n\nFor those who say to go pay and get my dick fixed, it's really not logical or that easy. Let's do an example.\n\nSomeone rear-ends your brand new Lamborghini, causing tens of thousands of dollars worth of damage, but they don't have car insurance. Now logically, who's fault was it? The guy who rear-ended you. Now, do you pay out of your own pocket to fix it yourself, or do you make the person responsible for the damage do it? Obviously, you're going to expect the person responsible to pay.\n\nA doctor circumcised me as an infant and botched it, causing tens of thousands of dollars worth of physical damage, lifelong impairment and extreme embarrassment and psychological agony for me. He doesn't tell my parents that he botched it, even though he went ahead and brought some of my scrotum onto the shaft to hide the damage. Now, logically speaking, who should have to pay to fix the damage to my dick, as well as my lifelong impairment and suffering due to the botched circumcision that he tried to hide? The doctor who is responsible for the damage or the freshly born infant?\n\nIn my opinion, the doctor did something much worse than the person who rear-ended your Lamborghini. The doctor panicked and tried to hide and bandage the damage, while the guy who rear-ended you didn't hit and run or try to bandage your vehicles body damage. The doctor should honestly be held to the same standard as someone who damaged someone else's property while trying to avoid paying for it entirely. The doctor deserves to be imprisoned. You can buy a new Lamborghini, but you can't buy a new penis.",

    "text": "Saw a stock photo title today that made me do a double take. It was a woman with a director’s camera, and the title of the image called her a “female director.” Okay, whatever. But then on the very same page, an image showed an older man on a filming set with a camera and the title just described him as a director. Couldn’t the title for the woman have been the same? Couldn’t we have deduced that she was a director too, based on the filming equipment? \n\nThe only way I can think of this being plausibly reasonable is if someone was specifically looking for an image of a female director. I dunno. Maybe I’m just having a knee jerk reaction. But then why not call the man a male director? It’s not the first time, that much I know. “Female doctor,” “female scientist,” etc have been used in contexts where it wasn’t necessary to add the female tag. It’s often done in an ironic “wow, women can actually be smart” kind of way. \n\nBlarg.",

    "text": "Make up my own name? \nHey everyone. So something that’s never sat right with me is taking a mans last name. Considering that to him, the idea of taking the woman he loves last name is unfathomable, so why should it be fathomable for me to take his? There’s a (sorta) simple solution here, and that is to just not take his last name and to keep the one that was given to me at birth, my fathers last name; however, that’s still a bit unsettling to me lol. \n\nMy father has been emotionally abusive to me ever since I was little, and recently I’ve decided to completely cut him out of my life. He is all things I never want to be—an abuser, manipulator, narcissist, racists, sexist, homophobic—everything bigot. Plus, there’s not much notability in having my family name in general. The previous generations did not accomplish much and rather just passed on their trauma to the next which ultimately led to me and how I feel about my dad (in other words, they weren’t/aren’t great people). Basically, I don’t feel much honor keeping my dads family last name. \n\nI’m a first generation college student about to graduate next year and am going to medical school. The more I think about my dads last name being on my diploma and doctorate degree makes me more and more sick, honestly. I don’t have any desire bringing honor to a family that has dishonored me so incredibly. For a year, I’ve been thinking about coming up with my own meaningful last name and changing it from my family last name. Has anyone ever done this? Or should I keep my dads last name because it is technically still my last name? The other issue is that since I have been thinking about it for a year, no name I’ve come across has lit the light bulb. \n\nI could take my moms last name (she’s also against the idea and would rather me just take a new mans name, NOT an option don’t suggest it haha), but it’s STILL A MANS LAST NAME!!

    "text": "An imaginary letter to Candace Owens and Shapiro \"we live in a society where femininity is looked down upon and masculinity is admired\" This is a mental letter i wrote to shapiro and candace owens after the harry styles wearing a dress episode. \n\n\nHi Ben and Candace, \n\n\nThis is a letter regarding your and candace owen's opinion on Harry Styles wearing a dress. I have, from watching your videos, come to the conclusion that you and candace are honest people who have well thought out opinions and actually care about society. Due to this, you donot hesitate to express opinions that earn you flak because you care about the truth. However, your opinion on this particular subject, is actually harmful to society, men and women in such a profound way, that I decided to write this email.\n\n\nToday we are living in a society of political equality, equality of oppurtunity, morality and availability of choices between men and women. But for centuries the world has not only enslaved and exploited women, but also this negative attitude towards women also extended to a negative attitude towards femininity and feminine traits. Slaves were often castrated before being owned, as once un-masculinized, a man becomes someone who doesn't deserve agency and can be owned.\n\n\nBut femininity is not weakness. If masculinity helps defend civilization against threats, femininity helps build up a society of harmony that is protected by masculinity. For healthy adulthood and functioning, both men and women must inculcate both masculine and feminine traits within themselves. So many feminine/female typical traits actually help build better leadership like conscientiousness, introspection, ability to process and work with limitations/ vulnerability and emotions, and empathy. Masculine traits like assertiveness, and ability to draw boundaries are also very valuable. \n\n\nBut men are shunned if feminine. For eg: Justin Bieber was harrassed online for several years for having a not yet masculine voice, singing about love and having a female fan base. It wasn't until he cheated on his girlfriend, had stupid anger bursts and behaved like a spoilt, bratty jerk (code words for hypersexuality and aggression) that he won male respect. 1Direction faced the exact same fate. The word gay was used against them as an insult. (Since gay means feminine and hence condemnable. I have never seen lesbian used as a insult in this sense)\n\n\nEven women are victims of this issue. If you read YA fiction, you will see it filled with aggressive, impulsive women who are not exactly strong, per my opinion. An example would be the characterization of bella from twilight, a hollywood movie, as a woman who punches werewolves when she is 'pissed' off at them and could not get along with other girls so now she is a 'strong' woman. (she was nothing like that in the books) And the \"cool girl\", \"not like other girls\" phenomena. Eg: Ginny weasley in Harry Potter novels. Which is why the movie legally blonde is the greatest feminist statement in recent times, because the movie does not merely show a strong woman, it shows a pink donning, blonde, fashionista in a strong, intelligent light. Which is simply revolutionary.\n\n\nFemininity is healthy. You may disagree, but femininity is not obedience or subservience. Women calculate for risk better and are less likely to fall for financial scams like Game stop. Women are better empathisers and communicators ( women are less likely to laugh at prank videos and more likely to feel bad for a hurt football team player in a football game while men respond with disappointment than sympathy) This makes women better leaders, negotiators, organizers, doctors, psychologists, etc.. There are also male typical/masculine traits that are admirable, like assertiveness, but masculine traits are already admired by society, but feminine traits are somehow looked down upon. To the point where girls are now hesitant to say they like pink. Yes, saying that you like pink is considered girly and shameful amongst women, girls prefer to say that they like black, as it is more cool.  Girls just hate being girly girls because it is considered to be weak and subservient. \n\n\nYou say asian societies donot feminize their men. Asian societies choose to build so called strong men but tell women to enslave themselves. Women are killed in female foeticide or people cry when they are born as they are considered 'weak liabilities.'\n\n\nThe sucide rate amongst men is 4 times higher than women. This is because to be in touch with your emotions or to seek help is 'feminine.' There was recently an incident in which a school boy was 'humped' by his classmates (it would have been rape had he been a woman). He held his phone trying to call his mother to cry for help, but did not know how.  Men are repeatedly raped and abused, but hesitate to even admit it to themselves. Horrible male on male bullying of gender atypical \"sissies\" is disturbingly common.\n\n\nWhen Harry Styles wore that dress, when men are allowed to cry/exhibit emotion by society, it is empowering. As for once, femininity is not weak. Femininity is not lack of leadership/achievement. Femininity is not lack of agency/stupidity/subservience.\n\n\n\nA strong man loves a strong woman and isn't threatened by her. A strong man isn't threatened by femininity, in clothing or jewellery. A man is not \"weakened\" by a dress. If you believe that when a man wears a dress, he loses agency, strength, and ability to defend the civilization, do you believe that women, since they wear dresses, lack agency and strength? To me, you saying feminizing men is a problem is saying that femininity is a problem...ie., it is bad/weak and not meant for 'strong, proper' men.\n\n\nBut you say, men and women are meant for different roles? How did these roles help the self esteem of women? Thanks to these roles, women could not pursue a career, make money, choose/judge their partners, or achieve things. It was the 'role' of men. If you feel it is perfectly fine for women to do the afore mentioned things, then that means women are strong and admirable, and men are not weakened by femininity. Please reconsider your ideas on femininity. \n\nRegards,\n\nA person who cannot afford a daily wire subscription to contact you directly.",

    "text": "5 Myths about Reproductive Rights. Myth #1: Reproductive rights is a euphemism for abortion. \n\nTruth: Reproductive rights, as a whole, encompasses far more than just abortions, it also encompasses sterilization surgeries, birth control, prenatal health care, STD/STI tesing and treatment, family planning and a lot more. Believe it nor not, it is actually possible to be anti-abortion but pro reproductive rights. If you are against abortion (believing that it is only justoified in cases were the pregnancy threatens the mother’s life) but you believe that birth control should be available to teenagers with no need for the teenager’s parents permission, birth control should be put in vending machines and be available for $0.75, you should be allowed to get a vasectomy or tubal litigation surgery at Starbucks and that insurane should be required to cover the cost of STD/STI testing and treatment (that last one might already be the law, I don’t know, I am a bit fussy on the exact details of that situation), then you are pro reproductive rights. \n\nMyth #2: People regretting sterilization surgeries is actually a real issue that we need to be concerned about.  \n\nThis one requires a bit of explaining. Technically speaking, even though anyone over the age of 18 is legally allowed to have a sterilization surgery, your doctor might refuse to sterilize you for fear that you may regret it.  \n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC558215/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC558215/) [https://www.vice.com/en\\_us/article/9kxam7/tubal-ligation-requirements-doctor-denials](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kxam7/tubal-ligation-requirements-doctor-denials) [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/parenting/why-dont-more-american-men-get-vasectomies.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/parenting/why-dont-more-american-men-get-vasectomies.html) \n\nIn Belgium, there is a law which says that a woman is not allowed to have a tubal ligation surgery unless she has given birth before OR she is at least 40 years of age. That is discriminatory against childless women under the age of 40. To hear You Tuber Vegan Gains talk about that policy in Belgium, click this link ( [https://youtu.be/8BtzOhQCJfw](https://youtu.be/8BtzOhQCJfw) ). \n\nTruth: If you get sterilized and decide later on that you want kids, you could adopt, hire a surrogate or employ the services of a sperm bank. If, on the other hand, an individual who never wants kids is not allowed to have a sterilization surgery, a child could be born to two parents who are not prepared to take care of him or her. Even if an individual who does have a sterilization surgery goes on to regret it, at least that only affects the one responsible for the sterilization surgery happening. You chose to have that sterilization surgery, so it only affects you, that is completely fair. If you can't get sterilized and you have an unplanned child, that child is statistically more likely to be abused or neglected and is statistically more likely to live in poverty. That isn't fair to the child who had no control over the circumstances of his/her own conception and birth.\n\nMyth #3: In debates about abortion, or other issues pertaining to reproductive rights, an ad hominem attack carries the same weight as an actual argument. \n\nIn debates about abortion, it is common for both pro-life advocates and pro-choice advocates to make ad hominem attacks. For pro-life advocates, they tend to call pro-choice advocates spoiled millenials or stupid femanazis, as if that counts as a real argument. On the other hand, one of the most common arguments used by pro-choice advocates is the “you’re a straight white male argument.” That doesn’t mean that all or even most pro-choice advocates do this, but many do.    \n\nTruth: When debating about abortion, or any issue pertaining to politics for that matter, it is usually better to attack the argument rather than the person. \n\nThis complaint, by many (though not all or even most) pro-choice adovcates about straight white men making laws about women’s reproductive rights is not honest. I know this, because pro-choice advocates are happy about Roe v Wade and that ruling was made by straight white men. These pro-choice advocates actually have a problem with the policies themselves, not the people making them. If congress were trying to outlaw abortion pro-choice adcovates would have a problem with that policy, even if the people supporitng this policy were black lesbians. \n\nMyth #4: Reproductive rights is only a women’s issue. \n\nTruth: Since both men and women are involved in the process of making babies, any law, any policy and decision regarding abortion, birth control, sterilization surgeries, prenatal health care, matrnity/paternity leave etc., will effect both men and women. \n\nMyth #5: Any man who does not want to be responsible for a child who he fathered does not have to. \n\nTruth: The way that reproductive rights currently works, if a woman gets pregnant and chooses to keep the child, she can legally sue the father for child support and he legally has to pay child support to the child, until the child is of age. The father may not have even wanted to keep the child. He may have wanted the mother to abort and she may have given birth anyway just to spite him, yet he still has to be responsible for the child who he fathered whether he wants to or not. \n\nTo be fair though, there also exist some opposite scenarios where the mother gives the child up for adoption, the father gets custody of the child and the mother is forced to pay child support. \n\nTo hear more about reproductive rights and the controversy thereof, check out these links. \n\n[https://youtu.be/h83Hi-4hbvc](https://youtu.be/h83Hi-4hbvc) \n\n[https://youtu.be/PeaO-D1cP5I](https://youtu.be/PeaO-D1cP5I) \n\n[https://youtu.be/JRdq2zqGxgY](https://youtu.be/JRdq2zqGxgY) \n\n[https://youtu.be/UFYxlmRRnkw](https://youtu.be/UFYxlmRRnkw) \n\n[https://youtu.be/Z3UmXu97yRQ](https://youtu.be/Z3UmXu97yRQ) \n\n[https://youtu.be/50UCPLmNdnM](https://youtu.be/50UCPLmNdnM) \n\n[https://youtu.be/lr4zz9JPHig](https://youtu.be/lr4zz9JPHig)",
