    "text": "Sick Of My Racist Students  I knew what I was getting into signing on to teach at a rural southern private school as a foot in the door. But February has rolled around and I'm starting to crack.\n\n My principal talks about \"Mexicans living on top of each other.\" Never mind that our lone two Mexican kids have more money than anyone else here.\n\n I had a kid write an essay about interracial couples being \"an abomination to God.\" Principal didn't see what the problem was.\n\n One of my kids went to a basketball game and yelled \"GO PICK MY COTTON!\" to a black player. Coach didn't see what the problem was.\n\n Was showing a TED Talk about mercy and forgiveness and a kid said \"just because I'm blessed doesn't mean I should help these poor black people strung out on drugs.\" I semi-snapped and said \"Really? That's funny. Because I grew up poor and my mom was a junkie. Do I look black to you?\"\n\n I'm done here after the year whether I have another job lined up or not. I just want to figure out how I keep from snapping until then.",
