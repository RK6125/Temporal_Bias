    "text": "Got placed on Probation at work. Probation terms sound very vague and subjective. Am I basically screwed? So I had a probation hearing at my job.  Basically the accusations were that\n\n\\- I am not being enough of a team player.  I work in a private school and while part of my job is to run the labs, I also teach some courses in Technology, Computer Science, and Maths.  Recently the Dean has been dumping off a lot of busywork on me, for example asking me to correct the exams questions of instructors in the Maths department.  I at first  said nothing, but it's starting to pile up and it turns out that there are a lot of mistakes in the exam.  Also, there is one teacher who simply has another test book and rather than come up with her own content simply photographs the stuff with her phone, then uploads it to her ***instagram***.  I was supposed to go in and re-type her questions.\n\n\\- I do not take enough interest in after-school social life by attending games, socializing with my \\[American\\] colleagues.  I live in Taiwan where I'm an expat and socializing with my colleagues (even if they themselves are not Taiwanese) is part of the culture here.  I often prefer to hang out with the Taiwanese people after work because it gives me a chance to practice Mandarin and Taiwanese.  Besides, they do more interesting things besides clubbing or drinking.\n\n\\- I'm only doing the bare minimum by not mentoring or volunteering for assistant coaching.  They claimed this was because I'm lazy.  I tried signing up both at the beginning of the year, and for next semester but got denied for everything I signed up for.  I nearly made it to the IMO when I was in high school and participated in the Putnam (with a grand total of 4 points out of 120 - though I'm told this is not a \"horrible\" score) when I was in college, so I instinctively signed up to mentor the math team.  Denied.  I am a 3rd dan in Shotokan and fought competitively, so I signed up to be an assistant coach (incidentally I would have outranked the actual coach).  Also denied.  I even signed up for stupid things like \"Foreign Movies Club\" (basically the students just watch a movie that's not American or Taiwanese) and got rejected.\n\n\\- Students complained about the way I teach my class.\n\n\\- I am creating a \"negative\" work environment.\n\n\\- I used some Python scripts to automate some boring tasks (like batch renaming files and adding watermarks).  I was told I couldn't do this because it could potentially be dangerous (a bunch of liberal arts folks not knowing what they're talking about).\n\nSo the terms of probation (which apparently will last less than 30 days, though in theory they're supposed to give you a minimum of 60 days) and I quote:\n\n>Mr.Lightgeschwindigkeit will show an improved cultural fit with the members of the campus community,  \n>  \n>Mr. L-- will demonstrate sufficient community engagement by attending social events with colleagues of diverse backgrounds  \n>  \n>Mr. L will, to the satisfaction of the Committee, help parents feel more supported with the learning of their children through active communication strategies  \n>  \n>Mr. L will demonstrate that his continued employment is of positive net value to the community through improved involvement outside of classroom hours.  \n>  \n>Mr. L will refrain from using or downloading any software without the express written permission of the management\n\nAm I basically screwed?",

    "text": "Will I be able to get a job with a bad reference? I have a strong feeling that I have a bad reference holding me back from obtaining employment. I plan to do a reference checking service to see if that’s the case. And if they are I plan to take legal action. \n\nHowever, I’m an African American female so I don't have a lot of fire power, just being realistic. But before I do: can I get a job with a bad reference? How can I overcome a bad reference? Is it a good idea to apply for jobs with a bad reference?\n\nI’ve made mistakes in my life.\n\n\nEdit: here’s the whole story.\n\nI’m in NYC. I work in healthcare.\n\nJust because there’s laws doesn’t mean employers [about references and such] follow them. Example: The 2nd to last employer never sent me my lady check after they fired me. Then lied and stopped my unemployment. Thats illegal. That’s a different story though.\n\nFor this post: I worked in a small office so there’s no HR department. When I left they told me I couldn’t use them as a reference, which I don’t. I left without two weeks notice after the doctor told me I should I find some place else to work if I couldn’t get along with this drugged out, racist coworker. I tried everything I could to mediate the situation. So I agreed and I left. However, I put them on my resume as work history. I think I’m going to remove them.\n\nI think employers are calling them after my interviews and given that there’s no HR just the office manager, she is giving unfavorable references. \n\nWhy do I think this? When I was interviewing (I’ll explain) I had no problem getting interviews. I usually got to schedule a minimum of 2 per week. The interviews seem to go stellar but then I don’t hear back. I’ve even tried reaching out and the interviewer is always “busy” doing something — a meeting, running late, etc. Or they’ll “call [me] back”I’ve tried asking on different days. \n\nNow I was only interviewing for 2 months and managed to land a per diem job in a medical office (it was sorta not what I applied for either but that’s another story). I felt like I went on about 25+ interviews in that time period, but maybe I’m being spoiled given the short period of time I was actively searching. \n\nHowever, at my current job I only have hours when someone is on vacation, calls out, etc. So it’s not consistent. I use DoorDash and Postmates to make up for it. Why am I staying?i was hoping it would become full-time but I don’t seen that happening anytime soon. \n\nI’m working on building a professional image by solving some personal problems like having reliable transportation before I start searching again; hence why I’m also going to do a reference check.\n\nSorry that was long.",

    "text": "I think my boss has a buttcrack fetish I recently moved to a new city. I was looking for work and a new restaurant opened close to where I now live. The place had a hiring sign so I went in and applied. A day later, I got a call in for an interview. I was interviewed briefly by the manager, lets call him Tony, and told I could start right away. \n\nOn my first official day, Tony gave me my work t-shirt. It was a black golf type shirt with the restaurant logo on it. It was kind of small for me - if I raised my arms my belly would show. I told him the shirt was small, but he insisted they were ordering more and that would have to do for now. (Which haven't arrived yet) There are just a few people working here. A couple of guys and mostly girls. The guys have shirts that fit them and the girls all have tighter shirts for some reason. I didn't think too much of it. I was then informed that the brand of the restaurant was casual, so we had to wear black jeans. He preferred that we all had the same look so he specifically wanted us to wear skinny low ones from American Eagle for some reason. I've never had a boss specify an exact style of pants. Usually the instruction was black pants, no jeans. I didn't even think AE sold that kind anymore.\n\nThe second day I came in, dressed as I was instructed. I was the only one there that time. Tony told me that he wanted the fridges at the bar to be cleaned out before the store opened. The fridges were all on the ground, so I had to squat really low to be able to reach them. As soon as I squatted to clean the first one, I could definitely feel a breeze hitting the top of my butt. I tried pulling up my pants and pulling down my shirt but it didn't really do much because the clothes were all too small. Tony was set up right behind me on a laptop, and I just knew he had a perfect, close up few of my buttcrack hanging out. If I turned around I could see him glance away each time. I knew he was definitely just ogling my butt. I'm pretty sure his camera was out a few times too. \n\nThis has been going on for a while. And its not just me, other girls (but strangely never the guys) are always told to clean out the fridges, etc. One time, he even had us clean the baseboards, and I knew he was just checking out our butts. I tried buying different jeans or wearing a long top underneath, but I find it gets too hot with another shirt underneath the work shirt, and the low rise ones are strangely the most comfortable ones to wear for a long shift. I also don't want to spend a lot of money on fancy designer jeans to wear to work everyday - these are working clothes. I don't mind if my butt shows if I'm doing something, AS LONG AS A MIDDLE AGED MAN ISN'T OGLING ME. \n\nI really don't know what to do. I don't have actual proof, and its just a suspicion I have. It would be a weird conversation to bring up. I like my coworkers and the tips are really good. The job is fun. But I'm just annoyed that my manager can't stop staring at my bum.",

    "text": "Need a little advice/encouragement about moving to a new city  \n\nHello my fellow ladies. I'm in great need of some words of advise, wisdom, and encouragement. I was wondering if anyone has moved to a different place than they originally grew up? For instance, were you a country girl that moved to the city or a city girl that moved to the country? Were you an American that moved overseas or immigrated to America? What challenges did you face? I am completely torn with whether I should move to a new city, as I want to develop my career, be more successful, and grow in a community. Unfortunately, I live in a very small town in Texas and opportunities are rare here, especially for women. It isn't something that I am just making up in my head. I literally have heard people where I work say a women should be at home cooking and cleaning. We don't employ very many women either. My boss gives all the men in the company raises, handshakes, and pats on the back. But I work 100x harder than most of them and never get any recognition for my work. It's so heartbreaking when I know I can do more for the world out there. And there are probably companies out there that would love to have me. I would love to shine and get the recognition I deserve. Although this is all I have ever known. I am just a small town country girl that grew up driving tractors in pastures, riding horses, and enjoying the quiet countryside. I'm not sure I can manage the hustle and bustle of the city life...\n\nI want to know if you have had to make a big change in a demographic area before. Please tell me your stories of how it turned out. Did you like it? Did you stay? Did you go back home after becoming homesick? I need your words of wisdom of how you knew it was the right leap to make. I feel like I'm very versatile and do well in most situations thrown at me. I'm just so scared to move to a new city by myself and worry I will be completely overwhelmed once I get head deep in changing jobs, meeting all new co-workers, meeting new neighbors, traffic, and finding a place to live! Thank you in advance for any advice you have for this small town country girl. I greatly appreciate it!  <3  :-)",

    "text": "What to do when you see a potential situation Obligatory Disclaimer(s): Long post. Throwaway for Privacy Reasons. The race definitions I use below are the ones preferred by the National Institutes of Health and the US Office of Management and Budget.  \nHi All,  \nI am truly looking for advice on what I should do in the future, should this situation ever arise again. I thought about posting in r/AmItheAsshole, but I really want advice from a female perspective on what would make them the most comfortable and safe. I am a person who wants equality for all, and I feel that white men, like me, can and need to do a better job at making sure that those around them feel the same protections. By the way, I am white, and the couple that I talk about are black, although I hope it wouldn't make a difference in how I would handle the situation.\n\n  \nI am an Adult, American male living in a fairly typical middle-sized city in the Midwestern United States, think about as average as you can. I was at my parents' house yesterday, and my mom and I decided to go for a late evening walk, about 9:00 pm. As we get to the end of their very suburban block, and are about to turn onto a busier sidewalk, we see a teen-aged female walking very quickly with a male of a similar age following behind. The situation looked distressed. My mom and I both have a similar feeling that something wasn't right, and I decided that we should cross the street and follow them from over there as I wanted to monitor the situation without being directly involved. She continued to walk faster, and soon screaming and crying began. As it escalated, my mom decides that we should be directly behind them, just in case it escalates further. They continued at a rapid pace, very nearly a jog. Finally, I slow down a little bit, as I didn't want my presence to raise the level any further, however my mom continued the pace about 30 yards behind them, and at this point, she is continuing to cry, shout, etc.  \n\n\nI decide it is time to get the police involved, and call 911. I explain to the dispatcher the situation, and she said she would send an officer. A male who was outside of his house starts yelling at the girl (I don't need that, get away from my house, you \"Female Dog\", etc.), not helping the situation in the slightest.    \n\n\nMy mom gets the attention of the girl, and asks her if she is okay, and through her muffled cries, she says she is. The couple stops a couple blocks later, and I back off to a point where I can see both the couple and an intersection that I had given the dispatcher. About seven minutes later, the officer pulls up, and explain to him the situation. He said he saw the couple and they just looked like they were out for a stroll, but that he would go check on them again, so we, my mom and I, decide to head back home.  \n\n\nSo, I guess I am wondering if I did the right thing. I, looking back on it, wish I would have called the police a little earlier. Should I have just not gotten involved, and let her fight her own battles? Again, I just think we have work to do, and want to be part of the solution and not the problem.  \n\n\nThanks for reading and being gentle in your replies.",

    "text": "Office paediatrics doesn't exist in the UK, would it be an answer to some of our problems? This subreddit is great for comparing systems around the world, especially as we don't really meet American doctors in the UK.\n\nIn the UK paediatric training takes place after 5-6 years of undergraduate medical school, 2 years of foundation (internship), working as a doctor in 4 month rotations, then you do 8 years of paediatric training. Within the next few years this may decrease to 7 years. After this you are a consultant (attending) in general paediatrics, managing outpatient clinics, acute takes, ward work, on calls.\n\nDoctors work 48hr per week, as opposed to 100 (?) hour weeks in the USA.\n\nSubspecialties in paediatrics also train in 8 years, but may have fellowship/phD years as well.\n\nGeneral practice (family medicine) takes place after your two years of foundation, and training takes 3 years, half in hospital, half in GP.\n\nMany GPs will never have worked in a paediatric department, and will qualify having only done 5-6 weeks of paediatrics in medical school.\n\nFor day to day problems, GP is the gatekeeper, you bring your child to the GP first. You cannot see a paediatrician. There is no office paediatrician, this is not a role which exists. Paediatric consultants will have a routine wait of 3-6 months to be seen in clinic. \n\nThere are not many paediatricians in the UK compared to GPs, and the paediatric college is not filling their training numbers so this will get worse.\n\nAs a result, if the GP is not trained in paediatrics, they will be very unsure, and refer children to paediatrics who could have been managed in the surgery. Which results in consultants who spent 8 years training in acute paediatrics managing constipation, coughs and colds, often in an assessment unit during antisocial hours.\n\nIn the UK we often talk about how great it would be to have some form of office paediatrician, maybe shorted training, only works 9-5 in an office, seeing children instead of the GP, preventing unnecessary referrals. This is what happens in the USA I understand?\n\nIt would seem to be a better system, offering an option of better work life balance for paediatricians, and better service for families than seeing a GP who does not have paediatric training. A GP for children.\n\nDoes it work in practice elsewhere in the world?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The UK paediatric training model, after 2 years of working as a foundation doctor.](https://preview.redd.it/5zo5d2savmi31.jpg?width=1013&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c7748c18b4c23e330ae5dfbb36f51046ed7a16a6)",

We'll call her J.\n\nStory is, J was brought to our E.R. after 2 days of laying on the side unconscious. She had alcohol and meth in her system, and she was diagnosed with an anoxic brain injury, spent a few weeks in the ICU, was intubated, in a coma and all that jazz for about 3 weeks. She was then down graded to another floor where they couldn't handle her, so they sent her to us.\n\nMy unit is different than most due to the fact that we have 22 beds with cameras and 2 people that monitor the camera 24/7, and a runner to go to jumpy, high fall risk patients.\n\nSo she comes to our floor in need of a camera since she was mentally drunk all day every day. She would literally ask every 10 minutes or so for a new vodka-water, she was drinking PITCHERS of water. But over about a month of her being there, when asking for her drink we'd tell her no, but suggest a Sprite, juice etc instead and she was happy with it. \n\nIn all this she needed guardianship and still needs placement. See, she in not American shes Scandinavian of some sort, she has a brother close to 500 miles away and the rest over of her family back home. None of which that has the ability to care for her.  \n\nSo we get her a guardian, and ope, doesnt look like shes a legal US citizen so they are dealing with that before we can get her placement, and funding to pay for said placement, also shes only in her mid 50's so theres that too.\n\nThis poor woman, about 3 months ago went from being A&Ox1 to A&O 3.5 I would say, it takes her about a week for her short term to remember most thing-this is important. \n\nSo about 2 months ago, a nurse and CNA brought her a coat, and would walk with her outside and sit with her and let her enjoy some fresh air. It was usually only for 5-20 minutes, but it was something.\n\nWell one day Ms. J decided she wanted to go out and left, she was gone maybe 10 minutes, but got lost coming back to the unit (ok to be fair ever visitors who've been coming for weeks still get loss). But she goes to the ER admitting desk and asks for help back. After that the guardian said she absolutely can not go outside anymore.\n\nThis is where I get pissed off. J has now been cooped up in the hospital for half a year, the guardian NEVER COMES, never makes sure she has any toiletries, and never talks to the patient. We have a therapy guard that's locked and suppose to be for pt use that we cnat even take her too. A garden that part of our raised funded and the other half come from donations. Donations from when a mass shooting happened in my city in 2016, at a music festival, that my hospital got slammed with victims, even though we are not trauma. \n\nThis woman has loss all her spirit. She does nothing but sleep and pick at her food. She'll barely shower, and she barely smiles. Shes been medically cleared for months now and shes a walkie-talkie so she doesnt get as much TLC, she has literally 0 meds. \n\nThe other day (Friday) I walked in, she was so pale, eyes dark/slightly sunken in according to my friend that was taking care of her, she begged to take her outside and since it's an upper management issue, there is literally nothing she can do. And the guardian doesnt care (shes hardly ever reachable by phone) . \n\nWe plan on going up to our CEO tomorrow and talk to him. This poor woman is treated worse than a  Prisoner, and it's not right! So that's were we are currently.\n\nThanks for the read.\n\nTl;dr- pt has been in the hospital for over a year, public guardian doesnt want her going outside under any circumstance. Patient is now a pale, human ball of depression.\n\nEdit: she is allowed to walk the halls of the unit, but that's only 2 hallways in a V shape and only one small single window at the end of each, But she does t bother anymore. If anyone has any ideas on how to help or advocate for her, please let me know.",

I know this subreddit skews very American but I’ll take any advice I can get. \n\nMy department organises the December rota by saying you can either work Christmas OR New Year. You can request what you want to work, but if too many people request Christmas off (or vice versa), you will work the opposite of what you worked last year.\n\nIn 2018, I worked Christmas Day itself and 26/27 December night shifts (the 26th December is a public holiday in the UK). I was off for New Year, returning to work on the 2nd January. Sucks, but hey, at least, I’ll get Christmas Day with my family next year right? \n\nToday, I find out that I have Christmas Day off. I’m on a 12 hour day 26th December, then nights. Working a 12 hour day shift on New Year’s Day, nights 2nd and 3rd. My family are a seven hour drive away, rendering my Christmas Day off pointless. I appreciate that this is no one else’s problem (I wasn’t forced to move here) but I was fully expecting Boxing Day off having worked it last year, and requesting Christmas off when the sign up sheet went up.\n\nWe have a very active department groupchat for shift swaps, but so far no one wants to take my 26th day shift, and I don’t expect people to bite my hand off for it. It is a public holiday here.\n\nMy plan of action for tomorrow at work is to to find out if there is any kind of written policy that states either Christmas or New Year, and I will speak to my line manager as we are both on shift together, but I am fully expecting a ‘too bad, so sad’ response.\n\nAm I being unreasonable to be angry? It feels totally unfair to be essentially working both holidays. I’m already not overly happy at my workplace and I feel like rage-quitting.",

    "text": "Last Minute Prepping for Classes I'm a high school Culinary Arts teacher. I'm dual certified with 17 years of prior experience as an elementary teacher. This includes 8 years abroad at Americans schools in Saudi Arabia and Lebanon. After earning a 3rd degree as a chef, I worked in the food service industry for a few years before returning to education as the chef instructor of high school Culinary Arts program. This will be my 13th year teaching Culinary Arts. It will also be my 30th year in education. \n\nOne other thing I will mention at the outset is that I'm autistic, though I didn't learn this until I was 54. This was nearly 5 years ago. \n\nI've been able to function as a teacher because my classroom is always highly structured. As a chef; school law, district policy, the state instructional standards, school rules, my budget, the availability of tools and equipment, the length of a class period, and the level of my own skills have defined the parameters within which I've been able  work with my students. Pictured below is a composed cucumber salad that my Culinary II students produced as a test of their knife skills. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6zpnmhzqpf31.jpg?width=532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dee7669116c8764b21763d631a0dbb0fc3ae7866\n\nWhile each school year brings uncertainties which include not knowing what my budget will be, wondering what the chemistry of each class will feel like, and wondering if any of my students will be \"problems,\" this year has brought additional challenges. My immediate supervisor lost her job because the principal decided to do away with the dean's slot in favor of an assistant principal's position. Although the dean applied for this position, she was not one of the two finalists who will be invited for a 2nd round of interviews on Monday. Once the new AP has been hired, my supervisor will be out of a job. The school year starts on Monday, August 12th which means that she won't have any time to find another position or to relocate back to the greater Vegas area. \n\nAfter ten consecutive years of budget cuts, the teachers' union has also called for a strike. When will the strike be? How long will it last? Will the state legislature finally give us the additional funding we need to avoid cutting jobs and programs? Will the superintendent retaliate against teachers who went on strike and if he does take action, will any of us lose our jobs or will the reprisals be limited to an administrative letter of reprimand that will be placed in our personnel files? \n\nI despise uncertainty. \n\nIt doesn't help that as someone who's neurologically prone towards being a reclusive introvert that I kept to myself over the summer with no company other than my cats. While it doesn't bother me to be alone, having to interact with others after 10 weeks of self imposed isolation is really hard.\n\nSince teachers were due to report back on Wednesday, August 7th, on Monday the principal sent out an email to our faculty. We were told to wear color coded shirts. The color we wore depended upon what we taught. Reading between the lines, I just knew that our first day back at work would involve teachers being grouped with each other and that there would be lots of movement and discussion.\n\nSince none of this was autistic friendly (since many of us are sensitive to noise and movement), I emailed my principal to tell her that I was particularly stressed out for the coming year. I asked if I could be excused to work in my room instead of having to participate in our first day activities.\n\nEven though the principal knows that I'm autistic, she told me that, \"We all get stressed out,\" and denied my request. I subsequently had a panic attack. On Wednesday as I was getting ready for work, I broke into tears and had a meltdown. I subsequently emailed the school's office manager to tell her that I would be absent. \n\nI wound up missing the entire week. I just couldn't bring myself to go to work. My supervisor, (the dean who is being replaced with an AP), talked me into coming into school this Saturday since the school would be largely empty and there wouldn't be anyone to bother me.\n\nSince I didn't have my keys, I agreed to meat with my dean at 9 AM on Saturday. This is what my room looked like. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z3gpt2ijupf31.jpg?width=532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9fe5c0f1145b18dd038e83f50731c23a7787cdf8\n\nSince I'm really organized, this is what my room looked like after 4 1/2 hours. I set up my desktop computer and printer. I set up the laptop and confirmed that  both the projector and the sound system worked. I set up the student tables, and put up bulletin boards. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wl53hoyqupf31.jpg?width=532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbeffe14f63802ecb611dbd214be13b866a3a128\n\nThe attached kitchen isn't ready, but then again it doesn't need to be. Since I won't have my budget for two more weeks and will need to train all students (including those who were with me last year) in food safety and sanitation, I will have two weeks to set up the kitchen.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/twnittm3vpf31.jpg?width=532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db3fc8a58ab2fa9aa26756c12e0a6136f9544b6f\n\nThe classroom is ready to go. I'm using the same lesson plans that I've used for the last 4 years. Since some high school students won't be happy with their schedules, the first week is always \"open\" so that students may change their classes as needed. During this time we don't teach to the standards. We go over expectations and rules and emergency procedures. We do assessment testing. We use getting to know you activities, though given the fact that we're a small rural school, all of the kids will already know each other unless they transferred in. This year I'll probably have my advanced students set up the kitchen. As it says in the Medieval romance, Sir Bevis of Hampton, \"Many hands make light the work.\"\n\nI am grateful to my supervising dean for having helped me  to (partially) get over my anxiety for the coming year, at least enough so that I could set up my room. As the year progresses and we fall back into the habit of our routines, things should get better. Knock on wood.\n\nI just hope my (soon to be former) dean will land on her metaphorical feet.",

    "text": "My co-teacher is lazy, very critical of my teaching, as well as demeaning to the students...... (RANT) This is my first year teaching high school level curriculum. While rewarding it can be difficult, my school is extremely unorganized. A week and a half into school I had no books for my students, missing desk, I haven't gotten any IEP's, and a co-teacher placed in my class without notice. The periods are long 2 hours. We are suppose to split the teaching equally (1 hour a piece). However, he does nothing..... He posts on the smart-board a \"do now\", doesn't go over the instructions, and sits down fanning himself the entire period. The \"do now\" usually takes about 10-15 mins at most, when the students are finish he says you can go ahead. For the entire hour and 45 mins, he sits there. He offers no classroom assistance, he offers no help with classroom management, NOTHING. Some days he doesn't even do the \"do now\" with the students, he plays a game for 10 mins, or simply does nothing. This wouldn't annoy me as much if he didn't criticize my teaching style when class is over. \"I would have done this...\" \"You should teach this....\" \"I didn't like that you did that....\" I think to myself why at no point does he step in to teach? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSadly, he has very poor vocal reading skills, which makes it hard for him to teach when I implore him to do so. He keeps saying repeatedly 90% of the students in my district are special needs. His exact words are \"Most of these kids are special needs or slow.\" Which is extremely false..... And I am not sure where he is getting these numbers from. When kids are disrespectful he says that is simply their culture..... I had to say excuse me..... He went on to say \"It's their African american culture, they are special education, and they are rude.\" I want to coin him as racist but know it will be hard to push that when he is African born in France. I am not sure what to do. I am currently in my classroom, upset, and not wanting to go into the class with that man. As a woman born in the city, and afro-latina my mother being African American I am offended. What should I do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the grammar errors, I am a bit upset on my break.",

After immersing raw shrimp in batter, they deep fried the crustaceans. The fried shrimp was served on a garlic-butter toasted French roll on a bed of shredded lettuce. The shrimp were topped with a spicy Remoulaude Sauce that was made by mixing mayonnaise with paprika, minced garlic, pickle juice, Creole seasoning, and hot sauce. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3qwo9bbo39p31.jpg?width=562&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89b70d519e7239c951a3ea37d7301cb6d313b830\n\nWhile the Culinary III students worked on their sandwiches, the Culinary II students produced a Chinese inspired beef with broccoli. I say \"Chinese inspired\" because beef with broccoli is actually an American created dish in much the same way that Orange Chicken was also created in the United States. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xs0pasmx49p31.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9e580abc97baceb3d5f8a93a9484763635ee041\n\nThis is my 13th year on the job as the chef instructor of a Culinary Arts program. As a former elementary teacher, it's also my 30th year in the classroom.\n\nHaving spent 17 years as an elementary teacher, I can honestly say that I prefer being in the kitchen. The kitchen has some huge advantages.  Since most students like to eat, most students are actually motivated to participate. In learning how to read a recipe, how to measure, how to use a knife and so forth, these students are developing vocational skills that could lead to decent paying jobs in the food service industry. Even if some of them have no interest in becoming cooks or chefs, the skills they learn in Culinary Arts can always be applied at home. \n\nWould you believe that in the Clark County School District, we have SIXTY-EIGHT different CTE programs?  In addition to commonly taught CTE programs like Culinary Arts, wood shop, and automotive repair, we have CTE instructors who teach floriculture (the cultivation of flowers), video game design, animation, pastry, hospitality management (hotel service),and other fields. \n\nHaving been an elementary teacher, I understand the importance of imparting a basic education to our students. Having said this, do all children really need to go to college? The average student debt is now $38,390. While this would make perfect sense if college degrees automatically led to good paying jobs, a [new study](https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/study-suggests-many-college-graduates-are-underemployed/4543268.html) shows that 43% of college graduates take their first jobs in positions that don't actually require a college degree. In contrast to the emphasis in many districts (including my own) on college readiness skills, a study from the [ McKinsey Global Institute](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/47985737/ns/business-forbes_com/t/you-dont-need-college-make-good-money/#.XY7ZHvdlDIU) shows that in 2020 employers around the world will need an estimated 45 million additional mid-level workers whose qualifications will be a high school education and vocational training. Of the 47 million new jobs in the United States that were created last year, 30% didn't require anything more than an associate's degree or a vocational certificate. \n\nWhile menial unskilled labor jobs are on the decline, there is a growing need for skilled labor. Dental hygienists can earn an average of $69,280. An executive chef can make $59,743. Plumbers, electricians, and brick masons can all earn $45,000 or more. \n\nFor those of you who are thinking about becoming teachers and for those of you who are burning out as core academic teachers, you might want to consider becoming a Career and Technical Education instructor. Many states offer alternative certification routes for CTE teachers. I myself used my degree in Culinary Arts and my food service experience to leverage CTE certification in Culinary Arts. Given my work experience, I could most likely have gotten a 2nd endorsement as a business teacher (though I chose not to do this because I prefer Culinary Arts.\n\nAs a side note, I will also mention that as a Culinary Arts teacher, I am earning more than the average executive chef AND I don't have to work the long hours that are common in the food service industry. I think I have the best of both worlds. I get to work with food and I don't have to teach to the test.",

If any of you have experience with this process, I'd greatly appreciate your input. Before I get into that, here's some background:\n\nI received a MA in English, and have been working in the industry for about 5 years. I've been working for a university, where I was hired as a technical writer. My skills are in editing, professional writing, and content management, but my work wants me to do a bunch of social media stuff that I really hate doing. I've been doing less writing and editing, and more \"marketing.\" More recent work issues have begun to make me strongly feel that I need to make a career switch.\n\nI enjoy writing, and I love literature. I student taught a freshman-level writing class back in my undergraduate days, and recently I taught Sunday school for a year. I received a lot of complements on my teaching, and recently discovered that I might actually enjoy doing it for a living. I am interested in being certified to teach secondary education in Idaho or Utah.\n\nThis brings me to my questions.\n\n1. Can I be employed in secondary school in Idaho before I complete the ABCTE program with a Master's degree?\n3. What is the program like? Could I do it while also working 40 hours/week? Do you have any advice for someone like me? How long do you think it will take? \n4. It looks like there's a \"Professional Teaching Knowledge (PTK)\" exam and a Subject matter exam, in my case the \"American Board English Language Arts exam. Can you give me some insight into what topics are covered in both exams? How hard are they? I'm also 5 years out of college, so I'm worried I might have forgotten a lot. \n5. Is this the only/best option for receiving my teaching certificate at this point? I don't think I have the financial stability to quit my job and return to college full time. Are there alternatives to the ABCTE?\n6. It looks like the ABCTE cost is about $1900. Is there any \"financial aid\" (for lack of a better term) to help me pay for this?\n7. It looks like once I complete the program, I need to renew my certifications every few years? Can someone help me understand the process post-program?\n2. If I do complete the ABCTE certification, do I also then have to do the Praxis test?\n\nThanks guys. If I do decide to start this program it's going to mean a lot of late, late nights ahead of me for the next little while. I'd like to get a real handle on what's in store. Thanks in advance!",

    "text": "The New Dilemma: Choosing a Regionally Accredited and Less Expensive For-Profit University for a Master's in Educational Administration I've read several posts concerning why to avoid for-profit colleges. However, the game seems to be changing. There are two major reasons typically posited to avoid for-profit colleges: lack of regional accreditation and higher costs. However, the game seems to have changed. There are now regionally accredited for-profit colleges that are less expensive than traditional universities.\n\nI was enrolled in the University of North Florida's Master's in Educational Leadership program because the program allowed me to use the state tuition reimbursement waiver to cover my cost of the tuition. In other words, I was going to a state school for free-- a no brainer. However, they changed their position on allowing public school teachers to use the waiver. For me to complete my degree, it would cost $18,000. I could transfer to UWF and finish for $11,000. However, my principal suggested the American College of Education where I could finish for $6900 after a 500 dollar credit and transferring my one class. It's a for-profit, regionally accredited, TEAC accredited (NCATE and TEAC have merged so I think this is a non-issue now) school. It prepares me for my FELE exam just like UNF and everyone within the DCPS district have told me where I get this degree from doesn't matter as long as I pass the FELE.\n\nI hate debt. I have no debt. Even on a teacher salary, I can manage $6900. 11k and 18k on the other hand are significantly more to pay for on a teacher's salary. Yet, the damn stigma of my highest degree being from a school called ACE kills me.\n\nGiven the information I provided, particularly because I can get an accredited degree for significantly less than I could from a public university, what do you think?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r5cxowb95mb21.jpg?width=260&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7af887aac2ede2bc4fa26fc6573a834c0bcde4a",

I’ll google, cheat, or discuss with my elbow neighbor to make sure that I have the correct answers and pray that this is one of the assignments that we turn in for a grade so I can pass this class with as little effort as possible - It’s World History, so I shouldn’t have to put that much effort in to begin with.\n\n\nWhen I first stepped into the secondary education program at my school, I quickly found out about my professor being the individual over the secondary ed program. \nHis RMP reviews basically say this, and I’m in full agreement with them: “I’ve never seen someone spend so much effort to passively aggressively say, in the most words and shortest time: “F*** off.”.\nA classmate and I do some research and these years of experience he touted at a low-performing and low-income school happened to be at a middle-class suburban neighborhood in a well-off neighborhood before leaving 3 years later to work as a grad assistant at a D1 football school. (I guess that “most teachers leave within the first 3 years of the profession due to classroom management” hit a little too close to home for him).\n\nAnyway... back to my little rant\nThe first thing that was spoken about in the secondary education program was the American public school model versus the Finland school model. For those that aren’t familiar, Finland performs better than Americans for a variety of reasons (social safety nets, smaller populations, teachers held in higher regard, etc.). The video I watched on Youtube conceding it basically say that they have no homework and that the learning takes place in the classroom. It gives them time to enjoy their youth and all. \nFast forward a year later, and I’m student teaching. My observer, a completely different person, gives me 3 out of 4 on most of the stuff (expected and standard). The only thing that he’s given me 2s on is classroom management and time management. When I speak with him in the hallway he literally states that “Teachers walk out of the building exhausted and students are skipping, running, and excited to leave. It should be the other way around because the students are so tired of the higher level thinking required.”\n\n\nARE YOU JOKING?! They’re 13-18 years old! If it weren’t for the laws that arrested their parents, and possibly them, 75% wouldn’t even be here. This swinging pendulum of standardized testing versus actual learning is enough to make a person sick.",

    "text": "\"Must-Read\" books for teachers Hi everyone,\n\nJust wondering what 'teacher books' you guys can recommend me - particularly for primary school (elementary school) teachers. Whenever I look it up online the books sound great. Books like *Teach Like a Pirate*, *Teach Like a Champion*, *The Curious Classroom, What School Could Be* are titles I have seen pop up regularly, as well as Behaviour Management focused books such as *See Me After Class,* *The First Days of School* and *Conscious Discipline.*\n\nAlthough most of these have an American context, and I am an Australian teacher, they all sound interesting and potentially beneficial.\n\nWhat books would you say are a \"must-read\" or helped you improve your teaching?",

    "text": "Thinking of quitting dream job because of toxic managers; can't win for losing. Any advice or insight? **TLDR: I had a successful event recently, but no good feedback from any of my toxic management. Management only talks to me when I've done something wrong and I'm reaching my last straw.  I originally wanted a raise, but now I'm thinking of leaving my dream job at this toxic workplace. What would you do?**\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI'm a woman working in a toxic, male-dominated industry at an American company in Japan. Cool, famous company with big name-recognition; awful awful working environment.\n\nTo give an example of what I'm working with, the territory manager is a cold Japanese guy (let's call him Tanaka) who feeds on negative energy and my direct lead is a misogynist narcissistic American (let's call him Jimbo) who has really adapted to the Japanese culture of not being PC at all. He also has an awful temper, talks negatively about everything and everyone and will straight up ignore you if you're below him and he's mad at you or if he's wanting to feel important.\n\nJimbo's made jokes about cheating on his girlfriend, he's made multiple people in the office cry with his outbursts, he's belittled my ideas and then taken them to HQ without me in the discussion. When I asked him about why he did that, he gaslit me and said I remembered it wrong. He's done so much more, but I will leave it at that for now. Tanaka feeds off of Jimbo's energy and has given a lot of clout to Jimbo for his seniority and knowledge.\n\nUntil now, I've been trying to get through and biting my tongue because it's a dream job at a dream company with great benefits. I'm also trying to make it 6 more months before leaving so it doesn't look bad on my resume. However, a recent incident has my blood boiling, and I think I'm at my last straw.\n\nI have been in charge of an event that takes six months of prep. This is the first time I've been fully in charge. We had record-breaking numbers and turnout for the event. Another team was involved in getting speakers for the event.\n\nI was giving updates to Tanaka about the numbers, especially when we passed landmarks. I was expecting a pat on the back or something (he did that for the last person who was completely in charge) but I only got silence from him. I was a bit annoyed at this because he's quick to give negative feedback, so I was hoping for him to finally say something nice...\n\nAt the afterparty of the event, Jimbo pulls me aside and says, \"Good job on this event BUT you need to be giving more credit to people. The admin manager (gossipy JP woman) told me you've been taking all the credit\". I was shocked and hurt by this because I had never said this success was only because of myself. I was also increasingly annoyed because Jimbo frequently calls himself the \"One-man team\".\n\nI didn't want to think the team thought I was taking all the credit so I immediately tried to rectify this by thanking everybody for their hard work. I said I couldn't do the event alone, and I also got some nice sweets for everyone. I also wrote HQ with giving the team clear credit for their work, and HQ wrote back saying we did an amazing job (nicest feedback I had gotten that far; was in tears when reading it).\n\nIn the end, I couldn't get any positive feedback without a \"but\". The territory manager has been colder to me than usual (I have also been noticeably quieter/standoffish than usual for sure and Japanese people are the most passive aggressive people on Earth).The general admin lady has barely talked to me for the past few weeks which has been awful because she was usually nice to me.\n\nI was going to ask for a raise but the territory manager is so mean-spirited. I'm getting to the point of wanting to leave my dream job. These people have been so awful. I would like to try and work at HQ, but I have had absolutely no success in finding any advocates for me there. I feel like I should talk to Tanaka and see why he's mad at me, but direct confrontation doesn't always work in Japan, and I'm tired of apologizing to these grade A assholes.\n\nMisc. info; we recently had reviews for everyone. I was quite honest (while being hopefully professional and leaving anecdotes out of the reviews). People haven't received their reviews yet and the hammer's coming down on me probably early next week...\n\nI feel depressed and helpless. The most interesting thing about me is this job and I don't know what I would do after this...\n\nAny advice?\n\nEdit: Thank you guys for all the kind words and advice. I'm putting my resume together now.",

    "text": "Should I get out of Showbiz? Been working all my life attempting to get into a decent job in the entertainment industry and I've finally got into my dream job, I'm better at this job then i have been at anything else in my life. \n\n the pay is around £24k, ($30k) Which my wife and I make work. She makes more than me, which is the only reason we can afford London. It's tight and every month and we're no closer to paying off her American student debts or putting away savings, plus her job is also stressful and is keeping her away from what she wants to do with her life. \n\nFor the last two years that I've been with the company I've been told that I'm working towards a promotion with a sizable pay increase so I've gone all out in my attemps to secure this, staying late, working weekends, taking all the jobs nobody wanted to do, and on contracts I've put literally tens of thousands of pounds on the table for the company beyond what I'm supposed to do. My work/life has only damaged my relationship with my wife but I've been promising her it'll all be worth it. \n\nMy line manager said she has been in constant conversation with our head of department over the last two years, discussing my hard work with them and wished me luck for my promotion meeting with the department head. \n\nI had the promotion meeting and fuck me it was a woozy. We kicked off with being told that I'm great at my job but because this job is 'fun', that I'm easily replaced, that some people \"pump shit for a living\", and they've created a new promotion structure,  I'm not getting a promotion until next year where I'll be put on a 6 month long training course, and after that I'll get maybe a increase of 3k.\n\nThe dumbest thing about this is that I'm effectively doing the promoted job already and the new structure seems to be a company wide policy to fuck with the majority of the workers who are due a promotion and have been for awhile. Technically, going by my job title, im still just an assistant. \n\nI was then told he only way I would ever get a decent salary is if i bring in a whale (think talent who can make over 100k for the company) which is an incredibly sizeable ask and it feels like im having the goalposts moved from under me. \n\nI was also told i need to exercise because 'I looked like someone who doesn't'. \n\nSafe to say this has totally knocked the wind out of my sails and I've found it near impossible to focus at work. I've been looking at jobs in other industries but im not even sure if i can move across with how specific my skill set is. Should I stay the course and keep working for another few years and hope that I move up the corporate ladder? Is two years too soon in the corporate world? I don't have anyone to talk to about things and I'm feeling trapped. Has anyone been through something similar.",

I’ve been self-employed since I was 19, with the exception of a few part times gigs here and there, and I’ve hit a breaking point\n\nWith the help of an academic scholarship, I completed my Bachelor's degree in 2015 in Communications and Media. I was an excellent student in high school, and knew that I wanted to continue my education, but was struggling with various undiagnosed mental health conditions and didn’t fully understand how college “worked,” or what I wanted to do specifically. My entire college experience was one of survival. I just wanted to get my degree and move on. I found counselors and advisors to be extremely unsupportive. I knew I wanted a creative, unconventional career and life in general, but didn’t want to pigeon hole myself into one area and felt quite lost throughout college.  \n\nI nannied throughout college to pay my rent, worked a few customer service and sales/retail-oriented jobs. I fell into art modeling, extra work on tv and film, and occasional print and runway modeling gigs. \n\nI started progressing slowly in entertainment and worked as a stand-in, got featured roles and even a few principal roles in commercials. \n\nI started working as a brand ambassador for experiential marketing agencies. I also work as a guest speaker for a mental health non-profit and share my life story to help spread the word on mental health to end stigma. \n\nI feel like I’ve only ever dipped my toes in things. I have little to no savings (3,000 currently) but no debt, and a solid credit score (780+)  I’m told over and over again that I’m not in a bad place, but I feel stupid, unaccomplished and frustrated. \n\nI’d love to consider having a youtube channel, a podcast, perhaps even continuing acting…but I feel like an imposter and know these things will have to be hobbies that may not grow into stable sources of income. My degree gave me the flexibility to explore various electives, but I think I look unemployable to most folks because I don’t have a “thing.” \n\nI also have over a decade of vocal training and theory. I miss singing and dancing. It was a regular part of my childhood. \n\nI’m told that having a stable 9-5 would help me manage my mental health conditions, and give me a sense of financial security. I also feel that I wasted most of my early youth focusing on getting good grades in subjects I could care less about, and don’t want to become someone that comes home and does nothing after work to “unwind” from the mindless, desk job bullshit I’d do.\n\nI’m aware that I CAN find a 9-5 that works for me, save money, and still have it in me to work on my own projects…but I don’t wholeheartedly BELIEVE I can. I don’t understand most job postings, let alone the descriptions and job titles accompanying them, and the idea of making a choice terrifies me. I’ve only ever known survival and gig-based work. \n\nI feel an insurmountable shame and guilt. My parents want to see me happy and successful and tell me that I am choosing a life of hardship over something stable. \n\nI don’t trust my ability to make decisions anymore.\n\nI acknowledge that this is strange, and I’ve attempted to shove my lift into some sort of box for people to open and unravel. \n\nI want to attach my resume but it appears that I can't on this thread? \n\nAny advice would be appreciated.",

Also, it would be a new challenge and i think i have hit a glass ceiling and cannot go up (in position, not salary) because im not from \"x\" country (in this region, every leader position is concentrated in one country, im not from that country) meanwhile, Honeywell Region HQ are in my country which will also help me to access an upper position easier. \n\n  \nbenefits are very similar in both companies, to not say the same, and culture i guess its also mostly the same given they are both american companies in the same industries.

    "text": "Arts administrator considering career change - where do you go when your experience is so niche? I'm an arts administrator for a large ballet company looking to make a career change, but I have no idea what would suit my unusual and very niche skillset. I'm currently a full-time Company Manager, which means I'm responsible for making sure 40-65 professional ballerinas have all the support they need to give their best performances: managing schedule information; dealing with sick leave, complaints, soft-HR stuff; managing internal communications (a lot of emails, briefings, tour information booklets, etc.) It's a desk job, but one which needs a lot of industry knowledge. I'm scared because my whole career has been in the arts - I have a Bachelor of Theatre Arts (Management) and have never worked outside the industry. I want to make a change because funding is severely limited and while my job is secure, I'm never going to make even the national median wage, let alone enough for financial independence like my wife and I want. I love what I do, but it's a 24/7 kind of job due to how we work and nobody gets paid enough for the stress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKey skills are: project planning, project management, creating/managing schedules, budgets and drafting contracts. Some HR skills, but it's not something I want to do for a job. Strong written and verbal communication skills necessary due to large number of people I'm working with each day. Have an expert-level understanding of the arts & culture industry, with career experience in non-profit and/or government-funded organisations (no private sector experience.)  I have worked in events management before. Some experience hiring and firing. Interests outside of work are being outdoors, working with young people (I'm a volunteer Scout leader), and books. What would you recommend?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've also got experience in showcalling, which is managing all the lighting/sound/automation/cast/crew cues and movement on stage, live as the show happens over radio comms: I've been told I should consider air traffic control because of this - it's a hectic role where you're giving dozens of instructions per minute to a) keep everyone safe and b) keep the show running. Getting it wrong can result in a bad audience experience or someone getting killed if it really goes bad. Have also been told 911/emergency services dispatch would suit this kind of skill, but have heard that burnout rate is high. Anyone know of any jobs that require this kind of situational management experience?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently living in Australia, but American advice is usually quite relevant here! I would strongly consider going back and doing a masters degree to help with the change - so feel free to suggest. Also feel free to ask me anything about my current job! It's an awesome thing to do.

Luckily (I guess?), there are several sports and other fashion related brand headquarters are based in the city that I am living in. But they are not luxury.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I roughly concluded that I have two choices, for now, one is working as a sales associate for a luxury brand and the other one is working in one of the headquarters that are based in my city. BUT, I don’t know if my anticipations are on point. Although I've been working quite a bit, I don’t expect me to start working as a manager or supervisor. And if I have to, I am willing to start as an entry-level employee. And among two choices, I want to choose the opportunity that will get me to a position that is similar to my previous job, a buyer/merchandiser. YES, I want to end up doing what I did before eventually.\n\nI summarized pros/cons, some details about my situations, and questions regarding two of my plans in the below. It would be really helpful if anyone would give me any advice or related information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Working as a sales associate (luxury brand):\n\n\\- (+) I feel confident about the luxury industry than other fields.\n\n\\- (+) I think I can gain some good information on the US market and customer behavior\n\n\\- (+) A part-time job is available, so I can start the job with less pressure and commitment.\n\n\\- (-) I don’t have any sales experience. I used to work on the floor when I was working for a department store company. So I, kind of, witnessed everything. And I had to help them whenever it gets really busy and needs some help. But still, no sales experience.\n\n\\- (+) I am bilingual.\n\n\\- (-) My English is not perfect. ( but I believe it will get better over time with some effort :) )\n\n\\- (?) I don’t know if it is the case in the US but back in my home country, there is some sort of invisible boundary between sales & office work. Is it hard to make a transition to office work later on? Because there is a possibility that I will move to NYC. And I want to make sure working in a boutique is not a negative work experience.\n\n\\- (?) I am also curious about the pay. How much can I make?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Working in a headquarter (ex. American sports or shoe brand):\n\n\\- (+) I am more comfortable with office work and office environment.\n\n\\- (+ & ?) Maybe I will get paid more?\n\n\\- (+ & ?) Most of the companies are global brand companies and I am bilingual so, maybe, I can have a position that involves with merchandising and global business???\n\n\\- (-) Again, my English is not perfect. ( but I believe it will get better over time with some effort :) )\n\n\\- (?) It seems like there are distinct differences in what employees do for this kind of companies. Because luxury retails are mostly European and involves in importation while sports or shoe companies(available in my city) are a domestic company that involves in manufacturing. Do I get this right? Or no?\n\n\\- (?) I eventually end up in a luxury field. Is it hard to make a transition to the luxury industry?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for reading and your time.",

    "text": "How do I deal with a \"Rockstar\" developer on my team? Hey guys, I'm a contract developer at a fairly large American company\n\nI joined about 4 months ago as a frontend react developer. My experience is as a full stack developer and I'm equally capable in the backend, but for this role my main task is the GUI.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar, a data lake is a fairly new data warehouse paradigm where unstructured data (Think device logs, and social media posts) are streamed into storage and made available for querying like a traditional database. It's a data warehouse architecture created to handle the absolutely massive amounts of analytics information that modern companies are generating.\n\nThis is a fairly new warehouse architecture, and as a result, there is not an extremely clear roadmap for how these things are to be implemented.\n\nThis gets into the particular issue I'm having. Our lead developer built the backend of this project almost entirely by himself. ALL of the business logic of the application is basically stored in his head. There is documentation, but the documentation is still somewhat esoteric and hard to make sense of.\n\nThis results in the lead developer still performing 99% of the work on the project. I recently was able to contribute a small amount of code to the backend. This was a minor backend task which I could have completed in 1-2 days if I knew the business requirements, but I didn't. I would be able to work for 2-3 hours and then would have to ask the lead for clarification, and the lead is so busy that I can hardly get him to clarify even minor things.\n\nThis situation gives me the appearance of being a less effective developer to my manager, who has over the last several weeks, in minor ways, seemingly lowered his opinion of my abilities. The other day \"explained\" to me what a feature branch is even though I've consistently pushed my code to feature branches for months.\n\nAny thoughts or advice on how to deal with this? I'm kinda of bored and frustrated at work, because I can't work on anything with my normal effectiveness because I have to ask our lead developer for clarification on his vision of what the app is supposed to be constantly. I find myself mindlessly browsing the news for hours a day.\n\nThanks for any advice you can give.",

    "text": "My successful entry level job search: Some tips and anecdotes from someone whose GPA was closer to 2 than 3. First some background: I graduated from Virginia Tech with a degree in CS in 2018. My GPA was about a 2.4 due to some particularly bad stuff that happened my senior years (took me five years as a result). As a result of this stuff, I was unable to finish my internship that I had started Junior year and lost the job that I had lined up. \n\nAfter graduating, I spent six months just enjoying myself and just taking a break. Working on my mental health and working on my physical health cause I gained about 100 pounds while in college. \n\nIt took me about four months to find a job after the fall of 2018 to relax. During that time, I made a point of going to every company that talked to me but didn't send me an offer asking what they recommended I do to improve my resume. The following is a collaboration of the ones that I heard consistently with the people I was talking to. \n\nFirst thing. Don't look exclusively at the big companies. If you want a job at Google or Amazon, go right ahead and go for it. But there's nothing wrong with starting at start-ups and smaller operations. You're not any less of a software engineer because you're not at Google. I didn't even look at most of them personally because I didn't feel confident with my GPA being as low as it was. \n\nI focused mainly on companies with a hardware component. I had worked on a build team in college so I had some skills with hardware integration that I knew a lot of programmers did not have or even have the basics for. The company I ended up finding had a strong emphasis on hardware integration and my hiring manager was very clear that my passion on that subject got me the job. I'd recommend anyone, regardless of GPA, consider this approach. You know you're the best at something, something that you love and could talk for days about. Steer the conversation to that. \n\nThe resume: My self esteem wasn't great during this process because I knew I had a big weight around my ankle with my GPA and was afraid of ever letting it get through. The advice I got was to keep it off your resume and to just let them ask, regardless of GPA. If your GPA isn't fantastic, they'll ask why and you'll have the opportunity to explain what went wrong. If it is fantastic, you get a free boost in their eyes and a natural opportunity to steer the conversation to the classes that you rocked. My other advice is to remember what the resume is for. You're probably not getting hired off your resume, your resume and your cover letter are for getting you in the door. Your resume should be able to naturally lead your interviewers to ask questions about the things on there. Setting up your resume so that in the resume, you get to show that passion talked about earlier is highly important. \n\nOn a note about the GPA and just issues in general. If you're like me and had some bad stuff happen, the advice I consistently got was to mention it but don't dwell on it. Talk about what strides you made to improve from that point. It could an incredibly tiny stride but its still important. \n\nThe last thing I heard consistently was that standing out was important. I talked earlier about passion and finding that one thing you can wax eloquently on. That doesn't have to be just in coding. If you were a member of a team in college or volunteer for something that you're passionate about, put it on your resume or find a way to bring it up because its important. A lot of programmer resumes read as one dimensional. They know how to program and thats all they know. Add another dimension to your resume. Worse case scenario, it never comes up. Best case, your passion shows them you have a lot to bring to the table. \n\nThink that about covers everything. Remember for anyone reading this that I am not a hiring manager. This is just based off what I saw work in my search and what the managers I talked to said works. In the end of my search, I ended up with four job offers from four wildly different companies. All four of them knew my GPA when they made those offers and all four overlooked it. \n\nSo **TL:DR**\n\nPassion is important and impressive. Construct as many ways as possible to interject passion into your interviews. \n\nYour resume exists to get you into the door. Treat it you would an advertisement. You want them to click to learn more not close it. \n\nRegardless of your GPA, there is value in not having it on your resume if it is not absolutely required. Most if not all companies will ask you what it was and you can bank on that opportunity and maximize the impact of your answer. \n\n\n\nFinally a note to those other CS majors and engineers who graduated college in less than ideal circumstances. Be it a mediocre GPA, a less than top tier program, whatever it may be. Remember that you graduated. You accomplished something that only 30% of Americans have done. You are no less than of a programmer or an engineer than the person who graduated first in their class from Stanford. Searching for a job is harder for some than others. They're out there. You'll find one.",

I know you're not supposed to let your environment affect you, but I've really been feeling drained as of late. I work at a big N but at a department that is heavily compromised of body shop workers from consultancies like Infosys, WiPro, Cognizant, Tata, etc.\n\nSome of the folks I've worked with from these consulting agencies have been great and friendly people but I can't help but feel like I'm not really part of a prestigious group at this company. Almost all the upper level managers here have come from these consulting agencies and pretty much run the place. Time and time again if you've read through posts here and on Blind, you've seen the horrible rep these guys get, and that's just putting it nicely. And it's true...thick politics, \"throw as many contractors as you can\" at a problem is always the solution, low budgeted projects across the board, and a lot of people speaking in Hindi around here. Many whisper to each other because of fear of getting deported if they say something \"wrong\". A lot of favoritism. A lot of treating these people like expendable commodities. They're not even treated like human beings. If you're American-born, you're a minority here.\n\n\nJust wondering if anyone's been in this peculiar situation as I have been. I don't even really feel like a respected engineer really, I feel like I've become like these guys and that I have to speak Hindi to even fit in. I know leaving the company is the only option at this point, and I've been trying, but I feel drained every day having to work 9-5 then go home and work again in the evenings, just to manage the same consultants offshore. Mustering up the confidence and performing well in interviews hasn't gone well. Grinding leetcode with the little amount of time I have has been difficult. All of this has really been a hit to my ego and mental state and I feel like I've been going crazy. No sleep. \"Out of body\" experiences at work, looking at myself, asking what am I doing here. No I'm not doing drugs, but it's that feeling of extreme hopelessness. \n\nI really want to just quit take a break from all of this, but...I just dont know what to do anymore. I feel like I've thrown my career out the window by not doing meaningful work, by effectively being a consultant manager instead of an actual contributor. What to do...",

I would like some opinions from anyone who have worked at either of these companies or have any information on them. I was offered a fullstack role from Amex, which I feel is a great skill, especially when changing careers, since a lot of companies are attracted to hire fullstack engineers, and perhaps it leads to a more clear path to one day move into management or a lead position. Also, American Express was very open about me changing teams if I ever wanted. I'm not sure how easy that actually is. \n\nOn the other hand, VISA offered me slightly more money, but in Foster City CA. That is by the San Francisco Bay Area and apparently a very very expensive place to live. Once cost of living is factored in, both offers are financially similar. I've read a lot about the Bay Area and Foster City recently, and people seem to not like it. It's expensive, very uniform in how everyone is either in the Tech industry or servicing it (I'd rather live in a more diverse city and meet people of other professions too). Also, the role that VISA offered me is a software engineer, working in Java (Backend). This aligns more with my interests but it seems less flexible as a career compared to fullstack. \n\nBoth companies seem to have a good work-life balance. I know a lot of people have shit on both companies on this reddit, but keep in mind that these are the two offers and I need to choose one. From what I've read, AMEX is moving towards using newer technologies such as React, while VISA seems to historically have a better reputation when it comes to tech, and rely less on older tech stacks.",

UPDATE: The Company works in a distributed manner, there is no office, All teams and their members work remotely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackground: A soon to graduate student living in India\n\n**(TLDR; < See the list at the end> )**\n\nGood Evening,\n\nI am to graduate this year. All of the three startups that I worked for have offered me a decent enoughrole and compensation for the role of an SDE (High paying from an Indian Perspective) .\n\nMy experience has not been very good emotionally working for Indian Companies. I have been hurt, indignated (To be fair, There were some who have stood up for me against their management) as well as I have noticed an amount of social relegation for my humbler academic pedigree.\n\nRecently I have joined an American organization (I was recommended by someone) where I have been offered a role upfront when I am interning, They pay me more than their competitions in India by a huge margin. The people here are respectful and I feel at home (probably because I felt like I had no team belonging in my last organization which hurt me a lot, I felt like I was a scripting Intern \\[Even when I was an Engineering Intern in my Offer Letter I was assigned as a coder help to a non tech department - A Different Division. One day the manager said I won't be reviewed because I wasn't in Engineering and that broke me because I felt that my time in the Organization didn't matter. I was eventually reviewed but ghosted\\] while other interns had clear mentors, teams and a sense of belonging I worked alone took every decision by myself and all people cared about was IO and none about code quality which I felt weird (rightly so) because at previous internships an Engineering Lead took reviews and monitored me, It feels like a contract in the name of an internship. I felt alone and cordoned in a place full of people. The only people who came up to me were the Engineering Project leads who thought I did a good job and offered me Projects which led me doing additional projects for other departments in hope to get noticed, these are also the people who stood up for me when my Internship was feared to be swept under the rug and I wasn't to be reviewed for my work and a job.\n\nAnd then I joined this American Org as a remote Intern and I feel more comfortable here and I love the people around. I feel respected.\n\nBut I don't know if I could survive working alone and I don't know how is it different than working in an office, I have had a history of mental illness. And I know if I don't maintain human contact for a while I will break down. Most of my friends are college friends.

    "text": "What's next as a senior engineer? I've been working professionally as a Rails and/or Clojure developer for about six years, and for the past year+ have been at a startup doing Rails. The work/team/business have all been fine, and I negotiated to work less hours (which is an important benefit to me).\n\nThe first ~10 devs were more experienced than I am, but most of them have since left and were recently replaced with more junior people. All of the remaining devs except me were just promoted into hybrid management-engineer roles. I have a performance review coming soon, but will continue as an IC—the company needs productive hackers, and the available management slots have been filled (NB: fine by me). So I'm trying to figure out what's next.\n\nI haven't been growing technically: we don't use any tech I haven't used a lot beforehand, and I don't want to come up with contrived projects just to learn, say, a new frontend framework. I've already put a lot of effort into understanding the business side of things, and have spent a year efficiently turning poorly-specced stories into working code (frequently collaborating with stakeholders in other departments). As the company matures, though, if anything my autonomy is decreasing (since now we have a proper product team, more process, etc.).\n\nOn the other side, though, it's not always so easy to find a startup with strong engineering practices and sensible business decisions (especially outside of the Bay Area), and I also really appreciate the schedule flexibility I have.\n\nA confounding variable is that I'm planning to move overseas to pursue a master's degree (in an unrelated field) next year, I believe I could keep my current job as a remote worker (and still have the time and energy to keep up with school), and—though I could get a local job there—American dev salaries seem to be the best.\n\nI talked to my brand new manager briefly and he said he'd have to get back to me.\n\nWhat do you recommend?",

    "text": "How to deal with managers that make your life hard even if you truly love your job Hello everyone,\n\nI would like to apologize because this is a throwaway account, but i truly need to get something off my chest.\n\nSo I work in the corporate world as an engineer in a rare niche sector of engineering. Natural gas, my job is to not make things go boom by doing some very precise work for gas processing plants.\n\nThis detail is only important because I want to emphasize that this kind of job is hard to find in this area of expertise and that's why it one of a kind and fun and interesting and so on...\n\nThe problem is, corruption, and it is not a joke when they say it is spreading like wildfire.   \n\nBeing an European and working in an EU office, in an American company, top management is obviously American but all bellow the hierarchy are locals and that is a big problem here, I will explain why.\n\nNepotism or hiring an acquaintance is very common and their are very open about this with no shame and no consequences and it seems no one cares as long as results are being produced. My direct manager is a woman my age with less experience in this field which found herself in a position of managing a team, basically overnight, only because she is the sister in-law of the operations manager. She is out of her league in every way, clueless and not even trying to understand anything...everyone around her is just a tool to build her resume and even if anyone says something or does something to point out a mistake she has the full backing of upper management.\n\nI am really at a loss for this, I don't know what to do. She is careful in making any mistake just because she avoids a straight answer, even the emails are carefully written in the sense that everything is a \"suggestion\" or you need to consult this, read that, talk to this person... the decision falls only on the person who she is relaying a half-order. In case it is executed well she takes credit but in case it is not the other person does.\n\nWe're about 20 engineers and 4 of them just quit, could not deal with the bullshit anymore. While others they became indifferent to the work, which is also affecting everyone because it was nice to speak with someone that had the same enthusiasm about problem solving and engineering work as you did. Now they just cant be bothered, it's just a do the work \"yes sir\" or \"consider it done\" attitude with minimum effort and I cant blame them.\n\nDue to circumstances about my living conditions, living in this town with my wife I truly have nowhere else to go unless I switch roles, but a new role would mean a start from 0 and all of years would be for nothing because my applied skills are no match in any other industry of engineering (well, like 90%).\n\nI refuse to believe that I'm powerless in this situation, what can I do? Has anyone dealt with this before before the \"\\*\\*\\* this shit I'm out\" attitude kicked in ?\n\nWonderful job, amazing projects, I feel like I'm making the world greener by learning about implemented new techs in these old polluting factories... I really dont want to call it quits.\n\nLooking forward to any kind of reply.",

    "text": "Resign or get fired as developer? Hello,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis might not be the first time someone asks this... I dont feel my case is special but due the overwhelming situation I thought about to take a second opinion... no better place than the internet to advice you, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy story...I moved from other country (USA) while I was working for an American IT giant ... came to work to a smaller company that offered me more freedom and I was going to \"touch\" more things than in well structured companies (pipelines, decisions about infrastructure, arquitectures, so on...)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story made short...  I was not able to fit in the team due I wanted to implement some things that according my experience would be better, faster and nicer...  but I never enforced anyone, only propossed. And made the mistake to comment about some spaghetti solutions (made by the senior developers)... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSolutions like:\n\nif true = false\n\nreturn true;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery time I talk with my manager where he asked how my on boarding was going on... I was surprised due I basically had no on boarding, I thought this might be normal since American companies have different on boarding (with documentation, team meetings and people explaining you how things work) and this company (Im in Europe now) is not like that..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy manager is not close of the team, is not present in the slack channel where we discuss and have our \"stand up\" meeting... or planning or anything, basically he gets the feedback from my teammates. (which at that point I didnt know)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, things went from bad to worse and 2 months after start he said will downgrade my salary since I was not what they expected, I ask too much and often require more time (I was the only one making QA at that time) since we dont have QA and few tests ... I was just afraid to release a bug and took my time... people told me is not necessary because after launch to production we can check logs and if something is wrong we can rollback.... (not my way of work). So, i got a smaller paycheck and i continue with my life...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCame some next projects and all went fine, later again I had to work with a guy (who was my team lead and I didnt know due my terrible onboarding) he asked me to do some library to convert some information and he will save it later in other service... I made it but made extra work than expected (some information was supposed to be avoided, I didnt know, I was new in the project) ... still I think was easy just to ignore the rest...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen my manager came with the new that it was terrible and I was on probation time due performance... for 3 weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI passed those 3 weeks fine and later he said will go on probation for another month  because he believed I had 3 weeks of \"luck\" .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe funny thing is that I first I used to received comments like \"this is an overkill\" this is \"a bad practice\" this is \"time consuming\" , \"what is this technology? we dont use it\" ... but on last months those \"overkills\" seems to be the \"best practice\" and those bad practices are \"the good practices\" now...  and of course, my \"team lead\" made it official through a document...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not saying he felt I was going after his position because no, I am not that good in know about the whole company process like him .. actually Im far away, but seems to me this was very ridiculous...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCame my last one on one with my manager and he said it was clear team don't want me and he will take decision after his holidays (that is in 2 weeks, April 29th... for me is a clear fired signal\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe good part: I already signed other job to start in June\n\nThe bad part: would be my first time I get fired  while I am used to do a great job and have great performance\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, here is the situation, if I quit, I will stay until 15 of May (then take 15 days of paid holidays) and start my new job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I get fired I get 3 months (and I believe plus holidays) of salary and I stay one month of holidays (or I could even start earlier my other job since they are waiting for me already)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut leaving in that way is a big stigma (at least in the USA) and Im not sure how good will look at my C.V. to be fired, plus the references and other possible future problems I can see...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this is my fault but I also feel is not 100%, for that reason I am sometimes planning to get fired just to make the company pay, but in other hand, it feels bad to end up like this...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat would be the best from the IT perspective? from European employers? or for my career?",

    "text": "Change from relatively comfortable job to a new startup **Current job**: I work for a medium-sized (\\~60 employees) remote-first startup since August 2018 (about 5 months). The job initially was more sales-related. Even though negotiations is still a big part of the role, I also spend my time doing data analysis (due my skills with Python, Excel and SQL), automating processes (also, due tech skills), finding solutions to improve the quality of the service of the company and even contributing to the company's code base. I really enjoy this variety of tasks, and to be honest, I enjoy more doing these other tasks than the sales/negotiations ones. \n\nThis is an North-American company, while I'm based in South America. So, in terms of compensation, it's quite low for USA-standards (around USD 16k/year). I'm also work as a contractor, which means, no social security or anything. My cost of living in my city is about USD12k/year (I live very frugally), so I can still save some money with my current salary.   \nOverall, I'm pretty happy with the job itself. The company culture is great, it's very horizontal, C-level guys are very accessible. Also, there is the unlimited-vacations policy and a very flexible working schedule. And the best of all: autonomy. ZERO micromanagement. I independently work on whatever I judge that can produce the best results to the company.\n\nA better salary wouldn't hurt though. Besides moving to a manager position, I don't see my salary growing in the future in my current position. It is reasonably easy to move horizontally to a developer position, get a bit of experience and have a growth in salary (and maybe job satisfaction as well, as I enjoy coding). Having experience as developer might give me chances to get another job in the future, which tends to be better paid as well.  \nNote: I'm 25 years old, and this is my first job after college (went to business school)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**For the future:** I have reasonably solid skills as developer and data analyst. I enjoy studying machine learning and web development. However, I have no professional experience, which puts me in a catch-22 situation to find a junior tech position. Having some development experience would be very helpful for my career in the future, and I can probably land a pretty good job with a much better pay. For instance, I consider USD40k-60k/year a very interesting salary and it doesn't seems to be that hard to achieve it with a couple years of development experience under the belt.   \nI might receive an offer from a small (also remote) startup (I'm going to be the 6th employee) to work as a Junior Fullstack Developer. The salary would be almost 50% higher (\\~USD24k/year). I would be the 4th member of the development team, which seems to be an amazing learning opportunity to get experienced with modern technologies and receive mentorship from more experienced developers.\n\nThat's seems to be very nice, at least in theory. It's impossible to know how the job will actually be in terms of company culture, work-life balance and general satisfaction (which is all pretty good in my current position).   \nThis startup is a remote position as well. As bonus point, one of the Senior Devs lives in my city, which means we might collaborate in person sometimes (that's neat). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt would be a risky change, but the benefits might be good as well. I consider myself well-liked in my current job, and I'd leave the company in good terms. However, I'm not sure if it would be possible to go back.  As I strongly prefer working remote, getting a third job in case this new one fails might not be possible very quickly. Also, a remote Junior Developer position is not easy to find as well, so it might be a good opportunity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI need some advice on this. Do you think this change worth it? If I stay in my current job, since I have tech skills and I'm doing several tasks that my other teammates cannot do by themselves, should I ask for a raise? What would you do in my place?  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

    "text": "Message/tips to the new interns who are going to start their internships at a B4 Hey all! I want to start off by congratulating the interns for getting their internships. I keep seeing people on this sub saying that the memes on this sub are scaring them and they don't know what to expect of their internship. NO NEED TO BE STRESSED OUT GUYS. The memes are real and sometimes even too real but complaining about B4's comes with the job. Just to reassure you guys, here are some tips to follow before your B4 internships/busy seasons. \n\nTips:\n\n- ASK QUESTIONS. I can't put enough emphasis on this point. You are new. We expect you to ask questions. We don't expect you to understand most of the crap that you will be doing on a daily basis. We have all been interns. We all know what being an intern is like. We all know how lost interns are. ASK MANY QUESTIONS. \n\n- Take notes. This is more important than asking questions. The staff, seniors, managers, etc will gladly answer all of your questions and explain you 2,3,4 times the process or what to do. Overall, most of your coworkers are extremely patient. However, if they have to repeat the same thing 12 times, they will start getting a little more angry than usual. Keep a notebook and note everything.\n\n- Before asking questions, look at the prior year workbooks. About 75% of the time, the answer to one of your questions is answered in the workbook.\n\n- Always stay positive. Some workdays are going to be extremely long I won't lie to yall. But a negative person on the team affects team moral and then everybody is in a bad mood. \n\n- You are going to hear constant complaining by employees about the work culture regarding B4. I have many colleagues that actually enjoy the work culture around B4 and enjoy auditing. Don't let yourself be influenced by others so easily. Do the work, and if you don't like it then you can complain as much as you want.\n\n- Feel out the vibe of your team. Some teams prefer working long hours in the beginning and then having a more relaxed ending. Some are the opposite. Feel the vibe and go at their pace.\n\nRegarding the long hours:\nI won't lie, working at a B4 is long hours. However, in my experience, the team usually sends that interns home much earlier because they are not much help at a certain point. Working at a North American B4, my intern busy season consisted of 47-52 hours per week. Now this depends entirely on your team and your mandates. Some mandates you will work much much more. So I guess there is some luck in the equation.\n\nONE MORE TIME, you are interns. You don't know what you're doing. We know that, we appreciate you trying. We have all been where you are and we have all been nervous at first. NO NEED TO STRESS MORE THAN USUAL.\n\nWell these are a few tips before you start. Know that you guys can always send me a message about anything regarding your internships and I'll try to help you out. I really hope you guys enjoy the experience as much as I have. Good luck ladies and gents!",

    "text": "10% of Gross Tips Deducted Every Check for Processing Fees and Credit Card Fees I have 0 background in any level of finance so bear with me. Employees of a small business in Missouri, paid hourly wage above minimum state requirement for services, recieve some tips in cash and majority of tips via credit card paid bi weekly on paycheck. \n\nIt recently came to my attention that 10% of total CC tips are deducted pre tax from each employee every pay period. I asked the company General Manager who runs payroll and was informed it is for processing fees and credit card fees. It is a legal practice for MO employers to deduct the expense from employee's pre-tax tips. After a 2 hr Google session (whips out Google Tax Expert Degree) it is my understanding that employers may only deduct exactly what they pay out. \n\nMy questions are, may I ask for a copy of their merchant account company's statement so I can see what structure is used and payment process fees applied, or if that is inappropriate/confidential what questions should I be asking to understand whether or not 10% per pay period per employee is a fair practice? Also, if a business can report process fees for tax purposes and that business chooses to pass those expenses off to employees to pay, do employees then have a right to request tax forms proving the 10% per pay period?\n\nI could be completely off base here but 10% sounded steep after running some cave man numbers using average transaction percentages and surcharges. Personally, as a mother of 3 every .01 counts. Tips via CC make up half of my net income after taxes and the horrendous health ins plan (-465.18 from every check).

    "text": "Help! I need advice - should I stay or should I go? (Public to Industry/Govt) Recently I've gone through some soul searching with whether or not I should stay in public accounting or should I try something different. I've been working in public accounting full time for 5 years (1.5 at one firm, 3.5 at my current place). I am a CPA (2 years post-designation) and I am almost of the level of making manager. I work in an American city of about 400,000 and I live about 35 minutes from the office by car. I gross about $43,500. I have the feeling that I am underpaid considering I am 2 years post-CPA designation.\n\nNow, some context of the firm that I currently work at, it's a one office 50 people firm (quite a few people in the age range of 20-40 which is nice because there are people around my age). We do anything from a Notice-To-Reader to an Audit to personal/corporate tax returns.\n\nFor the environment of the firm, imagine if jocks/bros were accountants, that's the sort of environment that it is (at least the guys are definitely jocks - talking about sports 95% of the time). There's a boy's club in the office but just because I am a boy doesn't make me a part of their club. I do want to desperately be a part of the boy's club but I'm not sure if I ever will. A bunch of my co-workers and I did a weekend to a local ski place which was nice but I don't think I really added anything special other than being there. I've been trying to get better at golf since most of the guys and 90% of the partners are members at the local country club (but I am in no financial position to ever afford a membership).  I invited people from the office to my wedding as like a sign of my friendship to them but the relationships haven't grown at all since then. Actually, the youngest partner called me \"a fucking pussy\" a few months after the wedding just because I said I missed my wife while she was gone on a business trip. Granted, he's a little rough around the edges but that isn't what a partner should ever say to an employee (especially up until that moment, I had looked up to him and had him at my wedding).\n\nOne of the things that bothers me the most is that they are inconsistent in their attitudes toward me. I mean, individually, they are all fine and dandy but when there's more people around, they all can aggressively tease me at times (and others). They are the sort of people that make fun of anything that's different and they are willing to make a joke at my or someone else's expense if it makes other people laugh. This environment is created at the point by some of the partners. For me, it can be really frustrating when someone that you think you have a reasonable relationship with, makes fun of me in the presence of others. If you're a jerk to me, fine. If you're nice to me, that's also fine. But at least be consistent about it. I know that co-workers aren't your friends, they are just people who work at the same place you do. But it would be nice if they were.\n\nPart of me also wants to leave is that I hate how public accounting can be a bit of a shark tank in terms of billing hours and how it's important to get the most (or at least close to it) and it's a constant struggle. Especially with tax season/doing tax returns and how much overtime is put in with not much benefit to me. I know that it's only a few months and then it's easier after that. But to get there can be brutal. My newly-wed wife has commented that at her local college job, every overtime hour that she works, she gets an hour in-lieu. I laughed in her face when she asked why wasn't public accounting the same.\n\nMy wife and I do not have any kids yet but we plan for some in the future. She has suggested in the past that I could apply there. On the surface, it might be a good idea. Higher pay, less working hours, benefits, less stressful environment (in theory). The only question is if I would be bored working there after a while. With Public Accounting, I will say that I am getting bored of Notice-To-Reader/Compilation Engagements and I find running Audits to be very stressful sometimes.\n\nThe problem with looking at other jobs is that I have this crippling doubt of if I will be able to perform in another job. It seems silly but I have historically struggled with self-confidence at work but it's gotten better as I work more. I've been in the workplace of public accounting since 2009 (with internships at various firms, unemployment and now full time employment). Simply put, it's all I've ever known. I'm sure I could get most jobs if I applied for them, assuming they were within my skill set.\n\nI was told by a senior manager at my firm who has been in industry before and came back to public accounting: It's not greener on the other side. He cited he's worked in industry and a government institution and they weren't great places to work either. He cited the lack of flexibility in terms of working hours at the other places, the responsibility factor/no one does your work other than you and the office politics being a huge thing which was very annoying. I believe his sincerity but I also know that a lot of my classmates in college went to industry as soon as they got their CPA.\n\nI know I've been negative about the firm I work at. There are good people who work there and I do enjoy working with some of them. No job is perfect, there have good days and bad jobs and every job is hard in some way. You jut have to find the one that you can put up with for the rest of your life.\n\nAny advice?",

    "text": "Airline Loyalty Help Classic consultant post, I know. So I’ll be joining a major consulting firm in Miami in about a month. I’m trying to decide which airline I should stick to, but I’m really between two choices:\n\n1. American - major hub at MIA. Not quite as big as their ORD/DFW/CLT hubs, but close. Nonstops to almost every major and secondary city in the US plus a good amount of Europe and Latin America.\n2. Delta - average-sized operation at MIA. Nonstops to a handful of cities (ATL/DTW/LGA/JFK/MSP/LAX) with the ability to connect to almost anywhere through those hubs.\n\nThe majority of my travel will be the East Coast and Midwest. I currently live in NYC and have flown Delta for years. I’m a huge fan of their operation and service.\n\nSo here’s the main question to you current consultants: how much do you value the nonstop flight vs flying your preferred airline? Sure I could get lucky and be staffed in one of the 5-6 cities that Delta flies nonstop, but other than that it’d be one-stop-everything if I choose Delta. Does your firm care about you choosing connecting flights over nonstop? What about your team/managers at the client site?\n\nThanks, sorry for the barrage of questions lol.",

I've been copy and pasting this to various subreddits though regardless of my reasons, I hope to contribute in some meaningful way to this sub.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/klxt934e3pp31.jpg?width=1702&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec09d51267f5778bbec11c955c11066d0e7c9bcd\n\nMy name is David, I'm not Asian American myself, but I am the campaign manager for a short Asian American film now on Kickstarter entitled [A Father's Son](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chenxihao/a-fathers-son-a-90s-chinatown-noir-thriller). It's a Detective Noir Thriller that takes place in 1990s New York City Chinatown. The film is based off the character Jack Yu, from author Henry Chang's series of crime novels.\n\nThe project is currently in pre-production (though things are progressing rather quickly) and we're seeking $30,000 in funding to see this short film through production and to the festival circuit. Our goal is to have this short film act as a pilot for a larger network series.\n\nWe have some fantastic talent behind this production and are looking to spread the word and reach our goal. If you'd like to support the campaign, any amount helps. Any pledge will get you backer updates so you can watch how the project unfolds every step of the way.\n\nIf you have any questions at all about anything, consider this an unofficial AMA lol. I'm more than happy to share as much as I possibly can.",

    "text": "HELP WANTED - Art Project Hey everyone!\nWhile I was in graduate school I began an art project that I never completed. But according to some visiting artists and the faculty it had a lot promise.\nI took minimum wage worker uniforms and talked to a worker about their experiences as a Latinx hourly-wage worker. It started with mine: I had a stop and shop uniform I used to wear and recognized that I would always speak English with other Hispanics in front of white customers. I wrote that story on the uniform with a marker and hung it up. I also collected a shirt from a guy from Trader Joe’s and a CNA from a nursing home.\nOne of the things I was trying to accomplish with the art project was just collecting the experiences of minorities working hourly-wage jobs and combatting any assumption upper management or white Americans make about us: “s/he’s uneducated.” “they’re stealing jobs.” Etc...\nSo I was wondering if anyone in this subreddit has any shirts and stories they’d be interested in sharing?

    "text": "A response to a post on r/Feminism Earlier today, I made a crosspost in r/MensRights linking to a post from r/Feminism which had the following text:\n\n>Alot of the times when I see people talk about male rape or DV victims it's usually in the context of a woman talking about her experience with rape or DV, and it's usually like this: Commentor: \"Men FACE this kind of ABUSE everyday but SOCIETY only cares about WOMEN\"  \n>  \n>First of all that's not true. Despite the huge amounts of awareness, domestic violence against women is still a problem. Bisexual women are the group most likely to face domestic violence and women are more likely to experience abuse then men. Women are also more likely to be sexually abused, harassed, and even raped then men, so that is the primary reason female victims get more awareness, and also some time ago people would even encourage men to beat their female partners to 'keep them in line', it is not common to hear someone say that a woman should abuse her male partner to 'keep them in line', so that is the primary reason women victims get more awareness then men. Still, male victims do need help, shelter, and support, and also awareness. However, I think the biggest problem plaguing them is toxic masculinity. According to toxic masculinity, men are stronger and smarter then women so they can never be victims, but we know better. Men and women are equal, so in a hetero relationship a man can certainly be a victim. According to toxic masculinity, sex is one of the most valuable thing to a man that a woman can give him, so rape is impossible, but rape is possible, and atleast 1 in 75 men will be raped in their lifetime. Due to this, male victims are often shamed, especially by sexist men (Donald Trump and Sean Hannity once did this to a 14 year old who had been raped by his teacher) So in short, toxic masculinity harms male victims.  \n>  \n>But what saddens me is that many people, anti feminists and MRAs especially who dont give a shit about male victims will try to use them as a weapon against feminism, or just women in general. It's sickening, we can help victims of both genders, and non-binary victims as well, without 'competing' to see who is more oppressed.\n\nI provided a thorough rebuttal, with links to sources, in the comments of my crosspost in r/MensRights that linked to the r/Feminism post, but that post was removed by the moderators of this sub I assume because a mod thought I was encouraging brigading (I have since deleted it, since no one else will see it anyway). So I'll provide my responses here, and I'll neglect to provide the link to the original post in r/Feminism like my original post here did.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, let's tear down this feminist's ideas.\n\n>Alot of the times when I see people talk about male rape or DV victims it's usually in the context of a woman talking about her experience with rape or DV, and it's usually like this: Commentor: \"Men FACE this kind of ABUSE everyday but SOCIETY only cares about WOMEN\" First of all that's not true.  \n>  \n>Despite the huge amounts of awareness, domestic violence against women is still a problem. Bisexual women are the group most likely to face domestic violence and women are more likely to experience abuse then men.\n\nBefore you go any further with this, the research has shown gender symmetry in domestic violence. Approximately half of domestic violence is reciprocal violence where both partners abuse each other, and women are more likely to initiate this kind of violence. And in cases of non-reciprocal violence where the violence is unilaterally perpetrated by one partner against the other, female violence towards men is actually more common than male violence against women.\n\nHere is the LARGEST set of meta analyses on domestic violence by The Partner Abuse State of Knowledge Project (PASK). Researchers were asked to conduct a formal search for published, peer-reviewed studies through standard, widely-used search programs, and then catalogue and summarize all known research studies relevant to each major topic and its sub-topics. Approximately 12,000 studies were considered and more than 1,700 were summarized and organized into tables.\n\nThe key findings were:\n\n* Among large population samples, 57.9% of IPV reported was bi-directional, 42% unidirectional; 13.8% of the unidirectional violence was male to female (MFPV), 28.3% was female to male (FMPV)\n* Among school and college samples, percentage of bidirectional violence was 51.9%; 16.2% was MFPV and 31.9% was FMPV\n\nAnd before you say that even though women initiate violence more than men do in relationships, that women are still more often the victims of partner violence because their reasons for hitting are different than men's - I direct you to these quotes from my source:\n\n* Male and female IPV perpetrated from similar motives – primarily to get back at a partner for emotionally hurting them, because of stress or jealousy, to express anger and other feelings that they could not put into words or communicate, and to get their partner’s attention.\n* Eight studies directly compared men and women in the power/control motive and subjected their findings to statistical analyses. Three reported no significant gender differences and one had mixed findings. One paper found that women were more motivated to perpetrate violence as a result of power/control than were men, and three found that men were more motivated; however, gender differences were weak\n\n[https://domesticviolenceresearch.org](https://domesticviolenceresearch.org/)\n\nOh, and before you say some shit like \"Okay, female-on-male violence may be just as common if not more common than male-on-female violence, but women are still FAR more likely to be seriously injured by DV\" yeah no. The gender gap regarding harm and injury isn't nearly as big as you seem to think it is. IIRC statistically for every 8 women seriously injured by DV (injured seriously enough to require emergency medical attention), 5 men are. That's not nearly as big a gap as most people assume.\n\nThere are also some studies which show that men are actually *more* often injured by DV. A 2001 study called \"Physical aggression in a community sample of at-risk young couples: gender comparisons for high frequency, injury, and fear.\" indicated that 9.4% of men and 13.2% of women perpetrated frequent physical aggression toward their partners. Contrary to expectations, 13% of men and 9% of women, indicated that they were physically injured at least once. The authors reported \"2% of the men and none of the women indicate that they had been hurt by their partners between five and nine times.\"\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11584793](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11584793)\n\nA study called \"Partner Violence and Mental Health Outcomes in a New Zealand Birth Cohort\" revealed that men and women reported similar rates of injury (3.9% for women vs. 3.3% for men). In the words of the authors: \"The consequences of domestic violence in terms of injury and psychological effects were similar for both men and women.\"\n\n[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00202.x](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00202.x)\n\n[https://sci-hub.shop/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00202.x](https://sci-hub.shop/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00202.x)\n\nFurthermore, meta analyses have shown that the primary predictor of serious domestic violence injury in women is their own initiation of violence. Basically, you're more likely to be injured as a woman if the man is hitting you back. As said earlier, a huge amount (approximately half) of domestic violence is reciprocal, and it is more likely to be initiated by women. A large percentage of reciprocal violence involves the female partner assaulting and emotionally abusing the male partner until he snaps and reacts violently.\n\nMaybe if we want injury of women to come down, we should teach women not to initiate in the first place? Just a thought.\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223225227\\_Intimate\\_partner\\_physical\\_abuse\\_perpetration\\_and\\_victimization\\_risk\\_factors\\_A\\_meta-analytic\\_review](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223225227_Intimate_partner_physical_abuse_perpetration_and_victimization_risk_factors_A_meta-analytic_review)\n\n>Women are also more likely to be sexually abused, harassed, and even raped then men, so that is the primary reason female victims get more awareness\n\nAgain, go look at the data. Look at the CDC's NISVS. In the 2010 and 2011 reports just as many men reported having been subjected to nonconsensual sexual intercourse in the previous 12 months. In the 2012 report more men than women reported having been subjected to nonconsensual sexual intercourse in the previous 12 months.\n\nIt may not look immediately obvious, because they introduce their reports with findings such as these:\n\nNISVS 2010:\n\n\"Nearly 1 in 5 women (18.3%) and 1 in 71 men (1.4%) in the United States have been raped at some time in their lives, including completed forced penetration, attempted forced penetration, or alcohol/drug facilitated completed penetration.\"\n\nNISVS 2011:\n\n\"In the United States, an estimated 19.3% of women and 1.7% of men have been raped during their lifetimes; an estimated 1.6% of women reported that they were raped in the 12 months preceding the survey. The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.\"\n\nHowever, the rape numbers in these studies do not cover all victims of nonconsensual sex, they only cover victims who were forcibly penetrated by a perpetrator. If a man was forced to penetrate a perpetrator, this would not be considered as rape and it would instead fall into a separate category \"made to penetrate\".\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs\\_report2010-a.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf)\n\n*Rape is defined as any completed or attempted unwanted vaginal (for women), oral, or anal penetration through the use of physical force (such as being pinned or held down, or by the use of violence) or threats to physically harm and includes times when the victim was drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent.*\n\n*Rape is separated into three types, completed forced penetration, attempted forced penetration, and completed alcohol or drug facilitated penetration.*\n\n*Among women, rape includes vaginal, oral, or anal penetration by a male using his penis.It also includes vaginal or anal penetration by a male or female using their fingers or an object.*  \n\n*Among men, rape includes oral or anal penetration by a male using his penis. It also includes anal penetration by a male or female using their fingers or an object.*\n\n*Being made to penetrate someone else includes times when the victim was made to,or there was an attempt to make them, sexually penetrate someone without the victim’s consent because the victim was physically forced (such as being pinned or held down, or by the use of violence) or threatened with physical harm, or when the victim was drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent.*  \n\n*Among women, this behavior reflects a female being made to orally penetrate another female’s vagina or anus.*\n\n*Among men, being made to penetrate someone else could have occurred in multiple ways: being made to vaginally penetrate a female using one’s own penis; orally penetrating a female’s vagina or anus; anally penetrating a male or female; or being made to receive oral sex from a male or female. It also includes female perpetrators attempting to force male victims to penetrate them, though it did not happen.*\n\nESSENTIALLY: under the NISVS' methodologies a woman drugging and riding a man would not be counted as rape. The numbers for men who have been raped only refer to men who were penetrated, for example men who have been forced into anal sex or made to perform oral sex on another man. And yes, situations like these are comparatively rare.\n\nMen being forced to penetrate a perpetrator, on the other hand, is much more common, but it is not included as rape and instead gets considered as \"made to penetrate\". Made to penetrate falls into the category \"other sexual violence\" with other vastly less severe forms of sexual violence and harassment such as \"non-contact unwanted sexual experiences\".\n\nHowever, since the CDC gathered the data for \"made to penetrate\", that allows us to make comparisons. One-year prevalence is considered to be more accurate than lifetime rates because they do not depend on recall of events long past, and therefore we will be using these numbers to analyse the 2010, 2011, and 2012 NISVS studies. In each of these years, when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being “made to penetrate” -either by physical force or due to intoxication - at virtually the same rates as women reported rape.\n\nNISVS 2010 showed that in the past 12 months, 1.1% of men (or an estimated 1,267,000 men) were made to penetrate and 1.1% of women (or an estimated 1,270,000 women) were raped.\n\nNISVS 2011 showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men (or an estimated 1,921,000 men) were made to penetrate and 1.6% of women (or an estimated 1,929,000 women) were raped.\n\nNISVS 2012 showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men (or an estimated 1,957,000 men) were made to penetrate and 1.0% of women (or an estimated 1,217,000 women) were raped.\n\nIn each of the years the case count for male rape victims and female victims of made-to-penetrate were too small to provide a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.\n\nHere is a table [(source)](https://recalculatingthegenderwar.tumblr.com/post/162336650896/new-cdc-data-again-finds-as-many-if-not-more) to easily demonstrate it.\n\nCDC NISVS Yearly Rape and Made-To-Penetrate Victimisation\n\n||Rape (women)|Rape (men)|Made to penetrate (women)|Made to penetrate (men)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2010|1.1% (est 1,270,000)|\\*|\\*|1.1% (est 1,267,000)|\n|2011|1.6% (est 1,929,000)|\\*|\\*|1.7% (est 1,921,000)|\n|2012|1.0% (est 1,217,000)|\\*|\\*|1.7% (est 1,957,000)|\n\n^(\\*Zero or statistically insignificant amount according to NISVS)\n\nYou can see that the estimated numbers of male victims of made to penetrate each year look very similar to the estimated numbers of female victims of rape. So if made to penetrate happens about as often as rape each year then by most people's assumed definition of rape (nonconsensual sex) then men are approximately half of rape victims each year.\n\nIn 2010:\n\n1,267,000/2,537,000 = 49.9% of victims of nonconsensual sex in 2010 were men.\n\nIn 2011:\n\n1,921,000/3,850,000 = 49.9% of victims of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were men.\n\nIn 2012:\n\n1,957,000/3,174,000 = 61.7% of victims of nonconsensual sex in 2012 were men.\n\nSo if you're a normal human being who defines rape as simply non-consensual sex instead of solely \"forced penetration of the victim\" like the CDC does then men are half of rape victims. Hmmm.\n\n>and also some time ago people would even encourage men to beat their female partners to 'keep them in line', it is not common to hear someone say that a woman should abuse her male partner to 'keep them in line', so that is the primary reason women victims get more awareness then men.\n\nYou really have a skewed view of the past. Yes, in the past men were allowed to use \"mild correction\" on their wives under the law (as he was socially and legally responsible for the actions of his wife to the extent that he could even be held accountable for the crimes and offences she committed), but he could not beat her black and blue. Men had restrictions on what corporal punishment they could use on their wives.\n\nIn Colonial America, when men went beyond what was legally acceptable, they received punishment through the pillory. “The pillory was employed for treason, sedition, arson, blasphemy, witchcraft, perjury, wife beating, cheating, forgery, coin clipping, dice cogging, slandering, conjuring, fortune-telling, and drunkenness, among other offences. On several occasions, onlookers pelted the pilloried prisoner so enthusiastically with heavy missiles that death resulted.”\n\n[https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring03/branks.cfm](https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring03/branks.cfm)\n\nThe whipping post also was a favourite form of punishment for wife-beating. Many examples of vigilante justice, sometimes lethal, enacted against wifebeaters can be found in newspaper clippings from the 1800s and onward, with the full endorsement of society.\n\n[https://unapologeticallyantifeminist.video.blog/2019/05/21/correcting-notions-about-domestic-violence-in-history/](https://unapologeticallyantifeminist.video.blog/2019/05/21/correcting-notions-about-domestic-violence-in-history/)\n\nWe can assume that this was practiced in Europe as well. Likewise, Americans practiced shivaree and Europeans practiced charivari as a way to enable social censure of wife-beaters. Charivari was a historical folk custom expressing public disapproval of personal behaviour, where a mock parade was staged through a community accompanied by a discordant mock serenade. Sometimes the crowd would carry an effigy of the targeted man to a substitute punishment, e.g. burning. Sometimes the man who physically abused his wife would be abused by the community.\n\nThey would chant:\n\n*Old Abram Higback has been paying his good woman; But he neither paid her for what or for why, But he up with his fist and blacked her eye.*\n\n*Now all ye old women, and old women kind, Get together, and be in a mind; Collar him, and take him to the shit-house, And shove him over head.*\n\n*Now if that does not mend his manners, The skin of his arse must go to the tanners; And if that does not mend his manners, Take him and hang him on a nail in Hell.*\n\n*And if the nail happens to crack, Down with your flaps, and at him piss.*\n\nHowever, if a husband was beaten by his wife - the husband, in contrast, was also the subject of the charivari for essentially allowing it to happen. In France about 1400, husbands beaten by their wives were “paraded on an ass, face to tail.”  In England, a [mural in Montacute House](https://montacutehouse.blogspot.com/2012/04/skimmington-ride.html) (constructed about 1598) shows a wife beating her husband with a shoe and then a crowd parading the husband on a [cowlstaff](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cowlstaff). \n\nSamuel Pepys recorded in his diary, 10 June 1667: “in the afternoon took boat and down to Greenwich, where I find the stairs full of people, there being a great riding there to-day for a man, the constable of the town, whose wife beat him.”\n\nA Frenchman who traveled in England reported in 1698: \"I have sometimes met in the streets of London a woman carrying a figure of straw representing a man, crown’d with very ample horns, preceded by a drum, and followed by a mob, making a most grating noise with tongs, grid-irons, frying-pans, and sauce-pans. I asked what was the meaning of all this; they told me that a woman had given her husband a sound beating, for accusing her of making him a cuckold, and that upon such occasions some kind neighbour of the poor innocent injur’d creature generally performed this ceremony.\"\n\n[https://www.purplemotes.net/2013/01/27/charivari-sex-inequality/](https://www.purplemotes.net/2013/01/27/charivari-sex-inequality/)\n\nHmmm. So while a man could give his wife mild correction under the law, if he went too far with wife-beating the community would frown down upon him and punish him with the pillory, whippings and charivari. THERE WAS NO SUCH EXTREME SOCIAL OR LEGAL CENSURE FOR A WIFE WHO BEAT HER HUSBAND. IF SHE BEAT HIM, HE WAS THE ONE WHO WAS PUNISHED.\n\nThat doesn't sound at all like what you were saying, that wife-beating was considered \"100% okay and encouraged by the community\" whereas husband-beating was condemned.\n\n>Still, male victims do need help, shelter, and support, and also awareness. However, I think the biggest problem plaguing them is toxic masculinity. According to toxic masculinity, men are stronger and smarter then women so they can never be victims, but we know better. Men and women are equal, so in a hetero relationship a man can certainly be a victim.\n\n\"But we know better\" my ass. Feminists have been happy to capitalise on gendered viewpoints of men as strong and oppressive when it suits them, and women as weak, victimised, incapable of causing harm and in need of help and protection. In fact, all they've done is reinforce that viewpoint. Wouldn't you know it, it is not toxic men, but feminists, who have been very happy to paint domestic violence as an issue in which men are the sole perpetrators and women are the sole victims.\n\n**Feminist theories of domestic violence and the Duluth Model**\n\nFeminist theory characterises DV as a sexually directional problem (men abusing women) which is rooted in patriarchal norms of masculine dominance and female subordination. Basically, they theorise that the reason for this gender disparity is that men are socialised in a patriarchal society that makes them feel entitled to have power, dominance and control over women. The earliest batter intervention programs that emerged were based on this feminist theory, that a man needs to control a woman.\n\nLater on, in 1981, when the Duluth Model, a more structured approach to batterer treatment, was created, it was (surprise) also based on this very same feminist idea that domestic violence is a sexually directional problem caused by \"patriarchal terrorism\". In essence, the program attempts to halt men's violent behavior by focusing on the supposed reason they batter: to maintain individual and societal patriarchal dominance. The Duluth Model does not, however, address other possible reasons for violence, including substance abuse problems, psychological problems, violent backgrounds, or unhealthy relationship dynamics. Other common risk factors for violence, such as \"stress on the perpetrator, impulse control problems, trait anger, communication skill deficits, couples' negative interaction, or personality disturbance,\" are systematically excluded as excuses.\n\nAnd under this faulty model, women cannot, as a conceptual matter, perpetrate partner abuse. If they hit their male partners, it was in self defence. If they hit first, or are the only partner who hits, they are doing it within the context of \"violent resistance\" against presumed emotional or psychological abuse on his part. Any violence perpetrated by a woman is dismissed as either non-existent, self-defensive, or insignificant.\n\nThis model is now so widely accepted that it is the most commonly state-mandated model of intervention and is the sole model in the majority of US states and across the English speaking west, despite the statistical evidence contradicting this feminist narrative in a big way. It is the paradigm used to train police, social workers, counsellors, lawyers, judges, medical personnel, guardians ad litem and anyone else who may become involved in a domestic violence case.\n\n[https://honest-ribbon.org/mega-featured/duluth-model-buries-key-facts-on-domestic-violence/](https://honest-ribbon.org/mega-featured/duluth-model-buries-key-facts-on-domestic-violence/)\n\nPart of the reason why this idea has managed to get so much traction is because researchers, activists and reformers who support the idea of gender symmetry and contradict the feminist viewpoint of domestic violence as a sexually directional problem have been ostracised, shamed and silenced for going against the prevailing narrative.\n\nIn 1971, Erin Pizzey opened the world's first DV shelter. She soon realized that most of the women there were as violent as, or more violent than, the men they were fleeing. So she began talking about it, and feminists protested against her. She began to receive regular bomb and death threats. She eventually had to flee England with her children due to all the protests, threats, and violence, and she has said she is banned from the refuge she started.\n\nIn 1977, Suzanne Steinmetz published a book and articles which clearly showed about equal rates of perpetration by males and females. Anger over this resulted in a bomb threat at her daughters’ wedding and she was the object of a letter writing campaign to deny her promotion and tenure at the University of Delaware.\n\nIn 1979, Murray Straus, a family violence researcher was challenged by some colleagues to conduct unbiased research on DV. What he found was gender symmetry in perpetration and victimization. He published his findings, and was subjected to a campaign of threats, blacklisting, shunning, having his grad students' careers sabotaged, etc etc.\n\nThese types of harassment have caused there to be widespread self-censorship by people who fear that contradicting the feminist narrative will negatively affect their prospects.\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228350210\\_Gender\\_symmetry\\_in\\_partner\\_violence\\_The\\_evidence\\_the\\_denial\\_and\\_the\\_implications\\_for\\_primary\\_prevention\\_and\\_treatment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228350210_Gender_symmetry_in_partner_violence_The_evidence_the_denial_and_the_implications_for_primary_prevention_and_treatment)\n\n**Violence Against Women Act**\n\nSo. Radical feminists have fought against acknowledgement of male victims and female perpetrators. They have pushed a faulty model which characterises domestic violence as a primarily or even uniquely male-on-female crime and have described it as patriarchal violence. Even worse, they have attacked and attempted to silence people who have dared to demonstrate gender symmetry in DV - even engaging in acts of terrorism to do so.\n\nAnd they have used this faulty conceptualisation of DV to justify gender-discriminatory legislation. The National Organisation for Women lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male. It was only through a procedural technicality regarding funding and different levels of government taxation that the old law was halted midway through reauthorization, and a new, gender neutral one was introduced. Women's groups, such as the National Organization for Women, fought hard to keep the language in the Act gendered, despite entreaties from LGBTQ groups to reconsider how the language of female victims and male perpetrators failed to serve their community.\n\nAnd even with the gender-neutral version of VAWA that exists now, the Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women (the principal federal agency that administers VAWA funds) has issued many directives and established funding mechanisms that are openly discriminatory in nature.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/695m34/karen\\_straughans\\_response\\_to\\_those\\_arent\\_real/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&utm\\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/695m34/karen_straughans_response_to_those_arent_real/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n[http://www.saveservices.org/pdf/SAVE-VAWA-Discriminates-Against-Males.pdf](http://www.saveservices.org/pdf/SAVE-VAWA-Discriminates-Against-Males.pdf)\n\n**Predominant Aggressor Policies**\n\nIn the 1980s, there was a call for a vigorous law enforcement response to address the issue of DV, with mandatory arrest laws being instituted in several states. When, however, it was apparent that these same laws led to a large number of dual arrests, and a proportionately greater increase in arrests of women compared to men, feminists started calling for primary aggressor or dominant aggressor laws that told police that instead of arresting both parties, they should just arrest the \"primary aggressor in the relationship\". In determining who the primary aggressor was, they prioritised relative height, weight, strength, AND patriarchal/feminist models of domestic violence (Duluth again), over inconvenient matters such as \"who is the abusive party?\"\n\nThey essentially adjusted policy to make outcomes conform to their theory, rather than adjusting their theory to conform to reality. And the gender ratio in arrests returned to normal - 85% male, at least 1/3 of which would've been victims. How nice.\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233694571\\_In\\_Dubious\\_Battle\\_The\\_Politics\\_of\\_Mandatory\\_Arrest\\_and\\_Dominant\\_Aggressor\\_Laws](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233694571_In_Dubious_Battle_The_Politics_of_Mandatory_Arrest_and_Dominant_Aggressor_Laws)\n\n**The resulting injustice against male victims of abuse**\n\nThese feminist reforms have created a lot of social injustice for male victims of domestic violence. There are many qualitative studies of male helpseekers who reveal that they are turned away, doubted, ridiculed by the formal systems in place that are supposed to prevent DV. Across multiple studies a huge amount of male victims reported being referred to batterers' programs when they called domestic violence hotlines, or arrested by the police who made the false presumption that the man was the primary aggressor. Within the judicial system, some men who sustained DV reported experiencing gender-stereotyped treatment. Even with apparent corroborating evidence that their female partners were violent and that the helpseekers were not, they reportedly lost custody of their children, were blocked from seeing their children, and were falsely accused by their partners of DV and abusing their children.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175099/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175099/)\n\nSo it's feminists that have repeatedly, consistently minimised female-on-male abuse, said that it's SUPER rare and doesn't happen nearly enough for people to care about it (and if it does happen, he was asking for it), shamed and silenced researchers who dared to demonstrate gender symmetry in domestic violence, and used their fucked up worldview to push for law and policy that discriminates against male victims.\n\n>But what saddens me is that many people, anti feminists and MRAs especially who dont give a shit about male victims will try to use them as a weapon against feminism, or just women in general. It's sickening, we can help victims of both genders, and non-binary victims as well, without 'competing' to see who is more oppressed.\n\nYou just, uh, did that in your post. You just competed to see who was more oppressed. You justified the greater awareness and concern for female victims and relative lack of it for male victims by saying \"Women are more likely to be victims of rape and domestic violence than men\" when the statistical evidence actually says otherwise.\n\nAnti-feminists and MRAs that say \"Uh actually, men are very likely to be abused or raped as well\" aren't competing to see who is more oppressed, and they aren't playing Oppression Olympics. We're objecting to YOU feminists playing Oppression Olympics and spreading lies about how women have it so much worse and have always had it so much worse than men to justify unequal treatment when they really don't. Even if you want to help men, you and feminists like you are still lying to us about the nature of the problem, about the nature of society--both pre and post-feminism--and about the nature of men.\n\nAnd as girlwriteswhat says in [this](http://owningyourshit.blogspot.com/2011/09/time-to-set-down-tools.html) blog post: \"while many would insist that any help--even wrongheaded help--is better than none, that if a feminist believes men are \"the minority\" of victims of severe DV still deserve support then we should bring that feminist on board...it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth.\"\n\n\"Because that is not alliance--it's *conditional assistance*, and it is conditional upon them being allowed to go on believing the same lies as before, and spreading them, and feeding the problem even as they're supposedly trying to solve it. And someone who cannot or will not see truth, who is lying even when he believes he's telling the truth, isn't someone you can trust as far as you can throw him.\"\n\nThanks for playing, though.\n\nedit: wording",

    "text": "People constantly overstate the extent to which women were \"oppressed\" in the past. People constantly quote that \"women didn't have the right to own property\", \"women were chattel\", \"women were allowed to be abused, beaten and raped by men\", \"women didn't have the right to vote\", \"women were kept out of male-dominated industries\", \"women were oppressed by men\", etc.\n\nAll this is bullshit.\n\nUnder coverture, single women otherwise known as \"femme sole\" did have the right to own property, had the right to enter into contracts, and overall had the same rights as single men. It was only when they married that they sacrificed some of their rights to own property and enter into contracts on their own.\n\nWhen a woman got married she was considered a \"femme covert\" and her existence was consolidated into that of the man's. People constantly take this to mean that she was chattel, owned by men but this was not the case. Once they were married, women were entitled to be supported and to have the portion that she brought into the marriage managed by their husbands, to the best of their ability. Women had the right to buy necessaries on their husband's credit as their husband's agent. Women could not be prosecuted for most crimes and their husbands would be prosecuted in their stead. Women were immune from liability for debt. They were not in any way chattel, they definitely had less agency, but at the same time they were entitled to protections and privileges and it was considered the man's duty to provide said protections and privileges for them. Women have very frequently sought redress in common law and equity courts when husbands failed in their duties.\n\nMarried women were also not allowed to be abused unlike what people think. The laws allowed for mild correction such as spanking the way you would a child at the time but husbands were not allowed to beat their wives black and blue. A woman could obtain a surety of the peace bond to ensure her safety from a violent husband.\n\n[https://lonang.com/library/reference/blackstone-commentaries-law-england/bla-115/](https://lonang.com/library/reference/blackstone-commentaries-law-england/bla-115/)\n\n[https://www.legalgenealogist.com/2019/02/12/the-defense-of-coverture/](https://www.legalgenealogist.com/2019/02/12/the-defense-of-coverture/)\n\n[https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download\\_file?file\\_format=application/pdf&safe\\_filename=Item.pdf&type\\_of\\_work=Journal%20article](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download_file?file_format=application/pdf&safe_filename=Item.pdf&type_of_work=Journal%20article)\n\nYes, women didn't have the right to vote for most of history, but neither did men. Property owners had the vote, the vast majority of men did not. Male suffrage was something that was fought for, and when men did end up getting the vote before women it wasn't necessarily because of discrimination against women. It was because the vote at the time was seen as a direct extension of men's obligation to be conscripted and fight in war, something which women were not obligated to do.\n\nSomething that makes this even more muddy than it already is is that: the reason why votes for women took so long to be implemented was that the majority of women did not want the vote. There were many anti-suffragette societies, and a fair amount of them were led by women.\n\n[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1910/jul/11/parliamentary-franchise-women-bill](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1910/jul/11/parliamentary-franchise-women-bill)\n\n[https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-history-dept/2015/10/22/450221328/american-women-who-were-anti-suffragettes](https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-history-dept/2015/10/22/450221328/american-women-who-were-anti-suffragettes)\n\n[http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/gilded/power/text12/antisuffrageassoc.pdf](http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/gilded/power/text12/antisuffrageassoc.pdf)\n\nWomen were allowed to work in a lot of male-dominated industries. Guild-type work was always open to single women and windows. In fact there is a lack of evidence of anything preventing women from working. An article (which I've linked below) says:\n\n\"For most girls, becoming a blacksmith was probably not a dream. Husband, family, home: those were the pursuits of a young woman of the eighteenth century. Finding a woman or women working at all outside the home, much less in a male-dominated trade, most likely meant the dream wasn't shaping up the way they'd hoped. Some women worked because they had no choice.\"\n\n\"Though there was no system of standards governing the trades in the colonies, the method of learning a trade generally followed the apprenticeship guidelines established by the guilds in medieval England and Europe. Women were not excluded from membership in any of the earlier guilds. The Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths in London lists sixty-five \"brethren\" and two \"sistren\" in its 1434 charter.\"\n\nThe paragraph below is a quote from a redditor \"w1g2\" who made a really good point regarding work, and women's involvement in it.\n\nWas it a social norm that most women did not seek out careers as they do now? Sure, I don't doubt it. But women did not have access to reliable birth control (because it hadn't been invented) so unless they wanted to spend the entirety of their life chaste, would have to plan for many of their years being filled with pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, etc. Not to mention, quite a lot of the jobs available weren't in nice air- conditioned offices but involved hard labor or danger like becoming a doctor (working with the near dead, sometimes even people with a plague) or a lawyer (working with criminals, especially when prisons did not have as nice standards for living). Maybe it's the case that in different environments, people, including women, will have to react accordingly to different things and maybe it's understandable that in an environment that used to have far more risk and danger and death and with little knowledge or control over fertility, women wanted different things than they do now.\n\n[https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring04/women.cfm](https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring04/women.cfm)\n\nSo. Women were not nearly as \"oppressed\" as people seem to think they were. There was never a patriarchy holding women down. Were there burdens, obligations and disadvantages? At times, yes. But these usually did not run one way - men too had their own set of burdens. And whenever I mention this to people it's met with handwaving or sometimes outright denial of the evidence.\n\nIt seems to be very hard for a lot of people I've seen to believe that women had a lot more privilege and social power than previously believed, and that men had obligations imposed on them.",

    "text": "A compilation of evidence debunking feminist historical revisionism. I have made a post somewhat similar to this before but I've since collected a lot more information about these topics and so I believe warrants yet another post.\n\n*Myth #1: Women weren't allowed to work.*\n\nMost documentation from the past heavily implies that people attempted to avoid working as much as possible. Even so, many women did work (mostly because they had no choice but to) and there has never been a law restricting women from working.\n\n\"Though creative research has produced evidence of women working at male-dominated occupations in the eighteenth century and before, there is undoubtedly more documentation out there, in newspapers, diaries, legal proceedings, and prints. What is more compelling is the lack of documentation that women were not allowed to work. Although religious practices and social norms might have restricted certain activities in some parts of the world, there were no laws prohibiting women from working a trade.\"\n\nAt the time, only members of a trade guild (associations of producers that trained craft people, maintained control over production, regulated competition and prices) were allowed to sell their goods or practice their skill within the city. Non-guild members were prohibited from selling competitive products. An aspiring master would have to pass through the career chain from apprentice to journeyman before they could be elected to become a master tradesman. They would then have to produce a sum of money and a masterpiece before they could actually join the guild. If the masterpiece was not accepted by the masters, they were not allowed to join the guild, possibly remaining a journeyman for the rest of their life.\n\nWomen were not barred from any of the trade guilds in Britain at least as far back as the 1400s. Apprentice forms for guildwork had spaces left blank to insert 'he' or 'she', though girls who chose this traditional route to mastery of a trade (which was extremely long and arduous) were usually orphaned and had low prospects for marriage, thus they were going to need to work.\n\nMarried women, though, had the privilege of circumventing the long, onerous, arduous process of trade certification as they could receive the master tradesman status from their husbands and thereby continue his work, even take on apprentices to train (which suggests that the social assumption was that wives would learn enough about their husband's business and trade to be able to at least continue to oversee it after he died). Lots of widows continued to run their husbands' businesses long after their death.\n\nThe Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths in London lists sixty-five \"brethren\" and two \"sistren\" in its 1434 charter.\n\nA 1770 publication called *The Tradesman's True Guide or a Universal Directory for the Towns of Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Walsal, Dudley and the manufacturing village in the neighborhood of Birmingham* carried exhaustive lists of tradesmen and tradeswomen alphabetically by name and by trade, and there are women listed in every trade from butcher to wire drawer.\n\n[https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring04/women.cfm](https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring04/women.cfm)\n\nReally, very little I've seen shows that women were maliciously \"kept out\" from trades or professions that they wanted to enter into. It may have been a social norm that most women did not seek out careers as they do now, but looking at the histories of the first women to enter into medicine, law, etc, show that they hardly faced any resistance in doing so.\n\nIn 1847, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman to attend medical school in the US and was the first woman on the Medical Register of the General Medical Council. She sent applications for admission to twelve of the most promising institutions in the northern states, and her application was accepted by the medical department of Geneva University. Feminist revisionist history \"explains\" that she was only admitted to the college by the evil men as a joke, but as will be amply demonstrated this is the opposite of what actually happened.\n\nIn fact, the student body sent her a letter to welcome her:\n\n>At a meeting of the entire medical class of Geneva Medical College, held this day, October 20, 1847, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:–  \n>  \n>Resolved – That one of the radical principles of a Republican Government is the universal education of both sexes; that to every branch of scientific education the door should be open equally to all; that the application of Elizabeth Blackwell to become a member of our class meets our entire approbation; and in extending our unanimous invitation we pledge ourselves that no conduct of ours shall cause her to regret her attendance at this institution.  \n>  \n>2. Resolved – That a copy of these proceedings be signed by the chairman and transmitted to Elizabeth Blackwell.\n\nShe describes this letter as one of her most valued possessions, and in her autobiography she states that the men of the college supported her 100% and beyond.\n\n\"The behaviour of the medical class during the two years that I was with them was admirable. It was that of true Christian gentlemen. I learned later that some of them had been inclined to think my application for admission a hoax, perpetrated at their expense by a rival college. But when the *bona-fide* student actually appeared they gave her a manly welcome, and fulfilled to the letter the promise contained in their invitation.\"\n\nShe also notes that the general public also had a favourable view of a woman entering into medicine.\n\n\"The admission of a woman for the first time to a complete medical education and full equality in the privileges and the responsibilities of the profession produced a widespread effect in America. The public press very generally recorded the event, and expressed a favourable opinion of it. Even in Europe some notice of it was taken, and 'Punch' showed his cordial appreciation by his amusing but friendly verses.\"\n\n[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/blackwell/pioneer/pioneer.html?fbclid=IwAR09FZZlnVMVha0PNLYnQQDSnptVDEoGxokEf10QHPCGgxZMly5HyfDlgQI#III](http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/blackwell/pioneer/pioneer.html?fbclid=IwAR09FZZlnVMVha0PNLYnQQDSnptVDEoGxokEf10QHPCGgxZMly5HyfDlgQI#III)\n\nThere are also other examples of women entering into \"male\" fields and encountering little resistance. There's the example of Arabella Mansfield, the first female lawyer in the United States. Although by Iowa law the bar exam was restricted to \"males over 21,\" Arabella Mansfield took the exam in 1869, passing it with high scores. Mansfield challenged the state law excluding her, and the Court ruled that women may not be denied the right to practice law in Iowa, admitting Mansfield to the bar.\n\nOr Ada Lovelace, who was encouraged in her mathematical ability from a young age by her parents and received the best of tutors to increase her ability. She worked with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Machine, though they both \"fell into historical obscurity, and the Analytical Engine was unknown to builders of electro-mechanical and electronic computing machines in the 1930s and 1940s when they began their work, resulting in the need to re-invent many of the architectural innovations Babbage had proposed.\"\n\nOr Amelia Earhart, who was flown \"like a sack of potatoes\" by pilot Wilmer Stultz across the Atlantic in her 1928 transatlantic flight, and immediately became a celebrity, wrote a book about the experience, was used to endorse products, and dubbed 'Lady Lindy'. There is a plaque that marks where the plane landed in Wales. All the fervour over it was solely because she was a woman who crossed the Atlantic regardless of the fact that she didn't do any flying at all in her 1928 flight (She did, however, go on to complete a transatlantic solo flight later on in 1932).\n\n[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia\\_Earhart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Earhart)\n\nOr, for a very long-ago example of this, Murasaki Shikibu from Japan around the year 1000, who listened at the door while her brother received lessons in Chinese writing and through that learned it herself. She was far from reviled for being a woman who knew Chinese and was commissioned by the Empress to write the Tale of Genji, a classic work of Japanese literature often called the world's first novel.\n\nOh, the o p p r e s s i o n .\n\n*Myth #2: Marriage was an institution created by men to oppress women. Men were disproportionately given privilege and power and women were treated like his property in marriage.*\n\nAgain this is a bastardisation of the past. Feminism has to stop treating men as the enemy and as the source of all women's (and also men's) problems. They need to realise that things weren't always as they are now, and realise that it was not Patriarchy or men that restricted the choices of both genders and forced them into strictly defined roles, but that these roles came about because it was the best way of arranging societies in the past - a past that was much harsher and more unforgiving than it is now. A past in which there was more work to do than there were hours in a day. A past where men spent most of their short lives working like mules to support themselves and their families and women spent most of their short lives incapacitated by childbirth and child-rearing. A past in which we sent children into coal mines that ruined their lungs and into factories which lost them limbs. Things sucked, and the reason it was bearable at all back then was *because* of the gender roles.\n\nMen were not the ones who relegated women to the domestic sphere or kept them dependent on men. Biology did. A woman at that time could not simply strike out on her own and do whatever she wanted. For most of history we had no reliable birth control, no safe abortion, no maternity leave, or social security, and most public sphere work back then involved hard labour. And if you were a woman back then who wanted to be able to have sex, then you would have had to plan your life around the idea that you would be getting pregnant, giving birth, and breastfeeding for most of your adult life - and that would have meant you could not be a reliable enough worker to support even yourself, let alone a child, and it would inherently have made you dependent on other people to help you. Until the last 100 years or so, most women could not have lived a life of children and public sphere work, independent of a man (and not all can today, realistically).\n\nEven with support, most women in poor and middle class families had to work because that was the only way to make enough money to live.\n\nSo in a time when single motherhood was a one-way trip to the gutter, marriage was a practical arrangement. The function of marriage was not to oppress women, but to positively assign paternity inasmuch as possible, and then obligate the men so assigned to their children and the mothers of their children. For life.\n\nThe taboo on sex outside of marriage (which was applied to men no less than women) made it difficult for an unscrupulous man to cheat the system. These rules surrounding marriage also mitigated the problem of paternity uncertainty, which maximised men's willingness to invest in their kids. \"I know these are my kids, so I will work hard to feed and shelter them.\" And the reason why we kept lifelong monogamous marriage for so long is because it increased the resources which would have been available to offspring, providing a healthier environment for children to grow up in.\n\nSo when a man married a woman, he was legally obligated to feed, clothe and shelter her and any children produced in the marriage to the best of his ability. Unlike what feminists seem to think, he could not sell her. He could not return her for his money back. He could not drop her at the local midden heap. He could not destroy her the way he could his actual chattels. He could not trade her for a better one. He could not legally neglect her.\n\nJust to make things crystal clear, here is a summary list of entitlements that women enjoyed in marriage (and after marriage) during the old \"patriarchal\" system of the past.\n\n1. When a woman married, she had to hand over her property to her husband's care (again, NOT because she herself was property, but because he was administrator of the family), but he OWED her not just a living, but the best living he was financially capable of providing for her. A wife was entitled to be maintained by her husband.\n2. Though women did not have the right to enter into contracts in their own name in marriage, women had the privilege of the Law of Agency, giving them the legal right to purchase goods on their husbands' credit as their agent. If the wife racked up debts that the husband couldn't pay, she was immune from liability for the debts she racked up - that liability fell to the husband instead.\n3. Women had the entitlement of being protected from prosecution for any number of crimes if they could prove their husbands were aware of said crimes. In which case, he would be prosecuted in her stead--not just held AS responsible as she was, but held solely responsible for her actions. This allowed married women to displace accountability for a large number of offences onto their husbands. \"She's out of control and does what she wants, regardless of my wishes,\" was not a valid legal defence for those men.\n4. Women were exempt from paying taxes, and there was an entire female underground economy of barter and trade that was not subject to taxation or government interference. Even when married women gained the right to hold property within marriage, it was their husbands who were responsible for the taxes owing on it, and it was their husbands who were held 100% financially liable for providing all necessaries to the family, including the wife, even if she made more money than he did.\n5. After divorce, men were held fully financially responsible under the law for the ex-wife and kids. Divorced women were entitled to be supported by their ex-husbands to a level commensurate with the husband's for potentially the rest of their lives unless she remarried.\n\n[https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download\\_file?file\\_format=application/pdf&safe\\_filename=Item.pdf&type\\_of\\_work=Journal%20article](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download_file?file_format=application/pdf&safe_filename=Item.pdf&type_of_work=Journal%20article)\n\nThat doesn't sound at all like women were treated like property to me.\n\nI'm sorry, but if I have property, I have no legal duty of care toward the actual property I own, nor any obligation to commit to own it until death. I can smash my property on the ground and treat it however I want and it would be my right to do so. Men could not do any of that to the women they were married to. They had obligations towards them to provide for them - even after divorce, and to protect them - even from the consequences of their own actions. Wives had no such obligation towards their husbands - they were entitled to be the ones who were supported. Because the purpose of marriage in the past was not to oppress women and make them the property of men, but to ensure that women and their children could be provided for and protected, and to place the responsibility for that provision and protection on the man even at cost to his own wellbeing, health, and even life. This has been the case since time immemorial.\n\n\"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.\"\n\nEphesians 5.\n\n[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A22-33&version=NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A22-33&version=NIV)\n\nIn fact, many of the supposed \"privileges\" men had in marriage in the past were to help them carry out their obligations and to prevent them from becoming wholly onerous.\n\nIf a man had an obligation to be accountable for provision for his wife and children and to maintain family finances, it stood to reason that he also should have the entitlement of having control over any assets of his marriage, including those his wife brought into the marriage, because he was the one who had a responsibility to keep the entire family afloat and to increase their holdings.\n\nIf a man was responsible for the protection of his wife and children to the point where he could be legally required to stand between his wife and the law within numerous contexts, and be punished in her stead (whether she contracted debts he couldn't pay or committed a crime he would have to answer for), it makes sense why he would be considered head of household and why his family would need to obey him as well as abide by the restrictions he placed on them.\n\nIf, upon divorce, a man would be held solely responsible for the maintenance of his wife and child, it makes sense why he would get custody of the child that he was supporting, as well as ownership of assets so he could satisfy that obligation.\n\nWe gave men these rights and privileges because they were the tools that he needed to satisfy his responsibilities. And in that way there was a balance. \"Women \"got less\" because their obligations and accountability were less, their responsibility was less. Men \"got more\" because the buck stopped with them, whether that buck consisted of a sack of coins or his blood.\"\n\n*Myth #3: Men were allowed to beat their wives with impunity.*\n\nIn the past men were allowed to use \"mild correction\" on their wives under the law (as he was socially and legally responsible for the actions of his wife to the extent that he could even be held accountable for the crimes and offences she committed), but he could not beat her black and blue. Men had restrictions on what corporal punishment they could use on their wives.\n\nIn Colonial America, when men went beyond what was legally acceptable, they received punishment through the pillory. “The pillory was employed for treason, sedition, arson, blasphemy, witchcraft, perjury, wife beating, cheating, forgery, coin clipping, dice cogging, slandering, conjuring, fortune-telling, and drunkenness, among other offences. On several occasions, onlookers pelted the pilloried prisoner so enthusiastically with heavy missiles that death resulted.”\n\n[https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring03/branks.cfm](https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring03/branks.cfm)\n\nThe whipping post also was a favourite form of punishment for wife-beating. Many examples of vigilante justice, sometimes lethal, enacted against wifebeaters can be found in newspaper clippings from the 1800s and onward, with the full endorsement of society.\n\n[https://unapologeticallyantifeminist.video.blog/2019/05/21/correcting-notions-about-domestic-violence-in-history/](https://unapologeticallyantifeminist.video.blog/2019/05/21/correcting-notions-about-domestic-violence-in-history/)\n\nWe can assume that this was practiced in Europe as well. Likewise, Americans practiced shivaree and Europeans practiced charivari as a way to enable social censure of wife-beaters. Charivari was a historical folk custom expressing public disapproval of personal behaviour, where a mock parade was staged through a community accompanied by a discordant mock serenade. Sometimes the crowd would carry an effigy of the targeted man to a substitute punishment, e.g. burning. Sometimes the man who physically abused his wife would be abused by the community.\n\nThey would chant:\n\n*Old Abram Higback has been paying his good woman; But he neither paid her for what or for why, But he up with his fist and blacked her eye.*\n\n*Now all ye old women, and old women kind, Get together, and be in a mind; Collar him, and take him to the shit-house, And shove him over head.*\n\n*Now if that does not mend his manners, The skin of his arse must go to the tanners; And if that does not mend his manners, Take him and hang him on a nail in Hell.*\n\n*And if the nail happens to crack, Down with your flaps, and at him piss.*\n\nHowever, if a husband was beaten by his wife - the husband, in contrast, was also the subject of the charivari for essentially allowing it to happen. In France about 1400, husbands beaten by their wives were “paraded on an ass, face to tail.”  In England, a [mural in Montacute House](https://montacutehouse.blogspot.com/2012/04/skimmington-ride.html) (constructed about 1598) shows a wife beating her husband with a shoe and then a crowd parading the husband on a [cowlstaff](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cowlstaff). \n\nSamuel Pepys recorded in his diary, 10 June 1667: “in the afternoon took boat and down to Greenwich, where I find the stairs full of people, there being a great riding there to-day for a man, the constable of the town, whose wife beat him.”\n\nA Frenchman who traveled in England reported in 1698: \"I have sometimes met in the streets of London a woman carrying a figure of straw representing a man, crown’d with very ample horns, preceded by a drum, and followed by a mob, making a most grating noise with tongs, grid-irons, frying-pans, and sauce-pans. I asked what was the meaning of all this; they told me that a woman had given her husband a sound beating, for accusing her of making him a cuckold, and that upon such occasions some kind neighbour of the poor innocent injur’d creature generally performed this ceremony.\"\n\n[https://www.purplemotes.net/2013/01/27/charivari-sex-inequality/](https://www.purplemotes.net/2013/01/27/charivari-sex-inequality/)\n\nHmmm. So while a man could give his wife mild correction under the law, if he went too far with wife-beating the community would frown down upon him and punish him with the pillory, whippings and charivari. THERE WAS NO SUCH EXTREME SOCIAL OR LEGAL CENSURE FOR A WIFE WHO BEAT HER HUSBAND. IF SHE BEAT HIM, HE WAS THE ONE WHO WAS PUNISHED.\n\n*Myth #4: Husbands were owed sex with their wives. Marital rape was not illegal, and marriage as an institution was based around rape of women.*\n\nThe idea at the time was that there could not be such a thing as marital rape because as a married person you are owed sex from your spouse, i.e. conjugal rights. This applied to both men and women. People who believe that conjugal rights \"allowed husbands to rape wives\" and not the other way around haven't actually done any research.\n\nIt was based on the idea that **both parties** had a right to sex in the relationship, and this was exercisable in law by each partner in a marriage.\n\nThe Bible said:\n\n\"*It is* good for a man not to touch a woman. **2** Nevertheless, because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. **3** Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband. **4** The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband *does.* And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife *does.* **5** Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.\"\n\n[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7&version=NKJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7&version=NKJV)\n\nDo note the specific passage where it says \"The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband *does.* And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife *does.\"*\n\nAnd here's a quote from an article detailing the history of sex and marriage.\n\n\"A hundred years ago or so, if you took the statute books literally, the only people entitled to have sex with each other were people who were legally married. All other sex was against the law. Fornication (sex with unmarried people) was illegal; so was adultery (sex with a married person—but not the person you yourself were married to). Cohabitation—living with someone in a sexual relationship—was against the law, except for people who were legally married. Enforcement was, shall we say, something less than perfect. At times, it was almost nonexistent. And the rules were riddled with exceptions. Sodomy, on the other hand, was quite a serious crime; and the full weight of the law sometimes came down heavily on people who had gay or lesbian sex.\"\n\n\"Married people were not only *entitled* to have sex; they were, in a way, *required* to have sex. Of course, nobody checked on whether John and Mary were having sex every night, or once a week, or once a month, or never. But if either John or Mary did not perform at all, for whatever reason, the frustrated partner had grounds for divorce; or even perhaps an annulment.\n\n[https://verdict.justia.com/2017/01/24/sex-necessary-legally-speaking](https://verdict.justia.com/2017/01/24/sex-necessary-legally-speaking)\n\nHusbands faced divorce if they were impotent and unable to consummate the marriage, though charges were usually made years after the wedding day. There was a similar charge of frigidity for wives, but it seems that wives charging their husbands for impotency was far more common. Husbands had to show an erection to a court audience and sometimes attempt to perform sex with their wives as well.\n\n[Source 1](http://www.bu.edu/law/journals-archive/bulr/volume89n5/documents/HOFFMAN.pdf) [Source 2](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/05/18/the-hard-on-on-trial/)\n\nBeing incapable of performing sex for your wife could merit corporal punishment. One medieval husband wrote about his unhappy marriage and his impotence in a book called The Lamentations of Little Matheus.\n\n\"My wife wants it, but I can’t. She petitions for her right. I say no. I just can’t pay.\"\n\n\"Even given his sexual incapacity, Matheolus was subject to corporal punishment:\n\n\"Acting as her own advocate, Petra {Matheolus’s wife} puts forward the law that if a shriveled purse {scrotum} can’t pay because it’s empty, under statute recompense for that injury is corporal punishment.\"\n\n[https://www.purplemotes.net/2015/05/03/matheolus-church-wife/](https://www.purplemotes.net/2015/05/03/matheolus-church-wife/)\n\nSo what does this show? It shows that both parties had an obligation to provide the other partner with sex during the marriage, and could not deprive their spouse of it. If it was an issue, it was not an issue that solely affected women.\n\n*Myth #5: \"Men had the vote and women did not. Women's suffrage was a matter of women as a united group fighting for their rights against the evil men that kept it from them. Suffragettes were champions of equality who got women the vote. Etc, etc.\"*\n\nReally, I'm very tired of hearing this one.\n\nIn Britain, the right to vote was not only restricted by gender, but also by class. Property owners had the vote, the vast majority of men did not. In 1830, just 3% of the population had the right to vote.\n\nDuring this time, there were a few groups who were fighting for the vote to be extended to them, and one of these groups were the Chartists, who were active from 1830 to 1868. They were fighting for broad electoral reforms including:\n\n* a vote for all men (over 21)\n* the secret ballot\n* no property qualification to become an MP\n* payment for MPs\n* electoral districts of equal size\n* annual elections for Parliament.\n\nThey presented three huge demonstrations to Parliament, and their requests were denied every time. The restrictions were relaxed but not abolished. Benjamin Disraeli said when introducing the Second Reform Act of 1867: \"We do not live – and I trust it will never be the fate of this country to live – under a democracy. The propositions which I am going to make tonight certainly have no tendency in that direction.\"\n\nThere were also the suffragists and the suffragettes, who were fighting for the vote to be extended to women. Suffragists emerged in the mid-19th century and believed in peaceful, constitutional campaign methods. In the early 20th century, after the suffragists failed to make significant progress, a new generation of activists emerged. These women became known as the suffragettes, and they were willing to take direct, militant action for the cause.\n\nHowever, a huge amount of women disagreed with women's suffrage. So many women objected to the franchise being imposed on them that in the mere 18 months leading up to a 1910 parliamentary debate on women's suffrage, anti-suffragettes had managed to collect 300,000 signatures from women who objected to the franchise being imposed on them. Meanwhile, in the 16 years leading up to that debate, suffragettes only managed to collect 193,000 signatures of women who wanted the vote.\n\nA segment from the transcript of the debate:\n\n\"Still, for what it is worth, one finds that from 1890–1906 only 193,000 women signed Petitions to this House in favour of female suffrage, and that during the last eighteen months, a period in which a strong anti-suffrage association has been in existence, 300,000 women, some of them eminent women, have signed petitions against it, and to the effect that these proposals shall not be forced upon them.\"\n\nAnd...\n\n\"A rather interesting illustration was furnished by an inquiry which was instituted by \"The Sheffield Independent,\" a newspaper which I think itself is sympathetic with these proposals. This inquiry was addressed to the women householders of Sheffield. Twenty-three thousand papers were sent out, and of the replies 9,000 were in favour of woman suffrage and 14,000 were against it. The representatives of this paper reported that in many cases their emissaries were chased with violence from the houses by the female inhabitants under the impression that they were collecting statistical matter as the emissaries of the suffragist party.\"\n\nIt may be difficult to understand why so many women would reject the vote so vehemently, but this was an era where full citizenship rights like the right to vote were granted only to those with citizenship responsibilities like conscription (and sometimes not even then). In that historical context, the vote was actually viewed not just as a right, but also an obligation. So it was never really about men in power shutting women out of the franchise. It was about government having to decide whether to impose a responsibility on women that women as a whole *clearly did not want.*\n\n[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1910/jul/11/parliamentary-franchise-women-bill](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1910/jul/11/parliamentary-franchise-women-bill)\n\nRegardless of the lack of support for women's suffrage among women, suffragettes became extremely militant in their activism. In 1903 Emmeline Pankhurst founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) with her daughters Christabel and Sylvia, and the WSPU carried out a nationwide bombing and arson campaign. Between 1912 and 1915, hundreds of bombs were left on trains, in theatres, post offices, churches, even outside the Bank of England; while arson attacks on timber yards, railway stations and private houses inflicted an untold amount of damage.\n\n[https://www.historytoday.com/history-matters/sanitising-suffragettes](https://www.historytoday.com/history-matters/sanitising-suffragettes)\n\nInstead of being beneficial in supporting the vote for women, it was disastrous. Lloyd George said: \"The action of the militants is ruinous. The feeling amongst the sympathisers of the cause in the House is one of panic. I am frankly not very hopeful of success if these tactics are persisted in.\"\n\nTerrorism aside, Emmeline Pankhurst was also resistant to acquiring the vote for working class men, realising that this would be much tougher than winning the vote for \"respectable\" AKA upper-class women, and underlying the resistance appears to have been her contempt for working-class men. According to Sean Lang in his book on Parliamentary reform: \"The Pankhursts became stridently anti-male, ruthlessly dropping even the most loyal of their male supporters from the WSPU, and claiming, as Christabel did in her 1913 book *The Great Scourge*, that men were “little more than carriers of venereal disease”.\"\n\n[https://conservativewoman.co.uk/men-won-votes-women-not-suffragettes/](https://conservativewoman.co.uk/men-won-votes-women-not-suffragettes/)\n\nWhen WW1 came around in 1914, suffragettes also threw their support behind the White Feather campaign with the aim of shaming men into enlisting. Those young women went in for the kill, striking men at the very heart of their masculine identities, the bestowing of a feather telling them, \"If you don't go off to be maimed or die, you are no longer a man in the eyes of some brassy chit you've never even met before and will probably never see again.\" And many men went, because a woman's censure - ANY woman's censure - had the power to drive them straight into the teeth of death.\n\nBy mid 1915, it was clear that not enough men were signing up to replace the fatalities on the front line, and the Military Service Act was introduced in January 1916. By March 1916 compulsory conscription for all single men aged 18-41 was in place. In May 1916, the Act was extended to include conscription for married men.\n\n[http://www.eastsussexww1.org.uk/attitudes-towards-conscription/index.html](http://www.eastsussexww1.org.uk/attitudes-towards-conscription/index.html)\n\nIt was only at that point that the British government considered extending the vote to all men, as most of the propertyless, working class men that were conscripted into war during WW1 did not have the right to vote, and this was finally starting to be seen as the injustice that it was. In the trenches class divisions were eroded to the extent that class no longer had any real meaning and every man was the equal of each other in terms of sacrifice and service to one's country.\n\nMen got universal suffrage in 1918 with the Representation of the People Act, which enfranchised more than five million men over the age of 21 without regard to property or class. Women of all classes were piggybacked onto the Act, with an age restriction temporarily in place to prevent women from becoming a supermajority voting bloc, given that about 1 million British men had died in the war. Regardless, this brought more than eight million women over 30 into the electorate. And just ten years later, the 1928 Act (the act which gave women electoral equality) gave the vote to women at age 21, which added another five million women to the electorate.\n\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/has-everyone-forgotten-male-suffrage/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/has-everyone-forgotten-male-suffrage/)\n\nIntroducing the 1918 Bill, the Home Secretary George Cave said: \"War by all classes of our countrymen has brought us nearer together, has opened men's eyes, and removed misunderstandings on all sides. It has made it, I think, impossible that ever again, at all events in the lifetime of the present generation, there should be a revival of the old class feeling which was responsible for so much, and, among other things, for the exclusion for a period, of so many of our population from the class of electors. I think I need say no more to justify this extension of the franchise.\"\n\nThe Act was achieved not by the suffragettes’ terrorist tactics, but by fighting of men in WW1, when thousands of men from their many different backgrounds came together to fight the common enemy. This finally achieved what the Chartists, the Levellers and the peasants before them had struggled for in terms of eroding barriers of class. Without the sacrifice of men who endured the horror of trench warfare in WW1, class barriers would have persisted and at most the vote would have been extended only to elite, wealthy, propertied women.\n\nIn a later study of attitudes to conscription in 1939, one woman responded: \"In the last war \\[(WW1)\\] I never told one man that he ought to go. I tried to put myself in their place. If I’d been them I wouldn’t have gone. When I saw them going through the streets – all the young men – I used to think that they were being driven like cattle to the slaughter house. And they were, weren’t they? Fodder for the guns.\"\n\nThe common idea that all men had the vote, and that women did not, and that women's suffrage was a fight of women who were united against men working as an oppressive force to keep them down is an affront to these men who died in a literal war that secured universal suffrage for everyone (many of which, in fact, did not have the vote). It also ignores and erases the will and sentiment of many, many, *many* anti-suffragette women who actively rejected the vote and protested vehemently against it being imposed on them.\n\nFurthermore, the view that suffragettes were a valiant, fair-minded, equality-oriented group who got women the vote and whose activism merely amounted to firecrackers in barrels is an affront to any right-thinking person. The real violence and extremism of the suffragettes is barely, if at all, recognised by the general public, and this is partly due to attempts by suffragettes to sanitise their history.\n\n\"Laura E. Nym Mayhall, in her work on the militant suffrage movement, identified the importance of \"a small group of former suffragettes\" in the 1920s and 1930s, who created a highly stylised story of the WSPU and the history of suffrage in England, which emphasised \"women’s martyrdom and passivity\". The group set about compiling the documents, memoirs and memorabilia that now form the basis of the Suffragette Fellowship Collection held by the Museum of London.\"\n\n[https://www.historytoday.com/history-matters/sanitising-suffragettes](https://www.historytoday.com/history-matters/sanitising-suffragettes)\n\nAnd here we are now, in crazy world. According to the dominant narrative, all men always had the vote since the dawn of recorded human history, and they refused to give it to women because penis. The demonstrations of the Chartists, and the dead bodies of these men that were sacrificed to the unpopular idea of male suffrage (and who got votes for women in the process), have gone down the memory hole. The terroristic actions of the suffragettes, engaged in for the benefit of wealthy and privileged women only and for which they were barely punished, are the noblest of acts for the noblest of causes. And of course, the only reason anyone could EVER have opposed them was because of misogyny.\n\nedit: wording\n\nedit 2: Added some extracts from [w1g2's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/edyrf5/a_compilation_of_evidence_debunking_feminist/fbtays6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).",

    "text": "The wage gap is created by women, and reflects female financial privilege over men Assuming that men and women need about the same amount of money to live their lives and be happy, the wage gap is a good metric for the amount of money that women extract from men without using their own labor in the job market.\n\nThis allowes women to work easier jobs with fewer hours, and leads to better health outcomes, longer lives, and a better overall quality of life compared to men.\n\nThis money comes from one of three sources:\n\n1. **From welfare and government benefits** that are overwhelmingly paid for by men ([source 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/2kj8qu/the_benefits_gap_a_cursory_analysis_of_us_social/), [source 2](https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cpf/publications/pdfs/WP10_2013_Distribution-Income-and-Fiscal-Incidence_18062013.pdf)) but consumed by women ([source 1](https://www.creditdonkey.com/welfare-statistics.html), [source 2](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-97.html)).  It is no surprise that women have consistently voted to expand welfare programs to themselves ([source 1](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~iversen/PDFfiles/LottKenny.pdf), [source 2](http://conference.iza.org/conference_files/ELIT2008/bertocchi_g1882.pdf), [source 3](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30026099?seq=1)), using their own disproportionate political power ([source](http://cawp.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/resources/genderdiff.pdf)), since they are the ones who primarily benefit from it. \n\n2. **From marriage and dating**.  A tremendous amount of money is transferred from men to women in the form of free food, free entertainment, free rent, bills, and other benefits that women take from men ([source 1](https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/774083/sex-women-spend-money-seduction),  [source 2](https://www.fastcompany.com/1663594/women-dominate-the-global-market-place-here-are-5-keys-to-reaching-them )).  This happens through abuse, manipulation, and by taking advantage of misandrist social norms that are themselves often enforced by women and female preferences in the dating and marriage market (aka *hypergamy*).\n\n3. **From divorce, alimony, and child support**. A legal situation that was largely created and institutionalized by feminists ([source](https://recalculatingthegenderwar.tumblr.com/post/142883164331/most-powerful-american-feminist-organization-kills)) through the disproportionate political power that women have over men ([source](http://cawp.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/resources/genderdiff.pdf)).\n\n####**Encouraging women to support themselves (and criminalizing the usage of men for financial gain) would end the wage gap**\n\nIf men were no longer forced into the bread winner role, and women were forced to carry their own financial weight in life, it would cause two things to happen:\n\n1. Women would have a greater incentive to maximize their own earnings potential\n\n2. Men would have less of an incentive to maximize theirs\n\nThis would have to be accomplished on two fronts:\n\n1. We would have to eliminate the societal expectation for men to pay for everything for women (including paying for dates and financing mortgages).\n\n2. We would have to fix our divorce and child custody laws so that a woman couldn't take money from a man through divorce or from unfair child support laws.  Give men default 50/50 custody of their kids, and force the mother to support herself and pay for her half of the child rearing costs.\n\n>*\"The easiest way to solve the ‘gender pay gap’ would be to make it a criminal offence for a man to financially subsidize ANY woman, even his wife. Then women would have an incentive to work to the best of their earning potential regardless of the wealth of their male spouse.\"*\n\n[Source](http://www.fighting4fair.com/uncategorized/the-myth-of-wage-disparity/)\n\nHow do we know this would work?  Simple: trends among lesbian and unmarried single women already show this happening.\n\n####**Lesbian and unmarried single women often earn more money because they anticipate that they can't use a man for his money**\n\nNot only has it been shown that lesbian women earn more money than heterosexual women, the academic literature on this topic claims that the primary reason for this is because lesbian women anticipate that they will have to support themselves in the job market.  Since they cannot use a man to subsidize their income, they often make similar choices in the job market that men do ([source](https://wol.iza.org/articles/sexual-orientation-and-labor-market-outcomes/long)).\n\n>Decisions [that lesbian women make] might include staying in education longer, choosing a degree more likely to lead to a higher paying job, working longer hours or choosing a male-dominated career path where average salaries are higher. These choices “differ from those they would have made had they adopted traditional gender-based household specialisation roles\".\n\nA similar phenomenon has been observed in heterosexual women who are young enough to have never been married, as well as among older never married women (who are therefore supporting themselves instead of letting a man take care of them).\n\nIn fact, women who pursue their careers the same way that men are often forced to, commonly find that there is \"positive discrimination\" in the labor market that makes it easier for them to find jobs and get promotions compared to men ([source 1](https://www.recruiter.com/i/people-management-finds-widespread-hr-bias-against-men-and-overweight-women/), [source 2](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/112/17/5360.full.pdf), [source 3](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-science-gender/academics-rate-women-job-applicants-higher-than-identical-men-study-idUSKBN0N421420150413?irpc=932)).  As a result, *single women often earn more money than men do* ([source 1](http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2015274,00.html), [source 2](https://www.forbes.com/2006/05/12/women-wage-gap-cx_wf_0512earningmore.html)).\n\n>Without husbands, women have to focus on earning more. They work longer hours, they’re willing to relocate and they’re more likely to choose higher-paying fields like technology. Without children, men have more liberty to earn less–that is, they are free to pursue more fulfilling and less lucrative careers, like writing or art or teaching social studies.\n\n-- Warren Farrel (from the [second source] (https://www.forbes.com/2006/05/12/women-wage-gap-cx_wf_0512earningmore.html) above)\n\n####**But what about \"unpaid labor\"? Aren't men essentially paying for a maid or a nanny?**\n\nThis assumes two things, both of which I don't think are true.  First, it assumes that this trade-off is voluntary, and not one that is enforced primarily by women, who often prefer to be in charge around the house.  Studies indicate that women very often wrest control from men, *sometimes aggressively*, and that men are forced to take a back seat in most relationships ([source 1](https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle-2-15039/women-decide-to-rule-the-roost-1-1503380), [source 2](https://public.psych.iastate.edu/ccutrona/psych592a/articles/Vogel%202007.pdf)).   And second, it assumes that the amount of work that women do at home is somehow equivalent in value or labor to what they receive from men, which is doubtful given that you can hire a maid or a nanny for *less than minimum wage*.\n\nAnd even if you do buy these assumptions, it is still advantageous to do an equivalent amount of work from the comfort of your own home instead of out in the real world in the labor market.\n\nMen also do not see this benefit from cases **1** and **3**.  Judges are quick to force a man to pay for his ex-wife (violating his financial and bodily autonomy), but women are never forced to come cook and clean for their ex-husband in return.\n\nInstead I think you'll find that men are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves and their kids ([contrary to misandrist social stereotypes about men that are often enforced by women](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/11401315/At-home-women-treat-men-as-if-they-are-barely-competent.html)), and that the amount of work required to do so is fairly minimal and tends to be exaggerated (in fact a lot of the \"work\" is likely created by, and is primarily for, the wife, and not the husband, which is another topic in and of itself).  \n\nThe amount of work that a woman has to put in to make up the difference that she took from a man, however (in terms of job earnings and male labor around the house), is much more substantial, and women are often unwilling to replicate this work themselves (often taking advantage of welfare or money from a divorce).  As such, I think this is a situation that is primarily advantageous to women.  It represents a tremendous amount of privilege that women have in society.  And it is often enforced through hateful gender stereotypes and discriminatory legal practices.",

The fucked up thing is, this is a very hard job with a lot of turnover. I guarantee that within 3 months that position comes back open because they won't last.

    "text": "Infant circumcision vs adult circumcision Every time we are presented with a story of an adult, freely-chosen circumcision, it is important to remember that adult circumcision and infant genital mutilation are two entirely different procedures with wildly different outcomes — all they have in common is that the foreskin is destroyed. \n\nInfant circumcision typically removes more than half the motile skin of the penis, according to the British Journal of Urology (Taylor, 1996). Adult circumcision, by contrast, removes on average 25% of the penile skin. \n\nThe foreskin is naturally fused to the glans at birth and for an average of 10 years more. To perform an infant circumcision, a probe must be shoved into the acroposthion and all the way down to the corona/sulcus. It is then run all around the glans, separating the foreskin from it but badly damaging both surfaces in the process. From an infant circumcision, the glans becomes a giant, desensitized, discolored scar for the rest of a man’s life. \n\nAs such, men neonatally circumcised experience a high rate of sexual dysfunction by early middle age. Not generally true of men circumcised after their penis has fully developed. \n\nInfant circumcision removes a highly variable amount of skin, often lopsided or rough because there is so little to see and work with. Some boys are essentially degloved in their penis skin by incompetent operators. \n\nStudy after study after study has shown that infant circumcision has a serious complication rate of 2-10%, depending on definition. Using a standard rate of 5%, that means that in the United States alone about 70,000 boys are seriously damaged in their circumcision even beyond the standard foreskin destruction. (We circumcise 1,4 million boys a year, or about 70% of the total born.) Adult circumcision has a negligible complication rate. \n\nInfant circumcision almost always destroys or ablates the highly sensitive frenulum. Adult circumcision leaves the option to the patient, and most men opt to keep it.\n\nMeatal stenosis is very common in neonatally circumcised boys and men. It often requires further surgery to address the obstruction. Surgery so common that in the USA it’s known as “a boy’s second circumcision”. Meatal stenosis is almost unknown in intact boys and men. It is believed to be caused by a combination of direct abrasion of the exposed lips of the meatus, as well as diminished vascular irrigation to those lips by blood vessel destruction from circumcision. It is rare for neonatally circumcised boys and men to still have their meatal lips, which most often are the terminus of the frenulum. This is why Americans call what was the meatus the “peehole”, because it is a tiny, permanently open, round aperture. It looks nothing like the closing slit of an intact meatus, which protects the urethra from pathogens. \n\nBoys die every year from clinical infant circumcision. Effectively no one dies from clinical adult circumcision. \n\nInfant circumcision is designed to be severe, without regard to remaining function. Adult circumcision is designed to be cosmetic and interfere as little with function as possible. No one cares how much function baby boys lose from circumcision, because the goal is strictly foreskin removal. \n\nInfant circumcision triggers a severe healing response, which results in a thick scar and a dense fibrous network anchoring the scar site to the penile corpus underneath. This inhibits movement of the remaining penile skin, making masturbation more difficult and foreskin restoration efforts particularly challenging. This type of scarring and anchoring is almost never a consequence of adult circumcision.  \n\nAdults receive personalized pain management for their circumcision. Infants almost never do. Most infant circumcisions are still performed with no anesthesia or pain control, partly because of holdover beliefs that infants cannot feel pain, partly because doctors are impatient and do not want to wait for anesthesia to take effect, and partly because there is no entirely effective pain relief for infant circumcision. Even in those anesthetize, the pain is severe when the anesthesia wears off, yet no further pain relief is administered. \n\nInfant circumcision destroys parts of an immature penis in the cocoon stage, aborting the neurological development of the penis for the rest of a male’s life. Adult circumcision reshapes a fully-developed penis, with significantly less neurological impact, particularly to the glans. \n\nInfant circumcision is like forcing open a flower bud and forever ruining the flower from developing properly. Adult circumcision is like removing two petals from a bloomed rose. \n\nIt’s no wonder that so many neonatally circumcised men complain, while many men circumcised as adults wonder what the big deal is. The reason is that they underwent 2 completely different operations and got very different outcomes.",

    "text": "Masculinity under siege in schools, politics, online | Article in The Australian newspaper outlines the feminist war on men &#x200B;\n\n# Masculinity under siege in schools, politics, online📷[KEVIN DONNELLY](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/author/Kevin+Donnelly)\n\n* 12:00AM JUNE 28, 2019\n* [206 *COMMENTS*](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/masculinity-under-siege-in-schools-politics-online/news-story/7d0c3c50317c07b2198136f95c593bd7)\n\nIs there a crisis in masculinity? Based on an article by the American Jordan Black, “Masculinity in Menopause: The Emasculating Effects of Fatherlessness and Feminism”, the answer is yes.\n\nBlack highlights how, across the Western world, falling levels of testosterone and low sperm counts are contributing to significant changes in how masculinity is defined. Add the impact of so many boys raised without fathers and the global #MeToo movement that gives the impression that all men are inherently violent and misogynist, and it should not surprise that Black concludes: “We are not making men like we used to; in fact, we are not making them at all.”\n\nThe same is happening here, where similar forces are at work undermining masculinity and radically redefining what constitutes manhood. As Bettina Arndt says in her book *#MenToo*, men are unfairly demonised and attacked by radical feminists more intent on winning gender wars than peacefully coexisting.\n\nEven to suggest men’s rights are being undermined is to incur the wrath of the sisterhood. Victorian Women’s Trust executive director Mary Crooks wrote this week in Nine’s *The Age* and *The Sydney Morning Herald* newspapers: “Men’s ‘rights’ are about treating women as inferior; objectifying them by denying them any personhood. Men’s ‘rights’ are about being able to stalk, harass or abuse women online, on the streets, in the home or at work.”\n\nAnother example of this fatwa against men is how every time a woman is attacked or murdered the response is to blame all men and to suggest that violence occurs only because society is patriarchal and misogynist.\n\nAfter last month’s horrendous murder of Courtney Herron in a Melbourne park late at night, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said women travelling alone should be safe regardless of where they were or what the hour, and that crimes such as this were “most likely about the behaviour of men”.\n\nVictoria Police Assistant Commissioner Luke Cornelius mirrored the Premier’s views. He said: “This is about men’s behaviour. It’s not about women’s behaviour” — implying that, instead of the act being perpetrated by one demented evil soul, all men were implicated.\n\nWhen detailing the death of masculinity, Black also says the US education system is guilty of “encouraging feminine behaviour for both genders”.\n\nFeminist Camille Paglia makes the same point when she bemoans “the plight of physically active boys in a public school system dominated by female teachers”.\n\nThe Australian school system also disadvantages boys as a result of the feminisation of the curriculum. Research suggests boys, compared with girls, need greater structure and discipline to learn, especially in relation to learning to read, where the absence of a phonics and phonemic awareness approach puts them at risk.\n\nToday’s approach to education is more about “care, share and grow”, where teachers facilitate and students self-direct, manage their own learning and where competition is shunned. It’s an approach that favours girls.\n\nNot surprisingly, girls out­perform boys in reading as measured by the National Assessment Program — Literacy and Numeracy, and achieve stronger Year 12 results as measured by the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank. It’s also true that material such as the gender-fluidity Safe Schools program and the Respectful Relationships program being implemented in Australia disadvantage boys, as both present a negative and biased view of masculinity and manhood.\n\nThe view of boys and men presented is one that implies masculinity is inherently violent against women and that Western societies such as ours are patriarchal ones in which women are ­oppressed and treated as second-class citizens.\n\nVictoria’s Royal Commission into Family Violence reported that 25 per cent of family violence victims were men but the Respectful Relationships program implies it is only women who are at risk.\n\nStudents also are never told that such is the way the law now operates that men often are assumed to be the guilty party.\n\nAnother example of how the curriculum has been feminised is the way school programs present traditional male characteristics such as fortitude, courage, physical strength and mateship as negatives instead of being worthwhile.\n\nEven worse, many schools ban physically active and risky playground activities and behaviour, and it’s not unusual for primary schools to ban boys wearing ­superhero costumes on the basis that play-acting reinforces ­negative and potentially violent behaviour.\n\nMore radical feminists go as far as saying traditional male qualities lead to what *The Age* journalist Anna Prytz describes as a “man box”, a situation where men are constrained because they mistakenly believe they should be “unemotional, hyper-sexual, physically tough, stoic and in ­control”.\n\nInstead of accepting the feminist argument that the characteristics that typically define men are toxic, Black argues in favour of what he describes as “virtuous masculinity”. Paglia makes a similar point, arguing that feminists guilty of misandry should learn to respect and admire positive masculine qualities.\n\n*Kevin Donnelly is a senior research fellow at the Australian Catholic University.*",

    "text": "The Ministry of Love: Ongoing Gender Partisanship in the Department of Education   \n\nOrwell’s famous dystopia *1984* is often cited as a parable  about the banality of administrative evil. The ever-vigilant bureaucrats  of Oceania position themselves not only on the Left side of history,  but also at its *end.* To err from their ideology is treason.\n\nThe citizens of Oceania live in a state of self-imposed hypnosis  where they have to pretend that even the simplest of words signify their  exact opposites. The government agency that specializes in espionage  and torture is thus called *The Ministry of Love*. The Ministry views every sexual act as a potential crime unless proven otherwise via affirmative surveillance.\n\nImagine a federal agency that has invested itself with the authority  to monitor the most private details of citizens to root out sexual  heresy. Imagine a federal  agency which once contemplated [installing security cameras](http://pgbovine.net/OET-Draft-Grit-Report-2-17-13.pdf) in every classroom in order to monitor the facial and optical muscles of all students nationwide.\n\nThis agency was so devoted to its ideological mission that it never presented its [unconstitutional rules](https://www.thefire.org/did-the-office-for-civil-rights-april-4-dear-colleague-letter-violate-the-law/) to the American public to consult their opinion, considered itself to be [a superior alternative](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-students-are-fighting-for-title-ix_b_58e27314e4b0ca889ba1a848) to the criminal justice system, granted itself [universal jurisdiction](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/01/19/feds-find-buffalo-state-failed-investigate-alleged-sexual-assault-created-hostile), threatened many colleges with financial death unless they punished [constitutionally protected speech](https://www.nas.org/blogs/dicta/ocrs_new_sexual_harassment_guidelines_threaten_academic_freedom_due_process), sought to abolish the [“reasonable person” standard](https://reason.com/2016/09/12/ocr-to-frostburg-state-university-common), and created [a class of imitative bureaucrats](https://www.nas.org/blogs/dicta/gender_inequity_among_the_gender_equity_enforcers) in academic institutions to perpetuate an industry of victimhood.\n\nImpossible, you think? We have just objectively described the record  of the Department of Education’s civil rights branch, the Office for  Civil Rights.\n\nThe Office for Civil Rights (OCR) received bipartisan and  professional criticism for its unconstitutional actions during the Obama  administration. Formal critics include the [Federalist Society](https://regproject.org/wp-content/uploads/RTP-Race-Sex-Working-Group-Paper-Campus-Misconduct-Proceedings.pdf), [Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/crime-and-justice/report/campus-sexual-assault-understanding-the-problem-and-how-fix-it), [National Association of Scholars](https://www.nas.org/articles/nas_applauds_secretary_devos_decision_on_title_ix),[ California Governor Jerry Brown](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-browns-title-ix-veto-1508280834), [Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg](https://reason.com/blog/2018/02/19/ruth-bader-ginsburg-due-process-me-too),  [American College of Trial Lawyers](https://www.actl.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/position-statements-and-white-papers/task_force_allegations_of_sexual_violence_white_paper_final.pdf), and [Reason Foundation](https://reason.com/blog/2017/09/07/betsy-devos-rape-ocr-title-ix-campus).\n\nMoreover, courts that have heard cases involving OCR’s Title IX  procedures have often strongly denounced them. Examples include  condemnatory opinions from the [Second Circuit of Appeals](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/15-1536/15-1536-2016-07-29.html) and the [Sixth Circuit of Appeals](http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/18a0200p-06.pdf). In a recent [Seventh Circuit of Appeals](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/17-3565/17-3565-2019-06-28.html)  opinion, Judge Barrett stated that “Purdue’s process fell short of what  even a high school must provide to a student facing a days-long  suspension.” Professor KC Johnson [has covered the case in greater detail. ](https://www.city-journal.org/john-doe-v-purdue-univ)\n\nObama’s OCR espoused a particular brand of radical feminism.  According to this doctrine, taught across the nation in women’s studies  departments, men have brutalized women since the beginning of history.  Past oppression must be remedied through government intervention,  eliminating the due process principles that are meant to protect every  American.\n\nThe perils of government tyranny aside*,* the fundamental  assumptions of the “patriarchy theory” cannot survive rational scrutiny.  While it is true that women were historically denied various rights,  they have also been sheltered from grievous harm (combat, for example).  Also, analysis of federal aggregate data from the United States  demonstrates that women are [as likely to engage in sexual coercion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062022/) against men as [vice versa](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178916301446?via%3Dihub), which undermines the “patriarchy” narrative.\n\nAt any rate, past historical wrongs cannot be rectified by unfair treatment in the present, as the Eighth Circuit stated in [this ruling](https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca8/18-3077/18-3077-2019-03-06.pdf?ts=1551889833).\n\nOCR’s historical record speaks to its lack of fairness. The agency  authored a total of 255 resolution letters (formal decisions in a case)  from 2012 to 2019.\n\n[Pekgoz summarizes the circumstances in a Synthetic Analysis](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ea7b71_a751c44c74dc4e8fa8f35666ab9b81a1~mv2_d_3812_2108_s_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_3812,h_2108/PrintScreen%2C%20Synthetic%20Analysis.jpg).\n\nThe analysis shows that whenever OCR wrote a resolution letter  between 2012 and 2019 to adjudicate adversarial proceedings between  female and male parties, they sided with the female 216 times but only 9  times with the male (2400% more likely to side with the female). Their extreme partisanship is clear in every  aspect of Title IX.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Athletics.** The Department’s athletics compliance tests have been [rightfully criticized](https://www.nccivitas.org/2010/title-ix-blind-quota-system-or-how-kneecap-college-sports/)  for imposing unconstitutional quotas. The agency sided with female  athletes 63 times, but sided with the male only once between 2012 and  2019. The only resolution letter favorable for male athletes is the [Temple University Letter](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/03142257-a.pdf).\n* **Grading.** The Department sided with female students who alleged [discrimination](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/06112126-a.pdf) in [grading](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11162077-a.pdf) on [multiple occasions](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/15132147-a.pdf), while dismissing [very similar allegations by male students](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/07132238-a.pdf).\n* **Retaliation.** The Department sided with female  complainants alleging retaliation on many occasions. There are at least  23 letters in this category, such as the [Jacksonville State University Letter](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/04142086-a.pdf)  where the agency sided with a “falsely accused” woman. There is no  clear example of the Department siding with a male student alleging  retaliation on the basis of sex, [but dismissal letters do exist](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/10111376-a.pdf).\n* **Sexual Harassment.** Male students who petitioned the  agency to allege bias in sexual harassment disputes (either as the  accused, or the accuser) had a success rate of 1.1 percent during  2012-2019 (6/532). The Department was very aggressive when it came to  siding with female accusers while consistently dismissing the concerns  of accused males. This is despite male students often suffering  life-altering consequences, such as expulsion or a permanent notation on  their transcript, in addition to severe emotional distress. [Some have committed suicide](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/05/02/title-ix-cases-resulted-suicide-suicide-attempt-two-colleges-prompt-fresh-debate).\n* **Reasonableness.** OCR urged schools to get rid of the  “reasonable person” standard at least twice:  One letter involved a  female student who accused a male teacher of [staring at her breasts for 3-4 seconds](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/09141376-a.pdf). Another letter involved a costly systemic review because very young students [were playing “National Grab Ass Day”](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11131106-a.pdf) during play time. The agency even sided with a female student whose claims of sexual violence [were disproven via DNA evidence](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/15112115-a.pdf).\n* **Due Process.** While sending a dismissal letter to an accused male student, OCR argued that [“due process” is not covered by Title IX](https://www.scribd.com/document/426012564/Samuel-Meritt-University-Dismissal).  As long as the accused is a man, that is. Federal bureaucrats  aggressively sided with women who were accused of various sexual  infractions. On one occasion, the Department condemned a university for  allowing a male [to file a counter-claim](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11116001-a.pdf) of misconduct against a female student. Another time, the agency [threatened a university](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/01102089-a.pdf)  with loss of federal funding for pressing fraud charges against a woman  who made false accusations. There is also an example of OCR using [defamation theory to side with a female complainant](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11141175-a.pdf), even though the agency has never accepted any complaints concerning the damaged reputations of accused men.\n* **Single-Sex Programs.** Women are the majority of college students, but many colleges offer dozens of support programs [for women only](https://www.jamesgmartin.center/2019/05/identity-politics-versus-basic-logic-should-colleges-offer-affirmative-action-for-the-female-majority/).  Whenever male complainants challenge female-only programs, such as  women’s centers or STEM camps for girls, the Department has dismissed  their complaints on various pretexts. One popular pretext is that these  female-only programs cannot be challenged unless men specifically apply  to them and receive rejections, thus creating a putative victim.  However, OCR has resolved [procedural complaints in the absence of any victim](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/02152290-a.pdf) on many occasions, as long as the objective [was consistent with their agenda. ](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/03121217-a.pdf)\n* **American Psychological Association (APA) Guidelines.** OCR dismissed a Title IX complaint challenging the APA guidelines, which sought to [classify masculinity as a mental illness factor](https://www.dailywire.com/news/46458/foia-request-reveals-boston-title-ix-office-has-ashe-schow).  This was despite serious public outcry against those guidelines. In the  dismissal letter, officials argued that Title IX cannot be applied in a  manner that would interfere with curricular materials. That was false.  OCR has aggressively interfered with [the training materials](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11142219-a.pdf) and [the curricular materials](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/11131096-a.pdf) of [various colleges](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/10131040-a.pdf) as long as doing so furthers their gender agenda.\n* **Administrative Closure.** OCR has a rule requiring  the dismissal of pending complaints if similar allegations have been  filed elsewhere. This rule is rigorously applied [to male students to dismiss their Title IX complaints.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3479594-Stanford-University-09-15-2324.html) However, when [female students file complaints against their institutions](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/office-civil-rights-launches-investigation-university-southern-californias-handling-sexual-harassment-claims), administrative closure is not applied to dismiss their allegations.\n\nSome might assume that OCR has received few meritorious complaints  from male students. According to a Freedom of Information Act request,  however, the Department received [532 complaints](https://www.scribd.com/document/426016051/FOIA-All-532-Cases-With-545-Relevant-Allegations) from men in the sexual harassment category alone between 2011 and 2019.\n\nThe Department of Education became a hive of identity politics under  Obama and there is little evidence of improvement. The modest reforms  proposed by Secretary Betsy DeVos have not yet been implemented.\n\nResolution letters published under the Trump administration perpetuate the Obama doctrines. For example, [the Stanford University letter](https://provost.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/04/OCR-Redacted-Stanford-Letter-of-Finding.pdf) tried to eliminate the reasonable person standard. [The Butte-Glenn Community College letter](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/investigations/more/09132096-a.pdf) involved a retroactive review of many old complaints, demanding the creation of a complex bureaucracy. [The Buffalo State University letter](https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/media/OCR-SUNY-Buffalo-State.pdf) wrongfully claimed that off-campus incidents fall under the jurisdiction of Title IX, [despite case law to the contrary.](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-8th-circuit/1410731.html)\n\nUnsurprisingly, some politicians want to abolish the entire Department of Education. Representative Thomas Massie has [introduced a bill](https://massie.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rep-massie-introduces-bill-to-abolish-federal-department-of-education)  to do just that. While we cannot predict whether the Department will  ever be abolished, we must never cease our vigilance against our very  own *Ministry of Love.* \n\n*Kursat Christoff Pekgoz is a PhD student at the University of Southern California.*\n\n*James E.

    "text": "Men's Reproductive Options Dear oppressive tyrants, potential abusers, and willful Y chromosome possessors, let's talk babies.\n\nFeminism is, based on its record, all about the hatred of men. Not even in a personal sense, I am sure there are many happily married feminist women who love and support and value their husbands and sons, but ideologically they will generally advocate change that harms men or block change that helps men. And they are so good at it - after all, they've been getting everything they want for 50 years, they must feel like they are really on a roll. And boy are they.\n\nNow one of the best ways to harm men is to break down their connection to their family. It's hard/impossible to break down pre-existing family connections - a la family of origin - but the feminists have mastered destroying (most) men's capacity to to have and to have good relations with offspring.\n\nFor the feminist ideology - which I consider similar in no-God-required religious extremism to Bolshevism, and of course they share common roots - women must ascend over and at the expense of men in all spheres. It is not enough that now most college spaces are taken by women - and despite this many places are reserved for women, while none for men. It's not enough that girls from the earliest ages of elementary school and throughout school, on average, prosper relative to boys, or that the most disturbed and troubled and unsuccessful students are boys. (And of course, to the feminist, the education system isn't helping girls ENOUGH, hence the need for more propoganda and privileges for female students).\n\nIt's not enough that in the workplace, numerous - especially academic - workplaces are overwhelmingly female dominated, to the point that all senior positions are female held. It's not enough that we need board seats, directorship  seats, partnership seats, parliamentary quotas, public service quotas to give jobs to women. It's not enough that in many industries now if you're male and want to rise to the top you'd better forget it and go into private commerce. It's not enough that a male boss is terrified to discipline a wayward female employee, but a female boss can run the most abusive and unfair reign without anyone daring to challenge her.\n\nIt's not enough that men are portrayed in the media as inherently evil/untruthful, while women are portrayed as inherently virtuous/truthful, and it's not even enough that this is extended to college investigations, and even into the criminal justice system, where men are routinely convicted of assaults of women on her say-so alone notwithstanding enormous countervailing evidence.\n\nIt's not enough that young boys are ignored and miss out on college. It's not enough that those who men who make it through college have their career advancement blocked in many industries. It's not enough that they could go to prison for years if they get down and dirty with the wrong type of girl who is more than willing for some sex and fun today, but tomorrow may want a target for all the rage and angst she feels (a hardly surprising feeling given her crazy mother and the sexual revolution that falsely told her she can slut around without consequence). It's not enough a man might go to jail for another's  rage that bears no relation to him.\n\nBecause even a man whose promotion is capped can earn a steady income, in fact even a man who didn't complete college can pull himself up a bit by his bootstraps into financial security. Even a man who has been falsely accused - and less so, but even a man who has been falsely convicted can build a good family. He can put his family first, he can avoid vices and wastage of his earnings, and focus his emotional and financial attention on the betterment of his children. Now in a normal human system, this would mean he had a lot of good to look forward to over the years. The feminists can't allow this. They can't allow any man to fall through their net.\n\nSo the system (1) encourages women to sleep around before commitment (to weaken commitment) (2) financially rewards women for unfaithfulness - sexual or just vanilla desertion - by using (a) her husband's or (b) the taxpayer's money to fund her lifestyle should she choose to leave her husband. Hey hubby, you better not make too much of a fuss of your wife's couple of little adultery adventures if you know what is good for you.\n\nWhich leads me to the point of, what is a man to do if he wants to reproduce without being under the unfair thumb of a woman who knows the whole setup is exceedingly tilted to her advantage? Let me suggest options:\n\n1. Be a young person from the top 30% of families (money and non-craziness wise) AND be aware of the feminist gameplan - if you are both of these find another teen girl your own age and play your cards right. By the time you're in mid-20s if this is done she'll have so much to lose by ending it she wouldn't dream of it. Go ahead and enjoy your normal life as the maybe 10-20% of men in society who will be able to do this. When you're established financially, your kids grown, put a lot of effort into helping rearrange the system so men who weren't so lucky as you don't get screwed as much.\n2. If you're from a less good family or you started the relationship with women game later (ie. from early 20s onwards) sorry you're not going to be so lucky. You could marry, but the girl is going to have the upper hand and know it, and she's going to be likely a used tart with a bad attitude. Therefore although finding the right girl isn't out of the question, statistically its unlikely. In these circumstances I see two options\n\n(a) Surrogacy. Feminists are trying like crazy to shut it down as they realise how it changes power dynamics, ie. they can't use the family to terrorise and destroy men who go this route anymore. Two options here. 1. Do a self-planned surrogacy in California. There are basic costs you can't avoid for this - it will go up over time - but say $20,000 for eggs, $45,000 for surrogate, $20,000 for IVF (you can get guaranteed birth deals at some clinics). That's $85,000. I'd say it's theoretically possible to get a surrogate whose insurance covers pregnancy and labour medicals, and if you spent $15,000 by shopping around on legal costs, you could have it done for $100,000. I think this is an absolute minimum in Califronia, but likewise I'd think you were a fool to pay over $150,000 at today's prices. 2. Do surrogacy in a cheaper foreign jurisdiction, this could be done for $50,000 or conceivably even less. Colombia is a current popular cheaper destination, although its a bit like whack-a-mole with old jurisdictions closing and new ones opening as the feminists are forever trying to shut down this ungodly avenue for male joy. Note that nothing about taking this route would preclude you from either being a fag or marrying a woman  later on, although you might want to wait til your child's a teen to avoid a woman making some false allegation, a risk to consider.\n\n(b) Impregnate an 'iffy' girl because it's the cheapest way to reproduce. You go in knowing she's a crazy, bit of a slut, etc., but she's the best of a bad bunch. If you do this, do it while you're relatively young, late teens early 20s say. She might block you from seeing the kid, ever. She might make the kid hate you so much, even grown the kid wants nothing to do with you. She might fuck up the kid big time - this happens all the time and is the thing I hate most about feminism,because no matter how much better dad is he won't get custody. But at least you've reproduced. You could consider going overseas for a while and impregnating a woman who wants to keep the baby. This makes it much harder for them to use you as an involuntary meal ticket, as its hard for them to claim alimony when you live abroad. One option would be to have a baby with some Asian from the third world - whatever you do, refuse to acknowledge paternity, her hand is stronger if your paternity is recorded on the birth certificate, you can privately admit it while not signing anything - and later once the kid is a teen many countries allow rectifications of birth certificate, or DNA evidence could be used. Now you can have a nice normal arrangement where you pay her what for you is a minimal and manageable amount, what for her is enough for a (barely) lower middle-class lifestyle, and in return she gives you complete access to your kids when you come to visit on holidays. Just make sure she can't use her fornication and bastardry to try and claim residence in your rich country and whatever you do don't marry her - you can check your jurisdiction, not that many countries allow a woman residency just because she's bred in her home country with a man who is a citizen of the richer country, but I wouldn't be surprised if some Scandinavian countries or whatever would have allowed that. This can be successful but you must be tough but fair.\n\nThat's it guys. All these options suggest you've got your head screwed on properly, and your psyche in order. If you go into the kids/family thing without clarity about your goals and forethought, the 'poor victim angels' are going to bite your face off and the society will clap while it happens. Cheapest option: 1. have a baby with a not-so-innocent Asian women. She'll put the hard sell on you to marry her, help her migrate etc, don't buy it for a second, you're limited to seeing your kids for several weeks holiday per year under this model. That's while they're little - once they're teens, you could bring them over sans-mother, a lot of moms will go 'no way' on this, but I've seen many who genuinely care for their kids go 'great' and allow it despite them being lonely without the kid. Tried and tested option - surrogacy California. Cheapest option where you get full custody: surrogacy in a cheaper jurisdiction, I named Colombia, there are others. If you're not American, expect your government with its feminist orders to try to fuck you up around getting citizenship and passports for your kids from surrogacy. See a lawyer if you need to.",

    "text": "Meredith claims ‘retaliation’ for the Walkout as cover for her other, harmful actions against Google. [https://ainews.spxbot.com/2019/05/01/re-meredith-whittaker/](https://ainews.spxbot.com/2019/05/01/re-meredith-whittaker/)\n\n# re: Meredith Whittaker\n\n2019-05-01\n\n**Meredith traffics in activism and ideology, not empirical research. Her work aims to promote broad acceptance of her personal views.**\n\nPart of Google’s identity is that of a ‘data-driven’ company — where business decisions are made after consulting the best available information. Ethics is not a data-driven science; it deals with norms and values. Nonetheless, it is certainly possible for ethics research and ethics-based decision-making to be rigorous, and this is crucial in fields that profoundly affect most people — like technology, medicine, or government. This is part of the stated purpose of AI Now, and the reason for its major funding — a [grant from the MacArthur Foundation](https://www.macfound.org/grantees/953/) to produce “rigorous empirical research” in bias/inclusion, civil liberties, safety, and future labor impacts of AI. Over the past two years Meredith and Kate have identified research fields of focus and started hiring graduate students and postdocs to perform research in these fields. In the meantime, Meredith has published an annual AI Now Report and other reports, none of which have gone through peer review.\n\nThese reports, especially the [2018 report](https://ainowinstitute.org/AI_Now_2018_Report.pdf), are anything but ‘rigorous’ or ‘empirical’. They are review papers that begin with strongly-worded ‘recommendations’ which are as informed by author ideology as they are by any of the reviewed scholarly sources. As one very relevant example, the [2018 report](https://ainowinstitute.org/AI_Now_2018_Report.pdf) claims that\n\n>*“Technology companies should provide protections for conscientious objectors, employee organizing, and ethical whistleblowers. Organizing and resistance by technology workers has emerged as a force for accountability and ethical decision making. Technology companies need to protect workers’ ability to organize, whistleblow, and make ethical choices about what projects they work on…”*\n\nThis recommendation aims to justify employee leaks of proprietary business information such as the plans for Maven or Dragonfly, and employees’ choices to spend work time and resources to promote their political views. The relevant section of the report mainly cites two types of sources: previous editions of the AI Now report, and news articles about events at large tech companies. Of the articles, each article concerning Google involved protests that Meredith instigated.\n\nThe conclusion of the report asserts that employees should be protected for ‘ethical whistleblowing’ where ‘ethics’ presumably refers to the ethics of the employee (or, more likely, of the author). This conclusion cites a [UCLA Law Review](https://www.uclalawreview.org/private-accountability-age-algorithm/) article in support of this claim — although the article is limited in focus to whistleblowing of illegal activities such as discrimination (in particular, algorithmic accountability to avoid discrimination) or harassment. This misrepresentation of a scholarly source to justify an *a priori*recommendation rooted in ideology is, for lack of a better word, **unethical**. It is far too common of Meredith’s written work, in particular the 2018 report and the protest demand letters she has authored.\n\nWhile none of Meredith’s AI Ethics work has passed peer review, her review papers have been cited in peer-review work. The citations did not examine the report or its recommendations (here’s [one example](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsta.2018.0085)) but took them at face value. Although the 2016 and 2017 reports had recommendations more grounded in fact than in the author’s own biases and actions, and the 2018 report has not yet (as of May 1 2019) been cited in any peer-reviewed articles, it doubtlessly will, which will lend perceived credibility to the report even if many of the citations [do not support or consider](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2017/03/12/the-ethics-of-citation/#.XMbZ0JNKjUI) its more controversial/biased recommendations.\n\nOn Monday she will deliver an address at ICLR (a major machine learning conference) entitled “Why AI Needs Collective Action.” This continued ideological activism under the guise of ‘research’ is likely to continue as long as qualified researchers, Google senior leadership, and the tech press fail to call her out on it.\n\n**Meredith claims ‘retaliation’ for the Walkout as cover for her other, harmful actions against Google.**\n\nMeredith has been involved in pretty much every large protest or pushback at Google in the last year. Two of these — the Walkout and the contractor protest — were primarily about working conditions, and the Walkout involved coverup of deplorable, illegal activity. Organizing for better working conditions is an important reason for protest — you may think that Google employees have pretty great working conditions, and you’d be right, but sexual harassment is unacceptable in any workplace and our contractors often work in much less favorable conditions.\n\nThe other protests Meredith has organized and the leaks she has coordinated have harmed Google’s business interests and its culture. The least controversial of these protests, against [Project Dragonfly](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18114285/google-employee-china-censorship-protest-project-dragonfly-search-engine-letter), was unnecessary at best — the project had faced stiff internal opposition for over three months, was unlikely to ever launch, and had already had the bulk of its assets re-allocated. Meredith’s [publicized Medium post](https://medium.com/@googlersagainstdragonfly/we-are-google-employees-google-must-drop-dragonfly-4c8a30c5e5eb) exaggerated the scope and status of the project, allowing it to serve an example in her 2018 report of alleged failure on the part of Google leadership to uphold its own AI Principles, and a positive example of employee organization.\n\nThe protests against Maven and ATEAC were successful in kneecapping Google initiatives that did not align with her ideological aims. Both these protests enjoyed favorable press coverage claiming massive participation among Google employees. This participation frequently involved signing petitions or rhetorical pieces authored by Meredith and promoted on internal message boards, or attending meetings armed with talking points she authored.\n\n**Maven:** In March of 2018 a Google executive invited employees to attend discussion sessions about Maven and other AI ethics issues facing the company, including concerns with Youtube recommendation patterns, discrimination in Photos, ad targeting, traffic routing by Maps and Waze through residential streets, and others. Maven was easily the most-discussed topic at that time, and Meredith seized this opportunity to ensure that the meeting would be about pressuring executives on Maven, and nothing else. She recruited like-minded employees to sign up for and attend the (limited-capacity) sessions to amplify her own views and drown out opposing ones:\n\n>*“You likely received \\[executive\\]’s email, which lists the times and locations of the Maven (sic) discussion sessions (pasted below). These will be structured as small-group conversations. You’ll need to sign up below if you want to attend… From \\[executive\\]’s email it doesn’t looks like we’ll be getting an update about Maven’s status. However, the small group format should be conducive to talking about the open letter and 7 key concerns \\[link to talking points\\] (thanks for you contributions, everyone!) In the spirit of a productive conversation, we encourage those attending to prepare in the following ways:*  \n>  \n>*Identify which of the 7 concerns (or which others) are most pressing for you, and come ready to respectfully expand on your reasoning.*  \n>  \n>*Think constructively about what policies and principles the company could adopt to ensure that your key concerns are adequately addressed.”*\n\nThis advocacy was productive in derailing the internal meeting from a broad discussion of AI principles and ethics to a Maven roast, where each of her seven talking points were parroted multiple times in the small group sessions and in the larger format. Employees who supported Maven, or who were neutral about Maven and did not agree with the tactics of the ‘Cancel Maven’ group, were met with derisive comments from those organized by Meredith. Several weeks later, after more actions from Googlers including leaks to the press, Google announced it would not renew the Maven contract.\n\nThere were many reasons for Google to participate in Maven — not least of which being Google’s hoarding of US tech talent, many of whom would consider defense industry jobs if [compensation and benefits were competitive with that of Big Tech](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/technology/artificial-intelligence-experts-salaries.html). Meredith’s organizing succeeded in amplifying the anti-military sentiment in Silicon Valley (and other countries, although about 85% of Google’s full-time engineering staff is US-based) to dominate the discussion in a company with diverse views about the role of Google in [assisting the US military](https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-anti-pentagon-decision-will-kill-more-people-1532889656), and to control the headlines in a country whose views are [very much at odds](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2018/12/02/microsoft-will-give-us-military-access-all-technology-we-create.html) with that sentiment.\n\n**ATEAC:** More recently, Meredith’s [rhetoric](https://medium.com/@against.transphobia/googlers-against-transphobia-and-hate-b1b0a5dbf76) and activism led to the dissolution of the recently-created Advanced Technology External Advisory Council (ATEAC) for its inclusion of Kay Coles James, claiming her political views (based on three tweets) were not “a valid perspective worthy of inclusion in its decision making”. The views expressed in the cited tweets are, in fact, fairly mainstream for conservative America, which James’s foundation represents. The views condemned by the letter are part of [very active current debate](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/03/sports-stars-weigh-in-on-row-over-transgender-athletes) and [held by a significant number of Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/11/08/transgender-issues-divide-republicans-and-democrats/) (and most conservatives). If James’s is not a valid perspective, that means American conservatism is not a valid perspective (unless limited to certain areas).\n\nThis is chilling. While it’s true that much of the criticism of tech companies from the American right is overblown, often complaining about ‘censorship’ or negative stories about conservatives (like Alex Jones or [Rep. Steve King](https://youtu.be/FASQCjbvjI8?t=127)), it’s also true that conservative viewpoints have been shut down on platforms like Youtube even though they don’t violate any terms. Conservative voices in the room are also important for discussing the nature of self-regulation, government regulation, the military, spending, criminal justice, and so on. These viewpoints deserve a place at the table, and efforts to silence them are flat-out wrong. Joanna Bryson (a professor who works in AI ethics and is far more qualified than Meredith to speak on the matter) said that the dissolution of ATEAC was damaging to discourse across political viewpoints and that “[bullying and shunning \\[of James\\] are problems, not solutions](https://joanna-bryson.blogspot.com/2019/04/bullying-and-shunning-are-problems-not.html).”\n\nBesides currying sympathetic press coverage, Meredith again solicited signatures and activism on Google’s high-traffic email lists. Her activism in cancelling Maven and destroying ATEAC not only harmed Google’s business interests, it shut out viewpoints that do not align with her own, and diminished Google’s role in being able to influence policy across the US political spectrum. These negative outcomes were likely the final catalyst for her change in role, because of the timing, but that is as much ‘retaliation’ as is getting fired for chasing a customer out of a store because of their political views.\n\n**The question about Meredith’s role change is not whether it constitutes ‘retaliation’. The questions are:**\n\n* **Why did Google allow Meredith to draw a salary for years with little to no oversight of her work?**\n* **Why did Google condone her inventing a ‘research group’ with no members and no research, to qualify herself as an academic expert?**\n* **Who gave her alleged** [**strong performance reviews**](https://dailycaller.com/2019/04/29/google-retaliation-petition-drafter/) **for her AI Now work, given that her manager and org are not involved in AI Ethics or academic research, and given that her work is highly biased and not scholarly?**\n* **Why did it take so long for Google to change Meredith’s role back to Program Manager in the first place?**\n\nA Program Manager at Google can easily make [over $125,000 a year](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Google-Program-Manager-Salaries-E9079_D_KO7,22.htm) (Meredith has been at Google a long time and likely makes much more than that.) If you or I were to spend our work time and work resources to advocate for our favorite political views, how long would it be until we got fired? Six months? A year? That’s a long time to get paid six figures while doing nothing for your employer.\n\nYet Meredith labels what she has sown and reaped herself as ‘retaliation’. That’s not only dishonest and unethical *per se*, but distracts from the very real issues of harassment and retaliation that are (and should be) the focus of the Walkout and today’s actions.\n\nread original article at [https://medium.com/@googlersagainstdeceit/re-meredith-whittaker-4f626152a7e6?source=rss——artificial\\_intelligence-5](https://medium.com/@googlersagainstdeceit/re-meredith-whittaker-4f626152a7e6?source=rss------artificial_intelligence-5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe account posting the original article on Medium has been suspended as the typical strategy to suppress any voice of reason against feminists.",

    "text": "Feminism and the Law... *(P.S.: This comment was written in the fall of 2018 after reading a small essay by Rothbard on* [*LewRockwell.com (Click here)*](https://www.lewrockwell.com/)*, a major Libertarian Portal managed by Lew himself. I add to it a little bit for clarity. Its interesting because* [*Ayn Rand (click here)*](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ayn-Rand)*, a Libertarian and pseudo intellectual, is a hero of feminists…)*\n\nObjective truth appears to exist only in a limited “time/space”. Einstein’s theory has progressively been used as an analogy for our current cultural revolution. In this age of excessive yet incompetent “scientific vulgarization” and mass media “education through propaganda”, science is often the first victim. And law, as is moral, are both sciences, yet soft sciences, and therefore bend easily under constraints, especially when these constraints contaminate the core of Good Faith necessary to participate in our civilization.\n\nThe greatest problem with our increasing tendency to economies of scales, is that they are not well adapted to the social environment. And in this sense, a limited local community may more adhere to a set of limited but well controlled and understood references. Yet. Globalism, and its companion structure, Matriarchal organization, performs on the basis of infinite references. The truth can be objective, often ceteris paribus, but in infinite choices of references, effectively, everything can only be relative, since the degrees of dimensions offered in terms of experience tend to infinity.\n\nThe core strategy of the globalist social revolution sits strong on this premise.\n\nBut let’s go back to the 10 Commandments: does everyone really know right from wrong.\n\nOur 10 Commandments, even for those who don’t adhere to Christian religion, are at the core of modern Law. At each Commandments the Law has sown “Unless”…\n\n>*It  is primordial, when addressing these kinds of discussion, to understand  that the 10 Commandments, which are part of Judaism and Christianity,  are universal archetypes which have been expressed universally in most  early civilization, in Islam, Buddhism, etc… While not expressed in the  same manner, all religions have most of these basic laws within their  tradition as pillars of organization and respect of others. And in  Western Justice, while these 10 Commandments served as reference, other  concepts are part of the pillars of Democracy, as the concepts of rights  surrounding Private property.*\n\n**You shall have no other gods before Me, unless…**\n\n**You shall not make idols, unless…**\n\n**You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, unless…**\n\n**Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, unless…**\n\n**Honour your father and your mother, unless…**\n\n**You shall not murder, unless…**\n\n**You shall not commit adultery, unless…**\n\n**You shall not steal, unless…**\n\n**You shall not bear false witness against your neighbour, unless…**\n\n**You shall not covet, unless…**\n\nFor example, an easy one is “You shall not murder, unless in self-defense”…This is a Natural Law contextual adjustment.\n\nTo every Commandment, a “Vox Populi” would complete the “unless” proposition in different manners. And in today’s globalist world where every human on the planet appears to be American, at least in concerns of hopes and freedoms…, in an infinite number of ways, the variations would be endless…\n\nMany take these Commandments as De Facto, yet even our Laws, and Interpretations of, have modulated each of these Commandments as to allow for exceptions.\n\nIt is these sets of exceptions that take expansion as our sets of references become larger.\n\nAs we castrate our localities progressively, we cannot expect but everything to become increasingly relative and unmanageable, except through ill faith and corruption, fake-ness and appearance of integrity, but rampant with conflicts of interests.\n\nI read, last weekend an article on Customary Law by Rothbard (chief intellectual in matters of Law of the Libertarians)…I was intrigued by the following proposition which first presented: \"...natural law as void of adaptation to Context...\", and that Libertarian Justice should be one where the Judge both writes and interprets the Law….\n\nThis is where, despite its profound condemnation of it, Libertarianism meets with feminism. The patriarchal system we have created is rooted in the separation of powers. Legislators write the Law, Justices interpret it. And the inherent shortcomings of Justices writing their own Laws, as described by the expression “Judicial activism” frustrates many conservative minds…yet is a pleasure to the Feminist thought adherent.\n\nGlobalism, social economies of scales, Judicial activism, relativism all belong to the Feminist political sauce….\n\nNow, Rothbard explained that Justices need to be more hybrid and shift from Natural to Customary law in order to give good balance to context…\n\nYes, certainly…and while Moliere quipped: **Only Theater is real, all else is Comedy…**\n\nYet, Feminists always wanting to be right and win, they want the institution of Justice to be malleable in good order…having a Law enforcement and a Judicial 98% positively bias towards women is not enough, they want more…\n\nIt  may come as a surprise for those not familiar with the philosophical  principals of Western Law, but “Women’s Justice” is what brought  expressions of justices such as Lynching. Women’s Justice is Arbitrary,  its core structure is Emotion…its a Spontaneous Institution (which means  it took place spontaneously, without community discourse or reflection)  which precedes the Construction of Western Justice. In fact, women’s  justice was meant to address situations which could not appear to be  adequately addressed by other structured judicial institutions or expressions, as a last recourse (never as a first one)…it was: point the finger and lynch…a bit  like the #MeToo Movement.\n\nAnd worryingly, Rothbard  “acclaimed judicial intellectual” of the Libertarian movement explained  that there is no greater Justice than Women’s justice…\n\nAnd the Feminists to Claim: “**There is only one absolute Objective Truth, it is that women are always Right…the remainder is all relative**”.",
