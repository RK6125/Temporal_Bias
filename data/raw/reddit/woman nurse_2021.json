    "text": "Healthcare employees, what are some major red flags about a job in today’s world? I know that Covid has burnt many people out. I 100% understand people leaving/taking time away from any healthcare position these days. Without going into specifics, I was hired as a sort of “helper” in a long term care facility of 40 residents. I am not a CNA or RN, nor have training for that (current college student taking a semester off and working to save some money).\nAnyway, I’ve noticed that I tend to be handed jobs that are way out of my scope of practice. I’ve also noticed there is no core staff. There is only one core CNA and one nurse. One only started one week ago. Every other employee besides a couple supervisors and our manager is hired from temp agencies EVERY DAY. There’s a new set of staff every day. I’m suspicious why no one...works there??\nI’m starting to get burned out. I usually don’t have time to sit/eat/take my lunch until about an hour before my shift ends. Yesterday I found all the temp CNAs just sitting and watching TV in someone’s room while I found a woman that had fallen in her room and no one found her. This has happened 3 times since the two weeks I’ve worked there. Most of the supervisors just take “trips” to Walmart or a smoke shop during their shift? I’ve had temp employees ask me what they should be doing when I’ve only worked there a week and apparently am the most senior employee in the building. The one thing keeping me at this job is the opportunity to get the vaccine and the fact I’m becoming close with many of these residents because I spend the most time helping them when other people don’t. \nMy question is, are most healthcare facilities like this right now due to covid? Just no actual staff retained at places? Or is this a major red flag and I should probably start seeking better opportunities elsewhere?\n\nEdit: Most of my assigned duties include taking pulse/O2/temp and recording that 3x day, dishes, sanitizing building several times a day, serving meals. But lately it’s been lifting people into bed, helping them groom/dress because CNAs don’t, helping them take their medication, bringing people to the bathroom....along with everything else im expected to do.",

As I sat with her getting her into position, the anesthesiologist makes a rude comment about her having a bra on. I get it, if she were to have a c section the metal clasps could be dangerous, however my pt requested to keep it on, and if there were an emergency, a bra doesn’t stand a chance against me.   As the doctor was asking questions about her medical history, I helped her answer as she could barely speak through her contractions, such as “she has a history of wisdom teeth surgery, right (PT name)?”  after she got her epidural and was more comfortable, I left the bedside to go to the nurses station, where the charge nurse proceeded to tell me how the doctor was complaining the patient wouldn’t make conversation with him.\n\n\nWhat?\n\nApparently my patient was so “unfriendly” towards him.  \n\nBRO.

    "text": "When I was 16, my Parents Wouldn't let me Press Charges Against the man who Assaulted me. Now That I'm Turning 18, I'm Working Hard to Ensure I get Justice. My name is Wren, I'm a MtF transgender woman, and I turn 18 in less than a month. I've been on the phone with 4 separate people about this today, so I'm emotionally exhausted. I will not be including the exact details of what happened because it's too much to say it again for the 7th time today. \n\nI was 16 and in a residential treatment center. I was in the male dorm because my parents wanted me to be. I was sexually harassed and threatened a lot. Out of nowhere this guy rips me out of my chair and starts kicking my guts in while calling me a tranny and a faggot and that he was going to kill me. It was pre-meditated, he told one of his friends to watch before he did it, it was obviously unprovoked, and he threatened to kill me again while the nurse was taking my vitals and fixing my busted lip.\n\nAlmost a week later, he told me, \"If I ever see you outside of here I'm going to fucking kill you\" and that when he becomes a cop, if he ever pulls over someone like me he's going to fucking shoot them.\n\nIt was never reported to the police because the RTC had a vested interest in it staying small. My parents refused to press charges even though I strongly wanted to. I'm turning 18 though and will be able to press charges because I have rights now I guess. The statute of limitations for assault and battery is 4 years in Utah, and I think this counts as felony assault and child abuse because he was between 18 and 19 when he did it.\n\nI'm so scared that this is going to be some kind of spectacle and I'm going to get dragged through the mud. He wanted to join the military last I heard, and if he's with the army he might get a really good attorney. It's like fucking gasoline for any right-wing magazine. I imagine the headline would be, \"Queer Transgender Tries to Ruin the Life of Army Veteran 2 Years Later.\" I'm just really fucking nervous, and I'm not going to tell my parents that I'm pursuing criminal charges. They lost their right to be involved in any of this when they asked a 16-year-old how she would pay for her attorney, and said shit like, \"How do you know that being a cop won't be the thing that saves his life?\"\n\nI don't know... this whole thing is just unearthing a lot of shit that I didn't know was there. I just had to pretend this never happened for more than a year to preserve my own sanity, and now I'm getting hit like a freight train. I would really appreciate it if anyone who's been here before could offer some kind words.\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nWren",

    "text": "Privacy and mask wearing I’m a nurse who has been working throughout this pandemic in full mask, shield, and gown for 12+ hours a day. I have worn my mask religiously everywhere I go. You’d think I’d be ready for it to be “back to normal,” but I can’t imagine giving up the freedom and security I wear feeling it. \n\nI love the privacy. Strangers don’t know what I look like. Strange men at the gas station I go to every morning don’t know what I look like. I don’t have to feel pressured to awkwardly smile or say hello or any of that bullshit. People leave me alone and I can exist in peace. \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way?\n\nEdit: Can’t read all the comments but I get the gist. My post came from MY EXPERIENCE. I have severe anxiety and fear of strangers due to my past. The mask in public is my way of having any semblance of control. If it’s not for you, it’s not for you! If you can’t wait to get rid of the mask, right on! If you already have, I can’t stop you. I just wanted to start a conversation and hear what other people think, especially women. If you’re a woman who has never gotten sexually harassed, I’m so happy for you. If a woman having control over her appearance and comfort enrages you, I’m not sorry. If you took this post as a way to bash religion, I’m actually not surprised which is really sad. I shared my experience in healthcare to show that wearing a mask for an extended period of time is possible and not detrimental. \nI’ve truly enjoyed reading everyone’s comments and hearing about our shared and different experiences.",

    "text": "Britney Spears' conservatorship is the most extreme, heightened, distilled version of something that I think most women have experienced. That issue is misogyny in medical care and other professions.How many women have been patronized, ignored, and abused by medical professionals?\n\nUsually it's something like a doctor ignoring your pain, *even if it is the most extreme pain of your life,* because of course you are just a whiny, attention-seeking girl or woman with low pain tolerance and nothing is actually wrong with you.  \n\n\nOr it's a doctor doing shit like refusing to prescribe birth control pills to a teen or 20-something unless they get to stick their fingers in their vagina first, even though the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated 20 years ago that there is no medical need for pelvic exams to be performed on young women seeking hormonal birth control.\n\n  \nOr going to the ER while bleeding internally, and being made to wait 5 hours for a cat scan at the *EMPTY* ER, even though the blood is visually draining from your face and you are fainting when you stand, and your stomach is slowly growing more and more distended as the blood gathers in your abdominal cavity, because of course you are just a whiney girl who just has cramps or bad gas instead of, you know, a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst that is bleeding uncontrollably and will require emergency surgery and blood transfusions.  \n\n\nOr it's the psychiatrist who is re-diagnosing you with ADHD (re-diagnosing because the college you teach at doesn't believe that your ADHD diagnosis could be real and is making you get re-diagnosed by a second doctor) asking you how long you've been overweight before stating that there are cheaper diet pills than adderall, and saying that it is impossible to have ADHD and an advanced degree so you MUST be lying about one or the other.\n\n  \nOr it's the doctor who tries to make you pass a pulmonary functions test over and over again right after you spent a week on a ventilator, and doesn't believe that you can't blow the minimum force required, even though you also just spent over a month with one lung fully collapsed and you have a tumor pressing on a major nerve, causing all your muscles to spasm uncontrollably whenever you inhale deeply, and they refuse to prescribe you appropriate painkillers because \"there's nothing wrong with her chest\".\n\n  \nOr they strap you down to the bed when you have a ventilator in, and don't communicate to you what meds they are giving you, don't give you access to a call button, and don't give you a method of non-verbally communicating with the nurses and doctors even though you are fully lucid and aware of what is happening around you.  \n\n\nBritney was young and pretty. She was seen as girly and dumb, but she was also rich and sexualized.Then Britney shaved her head, and she hit a stalker's car with an umbrella when they wouldn't leave her alone. And she drove with her kid in her lap.And for that, they took away ***all of her rights, possibly for the rest of her life.***\n\nI can't help but think that part of this is that she was a young and pretty woman, so they saw her as a child. And being both sexualized and rich, they saw her as someone who doesn't follow certain norms/expectations, and therefore a threat.  \n\n\nWhat has happened to Britney is nothing short of a tragedy. The tiniest silver lining in this is that it has shown people how very real these issues are, by showing that *even one of the world's most famous pop stars* who has millions of dollars can be victimized this way, and effectively forced into slavery by the courts.  \n\n\nEdit:\n\nI'd like to thank user Esk313 for being the first to send me an inappropriate DM based on this post:\n\n\"Have you considered medication? Given you long list of ... 'complaints' as detailed in your post and your strong interpretations of the Britney Spears case, it really seems like your neuroses are getting the better of you. Take some time, step away from the internet. Focus on your mental health. Consider medication. Only you can take care of yourself.\"\n\nEsk313, not everything listed in the post happened to me personally, though they are all things that have happened to me *or* people I know personally. If you must know, I was recently an inpatient for cancer complications. I was on a ventilator from a re-inflation pulmonary edema after a massive pulmonary effusion - (tumors by my heart and lungs caused irritation that led to the lining of my lung filling with lymph fluid, until I had 84% of a gallon of fluid where my lung should be. When it was drained, the lung became extra permeable and began filling with liquid), and despite this I *still* had a nurse insisting that I was only in the ICU \"for attention\".   \nI also have a reduced response to opioids - I had a genetic test confirm this after I noticed it a few years ago, and yet it took several days of extreme pain, and me refusing to comply with further treatments before the hospital was willing to address the pain and switch to non-opioid pain medication.  \nBy assuming these issues are the result of unmedicated neurosis, you have reinforced the point I was making with the post.",

    "text": "The \"Husband Stitch\" So a few years ago my husband told me that the doctor who delivered his brother asked his dad if he wanted a \"couple of extra stitches thrown in there\" while her episiotomy was being closed. Of course I found this offensive and angering, and a joke in extremely bad taste. \n\nThis morning the topic came around again, and I mused that, back in the '70's, doctors might have actually *done* that shit. My husband scoffed at me and said \"No way,\" and I agreed. I was probably just being bitter bc his dad is a sexist asshole. (Ex: took pictures of other women in bikinis on a family vacation with the family camera, got them developed, and they're still in their photo box.) Out of curiosity, I decided to google \"husband stitch\" to reassure myself that it was an urban legend. \n\n**I was so. Fucking. Naive.**\n\nThe \"husband stitch\" was [totally](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/husband-stitch-is-not-just-myth#The-history-of-episiotomies,-from-popular-to-discouraged) [real.](https://granta.com/the-husband-stitch/) My husband and I just stared at each other open-mouthed for a second because it seemed like such an evil, misogynistic violation that it couldn't be real. But it is. \n\nFor those that don't know, the practice involves putting extra stitches in the vagina to make it \"tighter\" for the man's pleasure because men are still terrified that childbirth makes pussies loose. That's not true, and it also shouldn't be a fucking priority after you just had an infant. The practice can cause a host of complications for women, most frequently **pain during intercourse.** But that's a petty concern when compared to a man's right to fuck. This can affect husbands, too, because it really messes up their sex life. (Hope it was fucking worth it, asshole.)\n\nI took the practice to be separate from an episiotomy, which I thought was a medical procedure, but my husband made a great point: episiotomies used to be routine because they didn't want the vagina torn too much, and he asked me if I thought that was out of concern for the woman. \"No,\" he said, \"the interest in preventing tearing was **also** to keep the husband's vagina nice and tight and pretty looking.\" I had to admit that he was right. (And I was also secretly proud of him. I hit the man jackpot!) \n\nThe \"husband stitch\" is still performed today, and I truly wonder how many women even get asked or told about it.\n\nEven after being on the planet for 43 years, this practice still shocks the **fuck** out of me. One woman described \"laying there like a lump\" while the husband and doctor discussed the extra stitches, ignoring her completely. I always worry about being one of those stereotypical \"angry, man-hating\" feminists, but I'm so fucking tired of men thinking they have any amount of privilege or control over our bodies!!! This stitch shit is fucking crazy! \n\nIt's nothing but a subtle admission that a lot of men see women as non-sentient fuck-holes that only exist to pleasure them. Look at they way they flipped their shit about #MeToo, when it was made loud and clear that they don't just get free access to our bodies whenever it strikes their fancy. And i **know** women have it relatively good in America, but I can't believe that we still have this far to go. And to be brutally honest, I am finding it hard **not** to despise men just a little bit for thinking they're owed a tighter pussy because they were generous enough to let us have their baby. **Fuck that.**\n\nMy husband was appalled, too, but I really needed to rant at some fellow women. Thanks for putting up with me :) Stay safe and healthy out there!\n\nEdit: 20 seconds and the post gets downvoted. I'm gonna throw caution to the wind and assume it's a guy throwing a tantrum because he doesn't like being told that our bodies don't belong to him. How about that person simply respect us out of common fucking courtesy, since it's always the **obviously correct** choice, and just go on from there.\n\nEdit2: **STEPS TO TAKE TO PROTECT OURSELVES**: Fuck genital mutilation, ya'll! From what I have read, there are a couple of simple things we can do to avoid this bullshit:\n\n1. Find an OBGYN that you trust (good advice for all of us!)\n\n2.  Talk to them about how you would like your birth to go and try to establish some kind of plan. Keep it short and simple, say 3 of your most important thoughts. It's always helpful to bring an advocate with you (this is usually the husband if it's an obstetrics appt, but it can be anyone you trust and who knows what you want to achieve.)\n\n3. Ask the OBGYN **what their policy is regarding episiotomies.** Ask them how often they do them and how they decide that it's necessary. *Tell them you would prefer you don't have one if at all possible,* although sometimes they are needed in emergent situations. Use your voice, say that shit - doctors work for *you.*\n\n4. Tell them that you don't want the husband stitch, and if they try to laugh it off, tell them what you know about it and that it's a real thing. Don't let them intimidate you, you have the right to tell them what is and isn't acceptable. If you have an advocate or support, bring them too if it will help.\n\n5. This is unofficial, but I'm a nurse, so: **do your own research before your appointment. ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF**, because a lot of doctors (sorry if I offend, and I'm only speaking from *my* experience) are supercilious man-splainers that are used to having their ass kissed constantly. (And you should see the difference in the way most male doctors talk to female nurses vs. male nurses. But that's another post.) **Don't take that bullshit.** Ask them however many questions you want, make them explain anything you aren't sure you're solid on, ask about meds, ask about anesthesia, bring something to write on. If they order tests, ask them what they're for - doctors will order Bullshit tests to get a few extra bucks from your insurance. (I have seen this happen at nearly every floor I've worked on. It's especially bad if you have Medicare - they charge the fuck out of Medicare.) When it's all over, **ask for an itemized bill.** If something seems bogus, call the office and make them give you an explanation.\n\n6. Again: Use your voice. Advocate for yourself (and the rest of us ladies will benefit, too!) I can't say that enough. Don't let anyone blow you off or condescend to you, and don't leave until you have the information you want. **I love you guys! Stay safe and healthy and vaginally perfect out there!! I know it's painful And upsetting to read about this shit, but THIS IS HOW WE MAKE LIFE BETTER for ALL of us. You're amazing, and i believe in you!**\n\nEdit3: Guys, my inbox is freaking blowing up and i can't answer everybody. **Thank you so much for the awards and the kind words!** I was mortified by this and really needed to talk to some women (I've got some anxiety issues - but who doesn't after 2020), and you guys have helped me so much! Spread the word about this misogynistic fuckery to all the ladies you love of child-bearing years, and keep on being wonderful human beings! <3 <3\n\n**Edit 4: What can we do to raise awareness and hold doctors accountable?** I slept on this, and I have some ideas, but I also need your help. Here are my thoughts: I'm a member of the Satanic Temple, and they do a lot of activism regarding bodily autonomy. This issue seems to be right in their wheelhouse. They have funds and they have lawyers. I think it's worth it for me to email them about this - even if they don't pick it up right away, at least it will put the bug in their ear. I have a friend back in Boston who knows one of the ST founders, and i am going to get him to work this into a convo with Doug sometime. That's one way to raise awareness about this. But what else? How do we find women who have been victims of this? Do we set up a website where they can self report? Does anyone know how to do that, because I'm shit with that kind of thing. Are there any lawyers reading who could give advice? What do you guys think? Can we create a space where we can talk about/collaborate on this - maybe a Slack workspace or something? **What are your thoughts?**",

    "text": "I've had 3 abortions I've had 3 abortions.\n\nMy first abortion was when I was 18. My partner was using a condom that broke, but they never told me it did. I was not emotionally ready for a child. I had the abortion at 6 weeks 6 days\n\nMy 2nd abortion was when I was 19. After my experience at 18, I started taking birth control pills, and used a condom with a new partner. That condom broke. My partner immediately told me, and I breathed a sigh of relief because I knew I was taking pills. 6 weeks later I was 8 weeks between periods. I was not emotionally ready for a child. I had the abortion at 7 weeks 4 days.\n\nMy 3rd abortion was when I was 25. I was living in another country and thought I was absolutely in love with a man I met there. I found out he was cheating, with multiple women, and had lied about his background. At the same time of these other discoveries, I learned that I was pregnant and he moved to another city within days of me showing him the test results and had no way of contacting him. The one friend I had native to the country offered to help me. She took a day off of work (which is unheard of in this country) and took me to a medical facility. Her English fell short and my minimal understanding of the native language was utterly useless. I realized I was on morphine and escorted to a table with a black bagged trash can between the stirrups. The last thing I remember was a nurse kindly wiping my tears away while another told the doctor \"the foreigner is crying\". This was a devastating experience. I physically recovered quickly and my elderly neighbor brought me food for a week even though we couldn't communicate. Clearly my friend had asked her to check on me. I was not emotionally ready for a child nor did I want to have a child with a deceptive person. I had the abortion at 7 weeks and 4 days. (weirdly same as the 2nd)\n\nWhen I was 26, I was back in the States and was living with someone I'd known for years, who knew everything about my life, including the abortions, and loved me whole heartedly because the abortions do not define me or stain my character. We got pregnant. We were shocked, worried that we weren't ready, but knew we wanted to bring a child into the world together, and trusted ourselves to step up. Almost 8 months later, we brought our son home from the hospital.\n\nIf I was forced to suffer the failures of what sex-ed and frigid, uncommunicative parents taught me, I would not have been able to achieve any of my successes and my life (and the lives of any children forced to suffer my limitations) would be totally debilitated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to share my story because for so long I felt like this is a shameful part of my past. But you know what? I'm not ashamed anymore. I am so grateful for the choices I've been able to make. I am not promiscuous, I am not frivolous. I made choices based on whats right for me and now I make choices based on whats right for me and my family.\n\nI can't imagine being deprived of that choice.\n\n\\[this is a throw away account\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: **This community is amazing**. To those sharing your own experiences, thank you SO much for doing so. All of the kind comments and support GREATLY outweigh the negativity. The stigma surrounding abortion is a direct threat to a woman's wellbeing, safety, and their right to control their own life and body. It took a lot for me to write this post. I hope these experiences become easier for others to share, without feeling the need to do so through a throw away account. Be well.",

    "text": "Doctors told me I was faking being sick, turned out it was a ruptured appendix. When I was 9 years old, I went to multiple doctors that told my parents I was faking being sick to get out of school or that it was all in my head. All male doctors. The 7th doctor, female doctor, I saw decided to do a blood draw only to find out it was a ruptured appendix. I was rushed to surgery and told afterwards that I had less than a week to live when they caught it. \n\nI was a mess and this left alot of scar tissue in me. I had some pain due to scar tissue after the surgery but was too afraid of doctors to tell anyone. Over the next 15 years complications increased, including terrible back pain. \n\nI got married right before starting grad school. I gave birth control a shot but it made me super depressed so I got off of it. While I was on it, the scar tissue decided to stick together more. When I got off birth control and my body tried to go back to normal, the scar tissue strangled part of my reproductive system. I saw 4 doctors before one suggested we do investigative laproscopic surgery. That is when they discovered that my body had strangled my reproductive system. They loosened it as best as they could. Loosening the scar tissue did resolve my back pain which means scar tissue was pushing on a nerve for over half my life. \n\nDuring the strangulation inside me, my hip flexer cramped up. As you can imagine it wad very hard to do anything for months. So after the scar tissue was loosened, I was good except that my hip flexor was still tight not able to get blood flow. For 2 years I had extreme pain, nausea, and suicidal thoughts (while getting a PhD). Went to multiple doctors and specialist. All guys by the way. No one knew what to do with me, which was so depressing and hard. Finally a woman nurse suggested massage therapy and physical therapy. Today I am on the road to recovery and almost pain free for the first time in 18 years. Just in time to finish my degree pain free and begin to live a pain free life with my loving and supportive husband.",

    "text": "Think about adding tampons and pads to your children’s back to school shopping list and donate them to the school nurse. I am a school nurse and I have actually made this post before a couple of years ago but I just wanted to remind people. Our school, and most schools across the country, use to not provide any feminine products to students. Then over time they started to provide them a cost to students. I have always paid out of pocket to keep my office stocked and free of charge to any students who need something. My school now provides a certain amount I am able to offer without going out of pocket, but they are literally the cheapest products on the market and not something I would use. So I continue to stock my office with quality supplies. I work in a low income area. I tell this story often and was used in a letter I wrote to my school’s superintendent when I was advocating for products to be supplied by the school. \n\nI once had a student who came to my office a couple of times a day while she was on her period. I finally got to the point that I told her she really needed to come to school prepared because this was a cost on me. She told me her father (which she lived with full time- no mother) used quarters to pay for gas that morning. They had no extra money and she didn’t want to ask for the $8 to buy some. She said she just used rolled up toilet paper at home. And school was the only time she had actual pads. From that day forward I bought all of her feminine products until she graduated. \n\nThis happens all over the country. Please consider donating a pack to your school nurse to help any young woman in similar circumstances if you’re financially able to. Thank you.",

Once I was bleeding so heavily that I passed out and had to go to urgent care. No doctor I have ever been to seemed to care. I went on regular birth control pills and they made me feel like I was literally losing my mind. I gained weight and cried so much that I couldn't function. Eventually I just stopped taking them. I went on the nuvaring and that was back when they thought it was necessary for women to have their periods every month. The ring did nothing to reduce my cramps and my period became even more irregular, coming both during scheduled times and otherwise. \n\nI spent a few years suffering in silence until someone told me that you no longer have to have your period with Nuvaring. Ecstatic, I went to planned parenthood and got my very own period stopper! For three months I had no period at all and they were the best three months of my life!! Then, a month ago, something went wrong. Cramps started back up again, and my lower back started aching. My hips hurt and my abdomen became swollen. I started bleeding, but not normal bleeding, a steady but slight trickle of black, rancid blood. This went on for three weeks before I went back to planned parenthood. The doctor seemed unconcerned, did no testing, and told me to take my ring out for four days, put it back in, and I would be fine. I begged her to refer me to someone who would just give me a hysterectomy. I'd been in pain for three weeks at this point, and have had miserable periods for 20 years. She left the room, jotted down two names on an info sheet for Fairview women's clinic and had her lab tech deliver it to me. \n\nI called Fairview, they told me they had no idea who these doctors were. Then they called back to say oh, they made a mistake, they know those doctors, but the soonest I would be able to see them is A MONTH AWAY. I called my insurance company and asked if there was anyone else I could see, they provided me a doctor's name. I called and made an appointment for a consultation to have my uterus removed. Fairview's patient coordinator called me today and told me that actually, that doctor doesn't provide hysterectomies, so I'd need to just wait and do an appointment with one the original doctors a month away. My insurance drops me at the end of next month. So basically I'd be waiting a month with my horrific symptoms, get seen once, and then have to start over again with my new insurance. \n\nI broke, yall. I started crying and told her that I've been bleeding black blood and taking ibuprofen like candy for over a month now, and nobody seems to fucking care. My insurance is going to drop me and I'll have to start all over again. \n\nFinally, she put me through to the nurse line, and suddenly I'm scheduled for an ultrasound this Friday. \n\nI'm so fucking tired. I shouldn't have to cry and freak out and throw my humiliating symptoms around and try 4 different ways just to be able to see someone who can take this fucking thing out of me. I cannot stand the Healthcare system, and I hate being a fucking woman.",

    "text": "very gross encounter with my male surgeon background: i have a papilloma that needs to be removed, and they are confident it is not cancerous.\n\ni met with my surgeon today and it did not go well. the first red flag was that none of the staff were wearing masks. while the nurse was asking me general questions, she made sure to let me know that my surgeon is a \"good, god-fearing man\" and that i shouldn't be uncomfortable because of that. the surgeon finally walks in and he isn't wearing a mask. he told me if i had the vaccine he would like for me to remove my mask so he could do an \"old-school\" check-up. when i took my mask off, he said \"where did you get your mask? did it say made in china on it?\" to which i replied that i didn't know because i didn't check. he then said to me, \"well, they did give us the virus didn't they?\" i was severely uncomfortable at this point, so i didn't reply. he caught on that i was uncomfortable and hit my leg with the stack of papers in his hands saying \"oh, i was just joking with you!\" a medical professional should not be joking about covid like that, especially with a new patient who he just met. while he was giving me the exam, he said something like \"you're going to be one of those women who have several nodules removed throughout her life\" which freaked me out a bit. he apologized and said he shouldn't have said that and then moved on to say that he doesn't leave noticeable scars after surgery because he doesn't like leaving \"ugly scars\". the entire time, he held constant eye contact the way older men in positions of power do to try and break you in. i held the eye contact the entire time, and at the end of the meeting, he asked if i was a military brat because i am \"very well behaved\". i am 21 year old woman and he treated me like i'm some middle schooler. the worst part is that so far, he is the only doctor's office who will accept my insurance so it seems i am stuck with him until this whole mess is taken care of.\n\nedit: i got an appointment with a different surgeon, and the center i went to is going to report what he said to me during the exam and \"review\" if they want to keep referring people to him. i am in the process of reporting to my state's medical board as well!",

    "text": "A happy rant about being respected as a rape survivor by hospital personnel. I just wanted to share an experience I never thought I’d have. I’m currently in the hospital after having a stroke. When I was first admitted, I somehow managed to keep my jeans on (usually they’re the first things to go once I’m in a gown). It wasn’t until I got up to my room (instead of in the ER) that I was told to take off my pants to prepare for an MRI. \n\nI’ve never been good about speaking up for myself or my needs. Actually, I can’t remember the last time I told a doctor or nurse exactly what I needed or why. But this time, I took a breath, avoided eye contact, and half whispered, half slurred, “Would it be possible to borrow a pair of scrub pants? I’m a rape survivor. I don’t like not having pants on, especially when people I don’t know are going to touch me.”\n\nGuys. This man nodded solemnly, said he was sorry for what I went through and that it wouldn’t be a problem to find me some pants, and then he left. No questions. No weird stares or awkward silence.\n\nBut there’s more. All I mentioned was wanting pants. I said nothing about being weary of male employees or of my personal space being violated. I didn’t ask for anything to be notated or anything like that. But when my night nurse came in, she asked before she touched me in order to check my IV. She said, “I’ve been made aware of your history, and I’m so sorry for what you went through. I’ll be honest- I don’t know how to help. I know what you’re going through right now is scary enough without your history added to it, and I don’t want to do anything to make you feel uncomfortable. So we can learn together. You tell me what you need, and I’ll make it happen.” I was a little stunned. I hope I didn’t come off as ungrateful, because I’m pretty sure I didn’t say a word. \n\nThen the next morning, a woman knocked on my door and there was a man standing a good distance behind her. She introduced herself as a physical therapist and explained that the gentleman behind her was a therapist as well. Y’all, she asked me if it was okay for him to come into the room. And for the entire evaluation/session, she was the one that supported me as I tried to walk or whatever. He stood back and made suggestions. \n\nAnd then tonight, 5 days later, a male tech came in to check my vitals. Half way through, he looked at my name and went a little wide eyed. He apologized. Apparently he swapped with a female tech so that I’d be more comfortable, but he forgot since this entire hallway was his except for me. \n\nIs this was respect feels like? Anytime I’ve ever asked for a female doctor or nurse when I’ve been assigned a male instead, I get that look. The “why aren’t you over it” look or the “stop being so dramatic” stare. \n\nI can’t sleep at night because A. I already have insomnia and B. I can’t seem to calm down enough to trust going to sleep not knowing who is going to come into my room. So what did they do? My nurse moved her station to do her charting next to my open door. She promised not to let anyone in unless she woke me up first.   I’ve come to trust her the last few days, and she knows that. So she’s purposefully putting herself somewhere that makes life more inconvenient for her to make me feel more safe. \n\nThis all feels like a dream. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t recommend having a stroke. The right side of my body would definitely argue against having another one haha.  But I’m just completely astounded that I’ve been respected as a human being and as a survivor so freaking much throughout this admission. I’d say that I hope we get to a place as a society where this type of treatment is the expected norm, but right now I’m just too amazed to find any negativity in it. Thanks for listening to my rant. \n\nWell. Anyway. Considering it’s 3:44am and I can’t sleep, any one want to share similar stories?\n\n\nEdit: Hey guys! This blew up way more than I expected. Quite a few of you mentioned that I should let the hospital know how great their staff is. I definitely intend to! I actually used to work for the hospital I was admitted to (though it’s been 2 years, was in a different department, and a lot has changed there), so I know who to contact where it’ll be seen right away vs. going the survey route. I also plan to nominate them for the awards mentioned in the comments. Thanks for the idea!\n\nAs far as the name of the hospital goes, please message me for the information. I’m not comfortable posting it here as it could be used to find my location. \n\nAnd lastly, thanks for all the well wishes! I was discharged this evening with some sexy new walking aids, a fancy loop recorder in my chest to monitor and record my heart rhythm, and an appointment on Monday to start outpatient rehabilitation services. Over all, I’m doing okay. It still feels weird to know I had a stroke at 29, but what can I say... I’ve always been an overachiever lol.",

    "text": "example #799495872 women can't just complain about being sexualized and experience harassment without men making it about themselves I won't link to the post here, but I just saw it in r/all, a screenshot of a woman complaining about how when she tries to do nerdy stuff, guys end up being overtly sexual and hit on her, therefore ruining games like dnd.\n\nTop comment is a guy saying that male nurses get harassed too, so it's not a specific woman thing she's experienced, and to suck it up and deal with it. It has thousands of upvotes.\n\nI know this is old hat but come ON bro. No where in the post does it say it just happens to men, or even that the woman in the screenshot was complaining about \"all men\" (not that that would really matter), but they still made it all about themselves and dismissed this woman's experiences. \n\nCan't we just say one thing without having to put twelve disclaimers up saying that just because we are complaining about THIS specific thing, doesn't mean other things aren't also bad??\n\nIt would be bad enough that they \"what about'd\" this post but to end it with that's the just the way it is and to deal with it? I looked into the comments and they said well, it's less of a big deal now, so whatever, it's not worth doing anything more about. Jesus christ don't co-opt a post about sexual harassment women face by making it instead about sexual harassment men face, then kick the male victims down while they're out by invalidating what they experience TOO. And to be clear, commiserating shared experiences isn't what I'm talking about here – it's only when their experiences are used (usually by other men) to shut down discussions of it by women. \n\nTo my boys and those who present like boys, no one should experience sexual harassment. I'm so sorry some men only pretend to care if it means they can put down women in doing so.",

    "text": "How old were you when you were first sexually harassed at school? This is the story of when I had to strip in front of two grown women to prove I was, in fact, starting puberty.\n\nI was in 4th grade. 9 years old. I had started puberty just before my 8th birthday. My boobs grew a TON my first year.\n\nA male teacher took me out of class during a movie and sat me down in the hallway. \"You don't have to, you know, *do that* to fit in. You'll develop breasts soon enough. Tomorrow when you come to school, I don't want to see you *doing that* or i'm going to have to send you to the principal and get your parents to come and talk to you.\"\n\nI had no idea what he meant. But to him I was playing dumb.\n\nSo I was escorted to the principle's office. Confused and terrified.  It just didn't make sense. What had I done wrong?\n\nThe principle and my teacher sat in her office for a couple of minutes. When she came out she told me to stand up. I did. They both looked me up and down. Then they asked various office staff to look at me as well. Discussion in her office ensued. Without me.\n\nI was finally brought in. Alone with the principal.\n\n\"You are such a good student and you have so many friends, Emily. But you don't have to try so hard to impress boys. Boys your age are so much less developed than you are. You don't have to ***stuff your bra*** to draw attention to yourself.\"\n\nI had no fucking clue what that meant. \"Stuff my bra?\"\n\n\"What you did this morning before coming to school? Or in the bathroom before class?\"\n\nI asked her why I would do something like that. She got frustrated. Now I was mad because I was being accused of something I never even thought existed.\n\nAfter some blubbering from me, she took me by the wrist and marched me to the nurse's office. \n\nThey closed the bathroom door and told me to take my shirt off. I obliged. Then they asked me to take off my bra. I obliged. Frustrated and overwhelmed, the principal left.\n\nThe nurse helped me get dressed. I was sent home with a note telling my parents I should not wear any tight fitting clothes that accentuated my breasts, not to cause a distraction for classmates.\n\nI was deeply traumatized by this experience and is one of the reasons why I don't trust authority figures. This disgusting act opened my eyes to the fact that my breasts, at nine years old, were being sexualized. And I was threatened and punished for just having a woman's body.",

Someone commented \"Oh are you in nursing school?\" I am just really tired of people assuming Woman Studying Medical Related Thing = nurse. We can be doctors too. I have a lot of respect for nurses and nursing staff. But if she had been male, I guarantee that person would have asked \"Oh are you in medical school?\"\n\nSo my issue is 1) women can be doctors, and 2) nursing is not a lesser-than, default career for women.\n\nI guess I am a bit conflicted. On one hand, I am tired of hearing woman doctors called \"nurse\" (worked in healthcare and heard it a LOT) but on the other hand, I feel like I am part of the problem; demeaning nurses. That is not my intention and I don't know how to put this feeling into words.\n\nThoughts? Am I part of the problem? How do you say \"women can be doctors too\" without bashing the trade of nursing? They are hard workers and are underpaid and undervalued. And women are underrepresented in medicine and STEM fields. Ya feel me?\n\nSo yeah, let's discuss. I'm interested in what people have to say about this topic.",

    "text": "Birth abuse and the \"husband stitch\", not just a myth. A long needed weight off my chest. So I made an alternate account to share this story since I don't really want everyone I know to know about this. It's long, and graphic, but I need it out there.\n\nI'm 40. When I was 25 I had my first child. I had researched and thought I was well informed, I'd still argue that I was and that I had advocated for myself loudly. However, what I learned was that, when dealing with the medical community as a pregnant woman, often you're dismissed, scorned or flat out ignored. I'm in Canada, white, married, and was a \"suitable\" age to be having a child, but I was still treated as an inconvenience at best and as a total idiot far too often.\n\nAt about 20 weeks I started retaining a ton of water. My feet were also turning purple anytime I stood for long. As any concerned pregnant woman would, I went to my doctor about it. I was assured that everything was fine and that everything I was experiencing was normal. It didn't feel normal however and I brought it up again and again at every appointment only to be assured repeatedly, and with some annoyance, that everything was fine. I ballooned out, was exhausted all the time, I couldn't stand or walk for long, I was often dizzy. I figured it was *just* pregnancy. \n\nWhen I and my husband went in for my 37 week checkup, we didn't even see my doctor. Another doctor met me at the reception as I was checking in and said \"Oh, we're sending you to the hospital for an induction today.\" Shocked, I asked why and was told that I had pregnancy induced hypertension (used to be called preeclampsia) and that my blood pressure had been dangerously high and that I needed to be induced ASAP. I was stunned. How could this be, I asked, no one had told me anything about this! The doctor seemed surprised and checked my file again, she was sure, it was marked right here. I was told that I and my baby were in \"serious danger\" and that I *needed* to go straight to the hospital, no there wasn't even time for me to go home and get my bag, I'd have to get family to bring it. \n\nI left the office, broke down in the car, and my husband drove me to the hospital.\n\nI don't care to write every detail here, suffice to say it was a humiliating and painful birth experience. It took three days to have my baby. Highlights include being forced into labour with a \"balloon\" and a pitocin drip, then pushed up to nearly delivering, then \"turned down\" and \"shelved\" in a room for 24 hours until more rooms opened up and they were ready to deal with me. I was then \"turned up\" again and moved to a delivery room. I spent some time labouring in a bed in a hallway,  had countless people through the room, no one asked me if minded or even explained who they were. At one point this included a team of students there to observe. \n\nI am a loud and somewhat aggressive person and I asked lots of questions, but largely was dismissed, ignored or simply unanswered. I was given an epidural, not my choice. I was told it was medically necessary to preserve my and my baby's life. The epidural made it impossible for me to do more than sit up slightly. I wasn't able to get up, stand or walk at all. I could still feel plenty though, including when I needed to push. This wasn't surprising to me, I had a documented medical history of pain killers and freezing medications wearing off 3-4 times faster than average. The nurse argued that this wasn't  possible, that I was just \"overly anxious\". I told her I could feel the baby coming and she rolled her eyes and checked, only to see my baby's head halfway out. She told me to \"wait for the doctor!\" There was no waiting however and out my daughter came, barely caught by the nurse.\n\nShe wanted to whisk her away to another room to clean up, but I wouldn't have it and insisted she and my husband stay in the room. I was finally given my daughter and an intern doctor showed up to check me over. I was told to push once again and he pulled the placenta out with a sharp tug.\n\nDue to retaining so much water and then being hooked to a variety of drips for the last 3 days, my tissues were \"waterlogged\" and had torn quite badly when my daughter was born. The intern set to stitching me up. He told me that the damage was extensive, but not to worry, he'd \"stitch everything up nice and tight for my husband again\". I had absolutely no idea what he meant, I just assumed he was trying to be funny or something and blew it off, engaged in my daughter. \n\nEverything seemed ok and my husband, who had been by my side the entire 3 days, was exhausted and hungry and needed a bathroom. He said he'd be back in a few minutes, I said that was fine and I was left on my own.\n\nAfter a few minutes the nurse came back in and told me she needed to palpate my uterus to ensure that all the pieces of the placenta had come out. She took my daughter and placed her in a bassinet and then laid me back down and massaged my uterus. It was incredibly painful and I asked her to stop, but she insisted it was necessary and kept on. This apparently prompted me to pass a larger than acceptable piece of placenta (remember, I wasn't allowed to simply deliver the placenta, it was pulled from me). She called the intern back (I still had not seen an \"actual\" doctor) who proceeded to push at my uterus even harder and who ignored me completely, let alone my demands that he stop and explain.\n\nThen, he briefly told me that it was necessary that they get all the remaining pieces of placenta out and that I \"couldn't be feeling anything since my epidural must still be working\". I assured him that it was not, that I could feel *everything* and that I have a documented medical history of freezing and pain relievers wearing off faster than they should. He dismissed this completely and proceeded to push his entire hand up inside my uterus to manually remove any remaining bits of placenta. I screamed and demanded he stop, the nurse even told him he needed to stop, he insisted that he was \"almost done\" and kept on. After what felt like an eternity, he finished, and told me \"that wasn't so bad was it\". It was about then that my husband came back in the room. I was furious, in pain and upset and told him what had happened. Meanwhile, the nurse realized that I was bleeding. A lot. She called the intern back in and he started stitching me up, again. I had no pain killer and finally the nurse gave me nitrous oxide to inhale, only it made me violently sick. So I could choose between momentary pain relief, followed by pain and vomiting, or just enduring the pain.\n\nHowever, the bleeding wasn't stopping and finally an actual OB was called in. She was the first person to treat me like an actual person. She took one look at me and immediately began yelling at the intern. What had happened was that because of all the fluid in my tissues, when he decided to reach up inside me, he tore the skin inside my vaginal cavity in many places. I was hemorrhaging blood now. \"Shredded\" was the word she had used. The nurse asked if they should prep an emergency surgery and she said there wasn't time and ordered a team to the delivery room. She explained everything to me as she worked, she told me that she was trying to stop the bleeding by stitching the tears, but that this stitching was simply causing more tears at this point. She then told me that she was going to pack my entire vaginal cavity with gauze in the hopes that is would stop the bleeding and give me a blood transfusion. Then we would see how it went and hopefully, since I had given birth, the edema in my tissues would go down and she would be able to make repairs. So that's what she did.\n\nI spent 5 days in the hospital afterwards. The following day the packing was removed and further stitching done inside. I was encouraged to try to get up and move. When I stood up however, everything went black. It was another 2 days before I could get out of bed and have my catheter removed. I was finally discharged and sent home to recover. \n\nHealing took months. Again, my concerns about the pain and discomfort, this time with a new doctor, were dismissed repeatedly. The stitches were supposed to dissolve, but I have weird synthetic allergies and so they didn't. So 6 months post-partum, after I had finally demanded they at least look at them, an internal inspection was done which revealed a raging allergic reaction/infection and the stitches were removed over two separate sessions in hospital and I was placed on antibiotics. Finally, I healed.\n\nI figured I was finally done with all this, after a month more of healing, I was finally able to have sex again. Only, it hurt. A lot. I figured maybe things were just sensitive down there still, but it never seemed to get any less painful. I realized that some positions, ones that put more pressure or stretching on my perineum, were more painful than others. My husband said there was a wide ridge of scar tissue there and after some more intense self-exploration, I realized that what had happened was that the intern had \"stitched me up nice and tight\" alright, by sewing closed a half inch or more of my vaginal opening just above my perineum. I was beyond upset, I was furious. I made an appointment with a doctor that had some experience in this area and was told that, what I had suspected was entirely right, that it was shockingly common in women post-birth, usually they had no idea that it had been done to them until long after birth, and that I would require a surgical procedure to return things to \"normal\" and be able to have pain free sex again. However, she said, if I planned on having any more children, I might want to wait as often the birth of the second baby can fix the damage done.\n\nMy husband and I had always planned to have more children, but the first birth was...traumatic to say the least. I decided that I wanted answers for what had happened to me. So I started with my doctor who cared for me during my pregnancy. I made an appointment and met with her and asked why she hadn't told me about my condition? Why had she not informed me of my options? And why had she decided, without consulting me, that I would be induced at 37 weeks? Her answers were condescending and unsatisfactory. She told me that she had felt that it was in my best interest not to know. That first time mothers usually caused themselves more stress than necessary. She felt that, if she told me, that the stress of worrying about my condition would be worse than simply monitoring the condition herself. I asked why she had not discussed the option of medications with me, or any treatment options prior to an induction. She reiterated that telling me would cause greater problems and that she could not proscribe me a medication without telling me what it was for. I was shocked. I asked her how she felt ok with that choice? She had no idea what I was doing in my life. Only a week before going in I had been painting our nursery and had been up high on a ladder, felt dizzy and light headed, and had needed to lie down for awhile. She seemed surprised and said that she had asked me if I was working still when I had complained about the swelling, and so she assumed that I was \"taking things easy\" when she learned that I was not working. I was incredulous. I asked why she had sent me for an induction (without even being present at my appointment to discuss it with me) and she said that she had determined that was the best course of action at 20 weeks, assuming I carried that long. Afterall, delivering the baby was the \"cure\", so she figured it made the most sense to get to 37 weeks and then have the baby. I asked if we could have likely monitored my condition, tried medications to manage my blood pressure, and allowed me to go to full term and labour naturally. She said we probably could have, but why would we? I left, angrier than I had been to start, and lodged a formal complaint against her, as well as requested all my medical records from my delivery and hospital stay. \n\nWhen they arrived I was shocked to see there was absolutely no record of my having any stitching or anything. The blood transfusion was listed as \"due to extensive bleeding during delivery\" and there was no record of the name of the intern, any of the stitching done, or the 5 days I spent in hospital afterwards. My records had me listed as \"discharged\" the same day my daughter was born.\n\nI lodged formal complaints against both the hospital and my doctor (again), but nothing ever came of either of them to my knowledge. I was certainly never contacted and was dismissed as a matter of form whenever I tried to enquire. \"Someone will reach out to you if they need to.\" I was told.\n\nMy trust in the medical system was done though. We did decide to have another child (not an easy choice), and my pregnancy with him, and his birth, was followed by midwives instead. I had explained my previous experience and they took great care to explain every single thing. Every step of the way. My son was delivered at home, naturally, and with no complications, despite having the cord wrapped around his neck, his body and his arm several times. I double checked everything and was never able to take anything on faith again. I also refuse still to ever be left unattended while in medical care, for any period of time. \n\nOn the bright side, my son's birth did fix my \"husband stitch\" issue. I've been able to have pain free sex again ever since. And no one offered to stitch anything up afterwards for my husband's enjoyment.\n\nIronically, the pain from the stitching seriously impeded my, and my husband's, sex lives for more than 2 years, so it didn't even achieve what it was intended to. Because yeah, who finds it \"sexy\" when having sex with their wife causes her extreme pain?!\n\nWomen are routinely dismissed and abused within the medical system. So much of what happened to me was so clearly a result of a \"I'm the medical person, I know best and this is what needs to be done\". My opinions, my right to have knowledge about what was happening to me, my thoughts, my experience, even my own physical sensations were dismissed out of hand. My autonomy over my own body was stripped away from me in a very real, highly traumatic and painful way. I was rendered helpless and everything that happened to me happened without my consent, often while completely ignoring my saying \"no\". I was physically violated in an incredibly painful and humiliating way and it was treated as nothing more than a matter of course.\n\nI've never been able to get so much as even an acknowledgement of the reality of what happened to me. If my husband andy mom had not been there through it with me, I wouldn't have any outside validation, or belief, of what happened to me.\n\nThis is not acceptable. Women have every right to expect honest, forthright and respectful care while in the hands of the medical community.\n\nWomen have every right to expect to not be violated and traumatised while in their care.\n\nI'd like to believe this is no longer the same, that attitudes that allowed this to happen to me then aren't the same now.\n\nOnly, that's not the case. \n\nMy sister just had her first baby. \n\nAfter years of struggling with reproductive issues. Pain, heavy bleeding, cysts, etc from the time she was 12. She was told she wouldn't be able to have children, she was diagnosed with PCOS, she had her baby through a fertility clinic, but was able to carry and deliver her child herself. \n\nShe was just told she has stage 4 endometriosis. That she will never be able to have another child. That it's miraculous that she was able to have this one. That, had she just found out sooner, they could have tried various treatments, but now it's too late. She was furious. How could they say \"if only she'd gotten treatment sooner\"?! How could she have possibly been any more proactive? She has been inspected by more doctors than anyone I know, but because she was young (early 30's now) no one took her seriously. They put her on birth control, they told her \"some people just have painful periods\". Now she's demanding they remove her uterus. And still they say \"oh, but what if you want more kids?\" In one breath they tell her she can't have more children and in the next they say they don't want to remove her uterus \"just in case\". She insisted and they agreed, eventually, but only after she tries a medication that \"might\" help slow the growths. For 3 months. Medication that makes her incredibly ill. \n\nEven then, they're only agreeing to a partial hysterectomy, despite her having PCOS and having been warned for years that she will eventually need to have her ovaries out. So here she is, with a young baby and having to take medication she doesn't want, to be allowed to remove her own uterus she also doesn't want, and she's having to fight tooth and nail to just get that far, let alone the issue of leaving her ovaries with cysts inside her.\n\nNone of this is ok.\n\nWhy isn't this changing??",

    "text": "The AMS Consult *No spoilers, but this felt relevant, given today's other posts. Names, details, etc. changed for privacy and because I'm not a total jerk.*\n\n*Apologies, this got a bit long. Please still read it.*\n\n-------\n\nWhen I LARP as a neurohospitalist, things tend to come in waves. Not precisely the same things, mind you. The fine details are endlessly, fractally variable - but the broader brush strokes, much less so. If I see two cardioembolic stroke patients in a day, I can be sure that another five are waiting or actively infarcting in the emergency room. I diagnosed three new cases glioblastoma multiforme (1) in three days. Strangely enough, they all came in between 12-2pm on consecutive days, as if by USPS. A year ago, I diagnosed three new cases of HSV encephalitis in much the same fashion; in proper public health fashion, I confirmed that they all lived distantly from one another, and shared no friends, prostitutes, or toilet seats. \n\n\nNo week is more challenging, however, than the week in which you receive a pallet-full of altered mental status consults. I should take a moment here to point out that that this isn't the kind of challenging you went into medicine for - there's no wiping sweat off your brow, pouring fluids into beakers, or examining blood samples under microscopes till the early morning. You never get to stare up through the ceiling and directly into the eyes of the Almighty, announce that it isn’t this old bitch's time yet, and then - remaining sterile, of course - jam a needle into their living heart with both hands. \n\n\nRather, it's challenging because, in most cases, the obvious things have been done and there isn't much left to offer. There's very rarely an exciting or sexy diagnostic consideration left on the table (2). It only remains to be accepted that, after a certain amount of labs and imaging, obtunded patients will stay obtunded and worried families will stay worried. The patients that generally merit the dreaded “AMS” neuro consult are ill, and often have been for quite some time. Quite a few of these patients have also been alive long to have had lots of other conditions crop up and become chronic - so their medical burden is typically high, even prior to this most recent admission for pooping out a kidney or what have you. To add insult to injury, their labs have only recently become non-catastrophic. \n\n\nNot to be glib, but it's pretty rare that an MRI ordered by neurology will lead to the patient sitting up and starting a nuanced discussion of the Fed's interest rate policy - even if we do it with contrast. \n\n\nIn placing this consult, typically one of two tacit questions are posed to the neurologist:  \"well, the  kidney that's still inside them works, so what the hell?\" or \"We told the patient's family you'd make their brain work again.\"\n\n\nUnfortunately, I never did learn how to make a brain perk up and just start doing better. I try to relay this as kindly and early as I can. I think most of the doctors or families that request my consultation are left with the question \"Well, then what's the point of you?\" It's a good question.\n\n\nI find that the most useful thing I can do is to first make sure that nobody is trying to do a lumbar puncture without any idea of what they're looking for (3), and then take an accurate history. Almost as a rule, somebody else has already taken a stab at it, and reports to me that this frail creature who likely predates the cotton gin is \"usually really sharp.\" This almost always turns out to be the optimistic view of a family whose love allows them to look past things like: falling for repeated Nigerian prince scams; occasionally drifting across the double yellow line, or through a Costco while driving; trouble staying awake for more than 6 hours a day, ever since they saw an interacial couple on television and had their first heart attack.\n\n\nI'm being cynical, of course, and unfair in a few different directions. Not all consults are like that. Not all of these patients are elderly, or chronically confused, or easily explained away by the acute issues that brought them to the hospital in the first place. That's probably the worst part of the altered mental status consult - the knowledge that as soon as you get too jaded or dismissive, the hospital will give you something weird or complex to screw up.\n\n\nWhen the consult popped up on my phone, I could feel my blood pressure spike, just a little. For some reason, pages sent by nurses in our system always appear in caps, which grants a sense of urgency that is often unfair (4). As I read through the chart, things didn't get much better. Sure, the patient was in his 50's, but he was ill! He'd been admitted for covid a few weeks ago, and it didn't appear that a single end organ had escaped unscathed. Lots of his lab values had little red flags next to them, and I was already developing the bitter smugness that makes everyone cherish specialists so much. To top it all off, the notes made mention that the patient's *wife* was the one that thought he was confused! Did the hospitalist themselves even have a question for me?\n\n\nI've been surprised in the past, and so of course I went to see the patient - but don't imagine that I didn't do it without a lot of grumbling and quiet drama. I may have leaned my head back against a wall and sighed a few times. If there had been a rock or empty can in the hallway, I'd have given it a doleful kick (5). I donned my PPE with the pique of a high schooler that shows up for detention, but, like, doesn't even *care* about it because it's just so *arbitrary*. \n\n\nWhen I entered the room, I encountered a man of about middle age, with receding hair that flourished into a mullet, steely blue eyes, and a beard that plunged gracefully down his neck and into his chest hair without the faintest hesitation. He had huge, undefined arms, and the kind of belly that doesn't protrude necessarily, but bulges anyway due to omental abundance and organ huskiness. If we were in a drinking contest, he seemed to be the type that could lift a keg over his head and finish it with a laugh before I was halfway into my first rosé.\n\n\n\"Help you?\" he asked me with a lift of his eyebrows. I don't run into this greeting much in the hospital, and it charms me every time. The scrubs & coat costume I throw on usually signifies that I'm the one providing help, or at least pantomiming it while doing reflexes. So when patients offer, even as a figure of speech, it just feels nice.\n\n\nI introduced myself, gave my usual wave, etc. I asked him some incisive questions about his location, the date, why he was in the hospital. He replied - respectively - with:\n\n\n1) \"A shitbox hospital with half decent food.\"\n\n2) \"You're the fourth guy to ask me that today. It's _______. Feel like I oughta be testing you people.\"\n\n3) \"Fuckin' covid.\"\n\n\nThis wasn't how they speak to one another at Buckingham Palace, but he was hardly wrong. To tell the truth, I was having trouble actually detecting any confusion. I decided to earn my paycheck and ask about some semantics.\n\n\n\"If you would, explain this phrase to me: 'The grass is always greener on the other side.' \"\n\n\nI looked at him expectantly, and he returned the favor for a long moment, before finally asking \"The grass?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, as in a lawn or something.\"\n\n\n\"Kid, I don't give a shit about grass.\"\n\n\n\"Well, sure.\" I said. \"But I'm more trying to see if you can explain the idea.\"\n\n\n\"Well, I'm not a goddamn gardener. How about that idea?\"\n\n\n\"No, no, I get it. You're not growing heirloom tomatoes,\" I agreed. I was holding my hands up, as if in surrender, but I continued to press him, as some deep part of me had apparently decided that this was the hill I would die on. \"But maybe there's something in that yard that you do like.\"\n\n\n\"Like a woman?\" he asked.\n\n\n\"A what?\" Masks can cover many things, and are one of our best chances at curbing the spread of covid19 - but they do nothing for the squeak of a neurologist's voice as they completely lose control of the interview. \n\n\nHe repeated himself, and I stared for a long while, picking my way through an ethical minefield before finally settling on a lame \"Sure, I guess.\"\n\n\nAt this, he fixed me with a piercing look, cocking his head a little as he read deeply - and incorrectly - into my history and character. Then, in a much gentler tone: \"Kid, let me tell you something my daddy told me, ok? Dance with the girl you brung. It's that simple. Don't go looking around.\"\n\n\n\"No, no, not me,\" I prostest. \"I said *grass*, you’re the one that -“ but he cut me off.\n\n\n\"Don't get divorced, kid. You'll regret it if you do,\" he said, with the compassion of a man that had made mistakes, lived through them, and cared enough to pass those lessons along.\n\n\n\"...I won't,\" I promised, in the voice of a hesitant, scrawnier man who hadn't planned to make any mistakes in the first place. At this point, it was clear I had to change things up a little. Mentally setting my jaw and yanking my scrubs up to my nipples, I decided to be direct. \"Look, do you feel like yourself? Or have you been feeling a bit foggy?\"\n\n\n\"Foggy *how*?\" he asked, suspiciously.\n\n\n\"You see, they called me because there was some concern that you were confused,\" I told him. “But you don't seem terribly confused to me, so I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing in here, and how I can be helpful.\"\n\n\nWith that, his eyes narrowed. With a sort of icy calm, he asked me who exactly had said he was confused. I told him that the hospitalist had been “a little concerned,” and there was some mention that his wife “had been concerned as well.” This was, in fact, the most cowardly way I could have put things, and I didn’t do so by accident. Alarm bells were ringing in my head, and if I’d thought speaking in a Little Annie voice would have helped, I’d have done it in a second. Pride goeth and all that.\n\n\nAs it turned out, my fight or flight response had been dead on. When I mentioned his wife, I could feel the temperature in the room drop by at least 10 degrees. He flushed a deep red. The cords on his forearms stood out, and for a moment, it seemed as though the lights dimmed a little. Though he’d hardly moved a muscle, the inappropriate tenderness of a few moments ago was gone. Suddenly, he was fraught with power; a Talladegan Hephaestus who might lay me across his anvil in a rage if I didn’t watch what I said next. Underneath the hum of the jury-rigged HVAC, I swore I could hear the rumble of plates shifting beneath our feet, and the shriek of ball lightning.\n\n\n“*I see*,” he finally said, and his tone was measured. Since I wasn’t entirely sure of what it was he did see, I kept my mouth shut - but I was certain it wasn’t the sort of thing I’d be able to lay to bed with an MRI and some gabapentin.\n\n\n“This again,” he continued, his face beginning to twist with rage. “This shit just *does not end*.” He paused between these last words, giving each their own emphasis, before meeting my gaze with a look that both threatened and begged understanding. “Look, not going to college don't make a man confused.\"\n\n\n“No, obviously not. I mean, Justin Bieber right?”\n\n\n*Immediately*, a wave of regret washed over me. In both my head and my heart, I’d truly meant to say “Bill Gates.” But there appears to be some mechanism, some sort of infernal collapsible circuit just south of Broca’s region, which was built solely with the purpose of making me look like a shit head (6).\n\n\nSensibly enough, he ignored me. “Having a few hobbies don't fuckin' make him confused either.\" His voice was getting louder now. “But any time I don't do something her way don't make me confused!\"\n\n\nIf you’d diagrammed this last sentence, it would have looked like a spiral - but I took it in the spirit in which it was shouted. Cooler heads needed to prevail. \n\n\"I understand that, sir, but I think we need to calm down a little,\" I said. It was probably close to the right thing to say - but consider that I was also wearing foggy goggles, purple latex gloves, and a big blue trash bag that I'd cinched around my hips and shoulders. To my own dull horror, I further realized that, at some point,  I had hunched my shoulders and laced my fingers across my belly (7). Whatever was happening here had years of marital discord behind it. That kind of momentum simply does not get derailed by fancy little gentlemen in DIY Veruca Salt drag.\n\n\n“I know what this is about!” These last words appeared to tear something deep inside of him on their way out; his face wore the faraway tragic expression of a veteran that cannot forget. Then, in a desperate half-whisper: “I left the dog in Charlotte on purpose!”\n\n\n\"Oh, shit,\" said someone that sounded an awful lot like me.\n\n\n“We was in Charlotte in June and we took the goddamn dog with us. Well, when we got ready to come back, I told the dog get in the truck. It never listened, and I just decided, you know, fuck it. That dog never liked me. So I figured I’d just kinda… see what happened.”\n\n\nI stared at him.\n\n\n“So, like, we start driving. Truck’s pretty full, but she didn’t even notice he weren’t there. So I keep driving. I guess after a while it was kind of quiet and suddenly Carol just screams out ‘*Brantley*!’ Nearly drove off the fuckin' road.”\n\n\nI almost staggered at this latest revelation. They’d named the dog “Brantley.” Even dog murder paled in comparison.\n\n\n“She couldn’t believe we’d forgotten him. I mean, *I* could,” he said with a sort of shrug. “But I just kind of played along, you know? Acted surprised and all. I told her it was too far to turn around anyway - it was, like, two hours.” He paused for a second, as if realizing something for the first time. “Two whole hours,” he repeated, more indignantly. “And she says I’m confused?” \n\n\n“Look, I have to stop you here, sir. I’m not sure I can be helpful with a lot of this. I know I can’t, in fact,” I started, trying to build up an exit strategy. But he’d obviously stumbled onto a new line of reasoning here, and he was going to explore it to the fullest.\n\n\n“Maybe she’s the one that’s confused,” he suggested. “Maybe you oughta be having this conversation with *her*.”\n\n\n“No, I should not,” I said, essentially out of tricks.\n\n\nBut, in keeping with our entire conversation to day, he simply ignored me and reached for his phone. I placed my hand over his without thinking and his eyes snapped up to mine. I suddenly felt like a zookeeper that’s forgotten to give the resident hippo a warning pat before it’s nightly suppository. But I held my ground this time, reasoning that no matter the outcome - abrupt violence or continuing this interview with his wife added to the mix - I was going to die in this room. The only way out was through.\n\n\n“Just let me examine you, ok? If everything looks ok, then I’ll leave you alone. If not, then we’ll figure it out together. Just bear with me.”\n\n\nAfter a few moments of reflection, he decided to leave my skeleton inside of my skin, and we got started. It was almost a relief to start getting some objective data, after the swamp of emotional volatility we’d just waded through together. I was certain that after a few cranial nerves, pushes, pulls and taps to muscle bellies, our relationship would reach its natural conclusion. \n\n\nCertainty is generally idiotic, especially when you’re me, and double especially when you’re in the hospital. I showed very little promise as a neuro-ophthalmologist during residency, and so when I watched his eye movements, the words that popped into my head were “janky AF eye twerking;\" the more sober and literate among us would describe these findings as “gaze evoked multidirectional nystagmus, oculomotor apraxia, and likely saccadic intrusions.”\n\n\nHis motor exam revealed similar spontaneous oddities and incoordination. On activation - i.e. when he wasn’t lying still or clutching bed sheets in a sort of righteous fury - his movements were decidedly weird. I either hadn’t noticed before, or I’d written it off as agitation and fidgetiness. But it was in fact a tendency towards choreoathetosis which he was able to transiently suppress. \n\n\nTo get to the punchline, I’ll simply tell you that his sensory exam was fine, and his reflexes were pathologic. His MRI showed malevolent-looking, diffuse T2 FLAIR changes throughout most of the cerebral subcortical regions - including all of the gray matter you don't want to see involved. There were patches of roughly correlating DWI changes, tiny GRE blooms throughout with a particular affinity for the bilateral caudate heads, and no enhancing lesions. \n\n\nHis wife was a story unto herself, and it was a phone interview for the ages. There was a lot of material to get through regarding their marriage, their kids, her mother's loveless marriage, etc. But honestly, at this point, I simply had to know. I would have interviewed Brantley if I’d had to.\n\n\nFeelings and matrimonial history aside, I learned that he worked in a machine shop. I also learned that he did in fact have some hobbies, which included amateur metallurgy and electroplating. He’d started recently, and enjoyed it very much. “Amateur,” in this context meant that he’d assembled a shed behind his house, where he kept: plastic tubs full of chemicals; some car batteries; ladles; a leather apron; some old gold jewelry, in a gunsafe he’d welded to a bunch of weights. Things he had not invested in included: face or eye protection; lids for the tubs; a fan of some kind. \n\n\nI asked about some of the chemicals he used. At various times they'd included nickel, silver, gold, and cyanide. I did confirm this last one. \n\n\n*Mystery solved*, I thought. That’s it. Toxicity from exposure to aerosolized cyanide and God knows what else, yielding neuropsychiatric changes including (but not limited to) atypical eye movements, choreoathetosis, and irrational hatred of what I imagined to be a golden doodle. It made sense. It felt right. There was still plenty of work to be done, and I doubted I could entirely defer a lumbar puncture in good conscience - but it seemed as though I'd finally be able to put a bow on this particular psychodrama, and move on with my life. I started to wonder if this wasn't what Free Willy had felt like, as he leapt over the rock wall, into the sunset, and just over the head of a poorly supervised orphan. \n\n\nAs I started to relax, she dropped the final bomb on me. “Of course, he lost our *first* dog about a year ago.”\n\n\nBelieve it or not, he did have CJD. He had been acting oddly for some time now, and the bizarre, poorly considered metallurgy set up in the back yard was almost certainly more symptom than cause. I followed him, and watched his decline. His initial EEG didn't show me much, but the follow up study in 3 months showed me those classed periodic sharp wave complexes - it was the first time I'd seen them in the wild, and not my attending's file of interesting EEG snippets. I think I only fully relaxed, though, when the 14-3-3 protein came back positive. I spoke to his wife a lot during this period; I don't know how much she liked me, but since she'd only ever known me during the worst time of her life, and I couldn't blame her. \n\n\nAMS consults, as a rule, are an utter goddamn pain. There's no getting around it. And then, maybe 1% of the time, they're the single wildest ride you can take - and they're precisely what you signed on for.\n\n\n--------------\n\n1) A disease whose sole risk factor, based on my own anecdata, appears to be the possession of a beautiful spirit and/or a lovely family.\n\n2) Though when there is, and something interesting shows up in the CSF, I've found within myself a tendency to become a little overconfident. Given enough serotonin, I begin to undo the top 6 buttons of my shirt and slap coffee out of the hands of interns. Surprisingly, I never acted like this back in residency. The mask has been slipping.  \n\n3) this hasn't happened terribly often, but it has happened more often than anyone would like\n\n4) But not always. The single best one I've ever gotten was \"RECTAL NUMBNESS.\" That's it. Aside from the patient's room number, that was the entire page. Also, yes, they did have a cord compression.\n\n5) My shoulders would have been slumped, and it would have been raining, and The Lonely Man would have been playing probably.\n\n6) My theory is that this circuit - if we could only find it - would confirm not only that a higher power exists, but that its possesses an 6 dimensional, extra mean sense of humor.\n\n7) Picture how Patton stood during his famous speech, and then imagine the diametric opposite. Try it right now. I guarantee you that even if they were in another room or state, your significant other just went into a fugue, grabbed their phone, and began to download Tinder.",

A woman is admitted under Baker act (Florida's law for hold in re psychiatric illness). I saw her, she's medically stable but says she is suicidal. I say ok, as long as there's a bed we'll transfer you to our mental health unit until psychiatry clears you. Psychiatry comes in just after me and says, yea law enforcement contacted us, she has a warrant for something unrelated. She is clear for discharge to their custody.

Honestly, I thought she was a reasonable person, and aside from her suicidal ideation at the time, she would be fine in the real world.\n2. Gentleman comes in hx of schizophrenia and self-harm. Again baker act. Admitted to ICU because he needs sedation and they tube him. He's extubated and reasonably stable. Intensivist tells me (really the nurses tell me) they initially try for transfer to a med psych hospital but this is unlikely.

    "text": "Psychiatric first aid when you're not a psych The psych ward in my hospital has a sketchy reputation for keeping the patients who are supposed to be in the locked unit inside. It used to be a couple times a year you'd see the psych team slowly chasing an often stark naked patient across the carpark. I work in the lab adjacent to the psych ward and often have a front seat view of this semi regular occurrence and I have to admit have always viewed it with mild amusement probably as it was usually \"Naked Gandalf\" as he's known on a very gleeful jaunt.\n\nIt's got much worse lately though and the ward seems to have patients in much higher levels of distress than previously and the staff there are evidently struggling which I won't go into.\n\nI have been on a few advanced life saving courses and am pretty comfortable on how to deal with the majority of emergency situations in a first aid scenario before an actual medic arrives. None of these courses ever touched on psychiatric crisis and I haven't a clue how to approach these.\n\nToday I had an encounter that I wondered if I could get opinions if there's any way I could improve my response. \n\nAlso- are there any resources for medical staff in a hospital environment who need beyond basic first aid training how to respond in this kind of scenario? I'm frustrated there seems to be no equivalent to the advanced life saving for non physical crisis.\n\n\nApologies for the length of this:\n\n\nToday outside the entrance to the hospital as I drove home I saw a plain clothed man struggling to hold up a woman who looked to be having a seizure. I stopped the car and ran to help.\n\nQuickly a few things became clear- she was extremely distressed, not having a seizure but fighting him and he was covered in mud pretty scuffed up and utterly exhausted from trying to hold her. I asked him what was going on and he eventually managed to get out he was a psych nurse and could I call the psych ward. \n\nI kept a distance but helped push her back onto the pavement because it's an extremely busy road and she was trying to throw herself Infront of traffic. I started trying to say reassuring things whilst he's now grappling with her on the floor and he asked me not to. I asked him if he'd like me to leave and he asked me to please stay. \n\nAt this point concerned bystanders start stopping thinking he's hurting her so I reassured them he was a staff member and the situation was under control (he'd indicated for me to take his ID badge from his pocket to prove this at this point). Finally other random staff members start asking what's happening and trying to get involved as he just looked like a member of the public fighting this young woman so I reassured them too and dissuaded them from getting involved. I asked him if he'd like me to call hospital security but he said no. I can't stress how regularly close she was to getting hit by traffic during all this so I stand part in the road and push her back on the pavement each time she nearly succeeds whilst trying to be minimal contact.\n\nFinally other members of the ward arrived and helped with trying to restrain her- particularly unsuccessfully until someone jabbed her. During this one of them asked me to lock their car and he finally got his breath enough to thank me and tell me he was grateful I didn't leave but didn't get overly involved. They said they had it under control now and I left.\n\nIt keeps dawning on me that I've literally no idea what I'd have done if that nurse hadn't spotted her and what could I have done to try and minimise the chance she'd get hit by a car until trained staff arrived?\n\nIt's worth mentioning he'd been fighting with her a long while before I was passing and literally no one had stopped to ask what was going on or alerted anyone.",

    "text": "My patients mum pulled my hijab off Im a paeds nurse and was working on the covid ward. She saw a strand of my hair under my hijab (i dyed it blonde a couple days before) and told me not to cover it and just went for it. I had my hands full so I couldn’t stop her. And she did it in the anti room of the cubical where all of my colleagues saw. I think you could have heard a pin drop. And then she screamed “See!” And her son started crying. The funny thing is she is a die hard christian and was speaking about respecting religions but thought it was okay to do that. But yeah.\n\nEdit: guys. Im really feeling the love right now thank you for all of your kind words🥺 im sorry I haven’t replied to all the comments and to the messages i will go through them now ive just been recovering from my night shifts. To the people asking what happened afterward and whether i reported her - so when it happened, i ran out of the anti room, set the tray of stuff i had aside i started to sort myself out at the nursing station. The woman just went back into her cubical. The way she pulled my scarf off she ripped my mask off too so i was scrambling for abit. Like why would you do that to someone when you and your child are covid positive?????? My colleagues asked me then and there if I wanted to report her and i said no just because i was in total and utter shock, so cripplingly embarrassed and traumatised really. They looked absolutely horrified and in my anxiety ridden brain I couldn’t understand whether they were horrified at me or the situation. I was just trying to downplay the whole thing and make it super casual but inside i just wanted to die really lol so yeah. The next day i asked not to look after them again and soon enough that lady and her child finished their isolation on the ward and were then transferred back to their regular haematology and oncology ward. But yeah :)",

    "text": "Tasmanian Devil delivers a breech baby vaginally, and I lived to tell about it. I have to tell you guys this story, cause I can’t even believe it myself.  It's long as fuck.  Cheers.\n\n\n\nFor you in the OB world: tonight my meth-addled patient involuntarily pushed out a frank breech baby under conscious sedation. If none of that makes sense to you, keep reading, dear Redditor: it will.\n\nIn my 16 years as an L&D nurse, this night takes the cake.\n\n\n\nSo, coming on at 7pm it’s a little busy, but we don’t exactly need roller-skates yet…. I get report from Nurse 6th-Shift that there’s a patient coming up from ED. She presented to the ED with abdominal pain two days ago. They took one look at her mental health history (schizophrenia) and apparently decided that everything that came out of her mouth would be lies. She told them she was 37 weeks pregnant. So they did a chest x-ray, and an ultrasound that showed she was 33 weeks pregnant and then discharges her schizophrenic ass to the street.\n\n2 days later, she shows up back in the ED, and in the interim, she’s managed to find enough methamphetamine to blast her into florid mania. My report from 6th-Shift was “well, in the same 3 minutes she told me she is the Queen of Hawaii, an attorney, and that her parents owned the hospital.” Also, that her baby is alive, and that her mania turns into belligerent violence about every 5-7 minutes.\n\n“I told the ED doc that I can’t tell whether she’s in preterm labor or not because she tried to punch me.  I told them she should probably come up to L&amp;amp;amp;D so we can figure it out.” After 2.5 hours of this patient raising holy hell in the ED, they joyfully but slowly bring her up to us.  Excellent call, Nurse 6th-Shift.\n\nSpoiler alert: the patient delivered 2 hours later.\n\nTo my endless delight, the one thing that the ED doc did correctly in this situation was to order 2 mg PO Ativan, and 5mg IM Haldol. Bless his heart, he couldn’t figure out to send her up to L&amp;amp;amp;D for evaluation of her abdominal pain, but he sure as fuck could snow her for us.\n\nGood man.\n\nShe arrives curled up and filthy on a stretcher.  She is somnolent, but cooperative enough that we’re able to herd her onto the labor bed.  Just after the exasperated ED nurse leaves, the patient suddenly becomes very animated. “I gotta PISS!!!!” Writhing in the bed, clutching her belly: she is the very picture of labor. I put a hand on her rock-hard abdomen and my stomach drops to my knees.  At this point, all I know is: she had an ultrasound 2 days ago that put her at 33 weeks. In the 2 minutes since I met her, I am certain: she is going to deliver a preterm baby very soon.   Our one-bed well-baby nursery is woefully unprepared to care for a 33 weeker.\n\n60 seconds later, her contraction ends and she is snoring again (bless that man).  I swallow my moral outrage at checking an unconscious woman’s cervix, and find her to be 4cm dilated.\n\nAnd, fucking breech.\n\n(For those of you outside the OB world: Breech babies are NOT born vaginally. The risk of head entrapment is terrifying: the head is the biggest part of a baby’s body. This can quickly turn into dead baby hanging out of a vagina and that’s not a good look on anyone. So, any baby who is breech is universally born by c-section.)\n\nWhere were we?  Oh yeah: 33 weeks, breech, and psychotic with contractions.\n\nAs I jump up off the bed to start sounding the alarms, I see I now have a handful of meconium.\n\nNot meconium-stained fluid… Frank meconium. From a frank breech baby who is now pooping into its mother’s vagina.\n\nNow the score is up to: meth-induced preterm labor, breech, and meconium. This is the worst hat trick in the OB world. Fuck my life.\n\nSo, we start making plans to ship her out.  We gotta transport this train wreck to a facility that can care for a preterm baby.\n\nI call the community on-call Dr. LaLa to report our hat trick, and after her telling me 8 different ways that we just need to c-section her and ship the baby, I say “well, why don’t you (STOP FUCKING TALKING AND) head in here, and we’ll have some more information when you get here.\n\nIn the background, volume 10: “I GOTTA PISS!!!!” I run back into the room to keep the patient from tearing her IV out as she barrels for the bathroom like a bull with its balls in a pinch. I also discover that she is dribbling copious amounts of undiluted meconium down her legs, has wiped it on the siderail, and has generally made a baby-poo finger painting out of everyone and everything in the room. Pretty sure I have some in my hair.\n\nBy the time Dr. LaLa waltzes in, it is clear to everyone on the unit that not only is this lady not going to stay pregnant long enough to make it to the helicopter, she isn’t going to stay pregnant long enough to make it into surgery. Also, she is almost completely unresponsive in between contractions and definitely cannot consent to surgery. Once Dr. LaLa catches up to speed on the very real mess that we’re all in, she says “Call Dr. Crusty, whatever happens - he can help.”\n\nOh great.   Good old Dr. Crusty. (we’ll get to how he earned that name later.)\n\nDr. Crusty has two states of being:\n\n1. Look up the word “doddering” in the dictionary. His grinning face is the damn centerfold. It would be cute, if he wasn’t a surgeon. He dodders at everything. Walking, dictation, perineal repair, sharp dissection… I’ve seen him lacerate two babies’ faces in c-sections and yet still he is somehow in practice.  The OR techs give him the biggest needles they can find because he can't see the smaller ones.  He has a legit parkinsonian shuffle.  I could go on for days...\n2. His other mode is: \"8 SEMI-CONFLICTING ORDERS AT ONCE! JESUS CHRIST YOU INCOMPETENT NITWITS MOVE FASTER!\" His trauma response is to become consummate prick with snide, passive-aggressive remarks about our nursing skills that everyone just lets slide because he’s delivered most of this rural area’s babies for the last 40 years.  He reminds us, constantly, how much experience he has, and how good he is at doctoring.  That said, he is actually amazing at some stuff, and will accept chickens and lawnmowing in payment for his services, so I am conflicted about talking shit about him.\n\nBack to the scene:\n\nWe rush back to the operating room, and I scoop her onto the OR table between her wild contractions. Every 4 minutes, she becomes the Tasmanian Devil: writhing, howling, and grunting. I half-sprawl my body across hers to keep this tornado of a person from whirling right off onto the floor. Once one particular 60-second storm subsides - my dearest and actual most favorite anesthesiologist Dr. Diamond Rainbow pushes her mystical white light elixir of the gods into Taz’s IV.\n\nWe all felt a warm balm wash over us as the propofol solved quite a few of our problems.\n\nWith the Whirling Dervish asleep, we could turn our attention to more pressing things, like the half a baby butt peeking through this lady’s labia. (It was a girl, BTW. It was labia in labia. Labiaception for a minute.)\n\nI love Dr. Diamond Rainbow with every fiber of my little nurse heart. She somehow waved her magic wand and settled this patient into a sweet peaceful place: somewhere between methamphetamine, Ativan, Haldol, Propofol, Versed, and Fentanyl…a delightful rainbow of medications…  Taz was able to sleep soundly, but keep her reflexes intact.\n\nMaintaining just enough anesthesia for our Tasmanian Queen of Hawaii to protect her airway... meant she also retained the Ferguson Reflex.\n\nFor those of you who’ve never pushed a baby out: you know that feeling you get when you take a satisfying shit, your face contorts a little and your body goes into an animal hrrrrrrrrnnnggggg… and then you eject a pound and half of yesterday’s tacos? Yeah, that’s actually a reflex.  When you have a 5lb 10oz baby far enough down in your pelvis, your body knows just what to do with it.\n\nYeetus.  That.  Fetus.\n\nSo, the patient slept, and every 3 minutes would push quite effectively. I got to watch Dr. Crusty coach Dr. LaLa through a really lovely breech delivery. Out of hundreds of deliveries I’ve attended in 16 years as an L&D nurse - this is the third breech extraction I have ever witnessed.  Hat trick turned Triple Crown.  I felt like I was witnessing history, with that posterior shoulder delivery.\n\nOh yeah, back to Dr. Crusty.\n\nI’m tucked in against the patient’s hip, feeling her belly for contractions with one hand, and searching with the doppler for heart tones with the other, when Dr. Crusty yells out “Puje!!! Puje!!!” Which is Spanish for “push”. Not only is the patient unconscious, she is Hawaiian, not hispanic. I turn to glare at him over the patient’s draped leg, and see through his goggles that he hasn’t wiped last night’s sleep crust off his face. I catch his squinting, yellow-crusted gaze and mumble “she can’t hear you, Dr. Crusty. And she doesn’t speak Spanish.”\n\nAll’s well that ends well - the baby is fine, actually 37 weeks. The patient slept it all off and then ate everything in the fridge. CPS will be in later today to take her baby (also meth+ on Utox) to foster care, but for now she gets to coo and giggle at her cute little daughter. I took her an 8th cup of coffee before I left, with 6 sugars and 4 creamers, just the way she likes it.\n\n\n\nTL,DR: If a pregnant woman tells you she hurts anywhere between her nipples and her knees… it doesn’t matter how batshit insane she is.  Assume she is in labor, until proven otherwise.\n\n\nEdit: well this blew up.  Thanks for all the encouragement, guys.  I’ll keep writing if you keep laughing.  And, for the love, quit paying for fucking Reddit awards.  God bless /u/spez, but that dude doesn’t need your hard-earned money any more than I do.  Go donate $5 to The Bail Project.  If you PM me about it, I’ll send you a book when I’m done with it.",

    "text": "Doc said \"good job fisting grandma\" ER. Typical day. Full waiting room, ambulances lining up, phones ringing, call buttons being mashed like a Tekken game. I stroll into my assigned pod at the beginning of my shift with an ambulance already rolling in, medics eager to hand off and skedaddle.\n\nSacral pressure ulcer, fever, worsening fatigue. Sepsis? Sepsis. Standard order for a contracted bedbound elderly woman with 3 day a week home care and daughter as primary caregiver. She says her booty hurts. I bet it does. We'll check it out in a second. First, it's time for the ER special of 2 IVs, an 18g in the forearm and a 22g in the knuckle, cultures, antibiotics, COVID swab, the donut of truth, and consult to literally everyone that's ever sneezed near the patient and has an MD after their name.\n\nI grab the nearby ~~fresh meat~~ new grad nurse and say hey, it's time to clean grandma. Grandma finally had some pain meds and is in dilala land. Raul dutifully rolls contracted grandma, who doesn't notice because she's higher than the Wright brothers. Standard home care special, a dirty diaper that's saturated with urine, a few poop nuggets, a 3 inch stage 4 pressure ulcer I could stick my ^tiny fists in. Oh wait, what's that? A second ulcer? I see another large 4 inch hole just under the first sacral ulcer, but crusted with stool. A few nuggets must have escaped the booty and meandered on over to this second ulcer. I grab them with a bath wipe and gently remove the poop nuggets.\n\nAnd then I realize that isn't a sacral ulcer. It's a booty hole. She has a fecal impaction. And that's her rectum, stretched out 4 inches wide and full of rock solid poop nuggets that she can't squeeze out. Raul, the poor baby nurse, realizes this right after I do. He looks horrified. I think he might leave nursing and go become a hermit.\n\nGrandma is still high.\n\nI sigh, and with a gloved hand pick at the poop nugget mass. It's formed like monkey bread, individual balls of poop smushed together by the force of her gaping asshole. It tears apart quite easily, much like the monkey bread it's shaped like. Grandma groans a bit. I peel away the surface nuggets, hoping it's all just there at the edge. It is not. I can see an inch into her rectal vault, the forbidden monkey bread staring at me, her rectum still gaping. How much is in there? I can't leave her like this. How does her rectum hold that gaping shape? How long has she been like this? It's possible to stretch that much?\n\nI dig a bit deeper. It isn't a difficult task. Nugget after nugget is scooped out. Grandma says it feels better now. I keep scooping. My whole hand slips easily in without actually touching the walls of her intestines. I am wrist deep inside an elderly woman, making eye contact with a freshly minted nurse of just a few weeks, wishing I had finished my coffee before this so I could properly comprehend what was going on.\n\nAfter an eternity, I've scooped what looks to me to be about a pound or more of stool out of grandma. It's a scale bed, so I weigh her after. 1.3 lb difference. She says she feels much better. I'm sure she does. Her butthole appears to be shrinking down to a normal size, but I'm still concerned.\n\nThe doctor comes back in to evaluate the pressure ulcer, since I told him to wait until I've cleaned her. He looks at me, direct eye contact.\n\n\"Good job fisting grandma.\"\n\nI'm offered a fist bump. I decline. I go finish my coffee, and wonder what the next 11 hours of my shift will bring. Raul avoids eye contact with me for awhile.\n\nMerry Christmas, may your grandma not need to be fisted in the ER for a fecal impaction. And please, for the love of all things holy, give grandma a stool softener if she takes enough Percocet to make Future bat an eye. Otherwise she'll get disimpacted by an undercaffeinated ER nurse when trying to assess the pressure ulcer she acquired from family being too busy to turn her during the holidays.",

    "text": "I feel like a good nurse today I had a pt retaining urine, the bladder scanner was just reading more than 1L. I tried everything to make this woman pee, she was bed bound so I brought in the lift to get her to the commode and yayyyy 600ml! Awesome. I bladder scan again, still too much for the scanner to pick up. So I talked to her about straight cath. She screamed no, she was so scared. I had the doctor come talk to her (no small feat during night shift). I drew out diagrams of why this was dangerous. She still was refusing. At 6am I let her play with the catheter, and see how small it was, explained the procedure, everything. Finally she agreed to let me try, as long as another nurse held her hand. I pulled off 1700ml from her bladder. Wow.\n\nThe next night she kept saying over and over how much she appreciated my patience and explanation. How I was gentle when doing the procedure. How I listened when she didn't want the pure wick or a Foley. She called me her hero. I didn't know how to deal with that praise face to face, but I felt like I made her care better. Made her comfortable. And although I still freeze up with a code, or a seizure, 6 months out of college I feel like I did my job well for that pt. And I am a good nurse.\n\n\nEdit: I don't have time to thank everyone, but really thank you all.",

    "text": "I'm out of empathy. One of my colleagues asked me to help turn and change her patient yesterday. Thirty-nine year old woman, unvaccinated, hit by COVID. Maxed out on the vent, maxed out on pressers, CVVH. And all I could think about while I was in there was how this woman was taking up time and resources she didn't deserve. She made her choice. We're tripled in ICU and she gets a bed? I feel bad because I didn't feel bad. And this isn't how I want to feel about patients. I want to take good care of people. I want to not put my license on the line every time I clock in because I'm still liable despite my inappropriate assignment. I want to be happy (or at least not entertaining the idea of faking a fender bender on the way) about going to work again. \n\nI haven't been doing this long enough to be so jaded.\n\nEdit: thank you to everyone who is voicing support. I hate feeling this way. I absolutely love being a nurse. I love helping people help themselves. I am fortunate to have the skill set to do this job well. I'm never going to lower my standard of care because of why someone is in the hospital. It is a privilege to be allowed into someone's most vulnerable moments. It is a privilege to nurse.\n\nTo all of those who are obviously not at the bedside and think I'm a terrible person, I'm sorry I can't live up to your standard. I'm sorry I don't have limitless emotional support to give. I'm sorry I can't just turn off the feelings and do my job. I'm sorry I give a shit about doing the job well, even when I can't because of how unbelievably strained we are. I know very well that most people in the hospital are there due to diseases of affluence and have made similar choices, but none have had the devastating effects COVID continues to have on healthcare and our communities. There's an answer and it hurts that people choose not to accept it.",

It stuck with me through codes and rapids and deaths of coworkers. \n\n\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n\nYou as a healthcare worker are a force multiplier. Your training and experience is invaluable moving into this crisis. So, you’re going to be faced with some very difficult moments. You’re going to have to put your needs first.\n\nI’m speaking specifically about PPE and your safety.\n\nIf you’re an ICU nurse, or an ICU doc, and you become infected, not only are you out of the game for potentially weeks (or killed). But your replacements could be people without your expertise. Your remaining co-workers are short staffed now, more likely to make mistakes and become ill themselves. You stop being a force multiplier and start using healthcare resources.\n\nYou going in may save the patient, it may not. But you cant save any patients in the weeks you’re laying in a hospital bed or using a vent yourself.\n\nPeople are going to die. Do not become one of them.\n\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n\nDuring the Ebola outbreak, people were dying. But at no point did we rush in, we took the 10 minutes to put on our PPE with our spotter. If we didn’t have proper PPE we did NOT go in.\n\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n\nYou may work in long term care, and want to rush in to save a patient you have had for years. Do not go in without your PPE.\n\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n\nYou may have a survivor in the room, screaming at you to come in because their mother is crashing. Do not go in without your PPE.\n\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n\nYou may have an infected woman in labor. Screaming for help. Do not go in without your PPE.\n\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n\nYou may have a self-quarantined patient with a gunshot wound who is bleeding out. Do not go in there without your PPE.\n\nThere is no emergency in a pandemic.\n\nDoing nothing may be the hardest thing you’ve ever had to do in your life.\n\nMany of you say, I could never do that. I wouldn’t be able to stop myself from rushing in and saving my patient.\n\nLiberian nurses and doctors said the same thing, and many did run in to help, saying PPE be damned. My patients need me.\n\nThen they became infected, they infected others. And they died.\n\nThey didn’t help anyone after that.\n\nDo not let the deaths of hundreds of healthcare workers be forgotten.\n\nhttps://acanticleforlazarus.com/2020/03/23/there-is-no-emergency-in-a-pandemic/",

    "text": "I washed my patient’s hair yesterday So there’s a woman who’s been on our unit for a couple of months and has been at the hospital since June. The prolonged hospital stay is due to her having a recent AKA which got infected as well as many other things. Since she has been here so long she developed psoriasis in her scalp and her hair became super dr, flaky, one of the worst I have seen. No one has had bothered to give her a shower because she is a bigger woman, max assist, and it would take lots of people to help her for being such a high fall risk. Today was my first time having her. Im on a med-surg unit with a 1:5 ratio. She was complaining about her hair and I asked how long it has been since she washed it. She said maybe a month ago and she started to break down and cry. She told me it’s not no one’s fault, that we are always short staffed, there’s priority over other things than this— that she kinda gave up asking. I felt for her, and I couldn’t even imagine what my scalp would feel like if I had neglected it for SO long. So i grabbed a wash bin, some towels, and ordered shampoo and washed her hair. I’m so lucky none of my lights went off for half an hour that I was with her. Normally I don’t have time for stuff like this with my ratio and being short a nurse and tech. She literally cried tears of joy when i was done and kept thanking me. I stayed after work for a bit to catch up on some charting but it was so worth it. It was so worth it going home knowing I made such a difference for her. It’s these small little moments where I am glad I chose this profession.\n\nEDIT: Thank you guys for all the heartwarming responses, stories and awards! This is my first year of nursing and it has been pretty rough especially graduating during covid. I’m glad I did this for her and this moment will always stick with me for the rest of my career :)",

    "text": "They said she had a panic attack. I am livid. Last night while I'm getting report we hear a crash and patient starts screaming out for help. We have to push the door open because her daughter, who was visiting, collapsed in front of the door. She's having a full on tonic-clonic seizure. Face down, not defended whatsoever, all four limbs convulsing, not responding or following commands for about a minute. The patient says her daughter doesnt have a history of seizures and that she hit the wall hard when she fell (which we could hear). The visitor comes around and is completely post ictal, babbling and yelling and attempting to stand. Four minutes of us trying to keep her head an neck stable til the stretcher arrives while she screams for her mom and fights us. By the time the stretcher and security were there she's calmed down enough to be wheeled to the ED unrestrained, we calm down the patient and report what happened to rapid response and the supervisor and go about our days again. I file the safety report thinking great, she's gonna end up right back here on the neuro unit for EEG. All in all good response from my team.\n\nFour hours later who should walk right back up to our unit to say goodbye to their mother, but that visitor. To say we were stunned was an understatement. The ED was packed right now, there's no way they got her scanned and discharged her already, right? She had to have left AMA. Nope, they discharged her. Told her what she had was actually a panic attack. A *panic* *attack*. Yeah, because panic attacks make you hit the wall like a tonne of bricks and convulse for a full minute. Panic attacks have long periods of post ictal confusion after, right? *Did they at least scan your head?* No. *Did they tell you to see a neurologist?* Nope. They gave her 1mg of po ativan (for the panic attack you see) and some fluids, then let her go. Told her she was fine to drive herself home.\n\nTo say I am disgusted with my hospital was an understatement. First off, for disregarding the report of a floor's worth of *fucking neuro nurses*. For fucks sake, we do long term EEG on my unit, I'm trained in the got damned neuro stepdown unit. I *think* I know a tonic-clonic seizure when I see one. The rapid nurse even asked if it could possibly have been faked, because that *had* happened in her experience and I told her flatly no, unless she's watched hours of videos of seizures (including post ictal confusion) and is a damn good crisis actor with little regard for her own health or safety, it wasn't fake. For what? That single mg of PO ativan? In front of her sick mother who was either getting rused as well, or in on the scheme? And like, this isnt my first rodeo, I've seen a faked seizure or two in my day. But nope, what I saw was just a panic attack, nothing more.\n\nYou might think incompetence is at play, and so did we when this woman who seized before our eyes was discharged to drive herself home.  But as jaded as the hospital has made me over the years, I have to look at it more cynically. Think of it from the doctor's perspective. The ED was packed. We had to open a temporary surge unit to transfer walkie-talkies to, so that the sicker ED patients could get floor beds. And you just had one more wheeled down, right from visiting the inpatient units. She looks fine, and we just filled the last neuro bed. And look at this, how convenient, a *woman* with a history of anxiety. We can empty one of these ED beds right now if we give her some Ativan \\*for her anxiety (\\*that will ALSO conveniently keep her from seizing on her drive home) and send her on her way without so much as a scan to check for bleeding after her fall. She probably wont have another seizure til she's well beyond our care, and can deal with it then. *We're just too busy to take care of this patient.*\n\nI'm practically numb right now. I both can and cant believe that our hospital would put someone's life at so much risk, intentionally or otherwise. What if the next time she seizes she's at the top of a flight of stairs? Or behind the wheel of a vehicle? What if she hits someone, what if she crashes? They didnt care, they just wanted one less patient crowding the ED. Everyone on the floor urged her to go to her doctor. We had to be the ones to tell her what happened, as she had no memory of the event from speaking to her mother, to sitting on the stretcher being wheeled downstairs. She believed the doctors when they told her, \"You're just too anxious.\" She trusted them, maybe still trusts them and just thinks we are overly worrisome nurses.\n\nI just... don't know what to say. I witness travesties every day at my job. But it helps you suffer through when you know that everyone around you is doing everything they can to help, to make people's lives better. When you realize some people just dont care the way you do, are willing to lie to someone and put their life at risk, it makes this profession feel hollow and bitter.",

    "text": "A shit cake with fuck-this frosting Update: I spoke with my boss this morning and voiced my concerns, and she actually said she had the same ones and understood exactly where I was coming from. That's why she personally called the physician's office and demanded all documentation of their interactions with the daughter and insisted on a written order to not transport the patient to the hospital. She then personally spoke with the daughter and attempted to convince her to put her mom on end-of-life cares. Also, this daughter also apparently is personal friends with a respiratory therapist. So this poor woman is now on CPAP and is satting in the 70's. My boss instructed me to document EVERYTHING from yesterday and to get an ABN signed. That way, we also have it in writing that the daughter knows Medicare will not be billed if the face-to-face requirement is not met. What all of this means is basically that the liability for this infuriating flaming dumpster fire falls on the provider writing the orders. I'm still not happy about being involved in this spectacularly fucktastic mess, but at least OUR asses should be covered in this. Thank you everyone for your support. It gave me the courage to speak up.\n\nI'm not even quite sure how to begin this tirade, other than to say that I've waited several hours to write this in the hope that I'd calm the fuck down. However, the more I think about the absolute clusterfuck from today, the more disgusted I become with the whole absurd, and, quite frankly, unethical mess that was my patient today.\n\nI'm a home health nurse in a rural part of the country, where conspiracy theories involving COVID and vaccines abound. So, my agency gets a call from someone we all know who also works in healthcare. This is a region of small-ish towns, and the healthcare community is very small. Everyone pretty much knows everyone. So, she calls to talk to us about her mother, who has advanced dementia and is also COVID positive. She is on day 7 of her quarantine. They... they wanted us to come and give her IV fluids because she's not really eating or drinking.\n\nMy gut feeling was to say no, but it's not really my call. My boss tells me this morning that I have to go admit her for nursing, PT, and OT services. I told her I thought it was an inappropriate admission, especially when she told me this woman is so demented that she can't even be instructed to deep breathe and cough. I said if she's in that bad of shape, she should be taken to a hospital. My protests fell upon deaf ears.\n\nSo I go to this woman's house out in the middle of fucking nowhere, and she's there with her daughter (the woman we all know) and a paid caregiver. She's pale, cyanotic, and is SOB with minimal exertion. Her O2 sat was in the 60's on 6L/min via nasal cannula. I texted my boss. \"I'm not remotely comfortable with this.\" And I told her what was going on. She tells me to talk to the ordering physician.\n\nSo I call the PCP's office. I tell them I'm with the patient now, and that she's satting in the fucking 60's on 6L. They say she needs to go to the ER. Daughter pipes up and says they're not going to take her to the ER; that she's been speaking with the ordering provider on her cell phone because they're personal friends. Meanwhile, the nurse on the phone is confused as hell, because NONE of these conversations have been documented. And when I looked in her chart on our system, we had an order uploaded to her chart for A DIFFERENT FUCKING PATIENT. WE DIDN'T EVEN TECHNICALLY HAVE ORDERS TO ADMIT THIS WOMAN.\n\nBy this time, I'm fuming. I feel fucked over and set up for failure, and I want to choke the daylights out of the daughter because all this time, she's telling me that they can take better care of her at home and that if she goes to the hospital, she'll just die there. Because apparently, IV fluids are going to fucking save her. At around this time, I find out the ordering physician hasn't even fucking seen the patient before, and she's just ordering all this fucking bullshit because she's friends with the daughter.\n\nAt this point, I want to fucking scream, especially after her nitwit daughter tells me she isn't vaccinated because she wants \"natural immunity,\" all the while talking about how scary this virus is. She tells me that her family owns a local business and how \"employees are dropping like flies and some of them can't return to work because their lungs are shot.\" No shit, Sherlock Shit-For-Brains. Then she keeps talking to her mom, telling her that \"you need to get up and move so your lungs get stronger.\" Spoiler alert: she would de sat to the 40's and 50's with movement.\n\nSo I finally got what information I could get, got paperwork signed, and got right the fuck on out of there, cursing under my breath the entire time. This admission was straight, pure, full-strengh, unadulterated bullshit from start to finish. It was a freshly baked, aromatic shit cake with fuck-this frosting. It took place about 7 hours ago, and I'm still mad as hell. I wanted no part of it, but that didn't matter. I'm hoping to fall asleep soon and be less irate in the morning, but I won't hold my breath.\n\nThanks for listening.",

    "text": "Oh look, another post talking about how nurses are sociopaths Every two weeks on r/unpopularopinions there’s a post about how nurses are bullies and sociopaths and what follows is a hoard of comments from people frothing at the mouth claiming their neighbor’s girlfriend’s sister is a nurse and she’s a bitch. Here’s an unpopular opinion that’s gonna be hard for them to swallow: they’re sociopath patients and most nurses are fine. I’ve been doing this since 2017 and can honestly say I have only met one bitch nurse. \n\nThese people are like ultimate gaslighters. The doctor DC’s their narcotics and then leaves it to us to inform the patients who then scream at us and throw things because of situations out of our control. I just had a patient yesterday throw an entire bedside commode and scream at me because the doctor decreased her narco. I’ve had patients backhand me and spit on me because I’ve given them injections. I’ve had patients try and claw my eyes out and scratch my face up because I’m trying to given them their pills. One guy screamed at me and called me a bitch and threatened to kill me because I caught him smoking in his room while he was on 6L of oxygen and confiscated his cigarettes. I’ve been groped, sexually assaulted, and sexually harassed. A few weeks ago a woman called me incompetent, told me I needed my nursing licenses taken away, and accused me of trying to kill her because I crushed her pills per her doctors order and didn’t separate them for her. She literally phoned my supervisor from her room and reported me. \n\nOh and the whole neglect thing? Maybe if nursing homes had more than 3 nurses for 80-100 patients then we wouldn’t be so rushed trying to get to the next patient. Maybe advocate for better patient staff ratio with better pay and we wouldn’t miss that your grandma is a little chilly.  Literally all of us feel bad when we miss something; but missing something doesn’t make us sociopaths it makes us human. I’ve been accused of being neglectful because I didn’t call this woman at exactly 7:05 to tell her her daughters vitals for the day. \n\nAnd then we get these people going on Facebook bitching about how their “nurse just wants me to be in pain all night and she’s such a bitch” when the doctor DC’s their tramadol and then we get posts talking about nurses being bitches and the stigma of nurses being bullies continues as if there isn’t safeguards in place to make sure patients aren’t hurt, neglected, over/under medicated, harmed, or assaulted. \n\nI’m so tired of it.",

    "text": "Horrific Email from Substitute Y’all I am so embarrassed. I left work early on Friday and had a sub cover my last 2 classes. I debated posting the email for you all to see but I’m too embarrassed. She essentially emailed me to let me know that this was one of the worst experiences that she has ever had subbing and that two students are the worst students she’s ever seen in 30 years of teaching and subbing. They were disruptive, rude, argumentative, didn’t do the assignment, plus a hundred other adjectives she used to describe them. She had to threaten to have the school resource officer called, something she has never had to do. \n\nThe email is LONG. I don’t even know what to do. This is my second year and I feel horrible for how my class treated this poor woman. What should I do?\n\nEdit: I guess I should add just a little more context about the two students. This is a 9th grade science class. I have had a few issues with these students. For example, the girl skipped class and told me it’s because she was with the nurse, that was a lie. I’ve taken both of their phones, trouble keeping them focused, caught one of them cheating on a quiz. One has an F in the class and the other a D. They’re not good students.",

    "text": "A Bad Interview Got Worse So, as I posted last week, I am interviewing prospective teachers for the up coming school year. I was to help out with the interviews yesterday for a Junior High (Middle School) in our district that had its principal and vice principal both leave the school. One got a Asst. Sup. position up state and the other quit after being caught cheating on his wife with the school nurse.... on school grounds.\n\nSo I was helping out and was working with the new incoming principal and another vice principal from a different school. We were interviewing a candidate for an 8th grade ELA position (English Teacher). We had three candidates that were ok, but our last one was a piece of work.\n\nLets call her Missy. Missy looked good on paper. Master's degree in English, Bachelor's degree in Secondary Ed., 3 years experience. Worked at two schools in that time. She hadn't worked in 3 years, but I figured she took time off for her Masters. However, being very demanding wasn't listed anywhere on the resume.\n\nDuring the interview, she mentioned that she was married and had a 3 year old son. She asked if she would be allowed to bring him to school with her. This is the conversation that ensued.\n\nMe: You mean if he was sick or something?\n\nMissy: No. Everyday. he'd just sit in my room while I taught.\n\nMe: No, I don't think that would be ok. However, the district does offer free childcare for kids up to 5 for district staff.\n\nMissy: No, I don't trust strangers with my kid. I need him to be in the class with me.\n\nPrincipal: I'm sorry, but we couldn't allow that. Beside the distraction factor, it could be a liability if something happened. Could his father watch him or someone else you trust.\n\nMissy: No! He needs to stay with me. He gets upset if I am not around. He will cry. You don't want him to cry do you?\n\nOther VP: Of course not. We could always introduce you to the daycare staff and you could see if you like them.\n\nMissy: Are you stupid? I said he needs to stay with me. Besides, I'm still breastfeeding him and I doubt I can just leave to go do that.\n\nMe: Ok.... wait a minute.... I just want to make sure I have this straight for HR. You need to have your 3 year old son stay in class with you because he will cry if you are apart and you are still breastfeeding him.\n\n(FYI, I am totally cool with breastfeeding in pubic.)\n\nWell Ma'am, I don't think we can arrange that, but I will let HR know your needs if you are offered the position.\n\nMissy: I actually have a few things that I would need approved by HR. I will not work here unless all of these are agreed to in writing.\n\nPrincipal: Ok, what would those be. (He points to me) He will include them with our paperwork.\n\nMissy:\n\n1. My husband needs to be allowed to come on to campus everyday for breakfast and lunch with me.\n2. My I need to have a classroom on the first floor with a window that open so I can have fresh air.\n3. I can't stay late Wednesdays or Thursdays because I host a podcast.\n4. I need 2 Smartboards in my classroom. One in the front of the class and the other on the side wall.\n5. I won't perform additional duties like clubs or teams.\n6. I need two preps a day. One an hour before lunch and one at the end of the day.\n7. I would like a deal where if I work here for three years, the district will payoff my student loans.\n8. I need moving expenses so I can be within walking distance of the school incase my car were to breakdown. (She lived about 8 miles away.)\n9. My husband has to be allowed to be my substitute if I call out and his pay must be $300 per day. (FYI, he isn't qualified nor certified to be a substitute in the state.)\n10. I don't do parent-teacher conferences anymore.\n11. I won't teach summer school.\n12. Any student I assign detention must be supported by admin.\n13. I don't drink cheap coffee, so there needs to be good coffee in the staff lounge.\n\nMe: Ok, I think I have it all. Is there anything else?\n\nMissy: Yes,  I will need to know by Friday if I have the job and I will need one of the janitors to help me haul my stuff into my classroom and set it up. I don't want to hurt my back moving furniture.\n\nOther VP: Ok. Well thank you for your time. Its been a pleasure.\n\nMissy: You didn't ask me my salary.\n\nPrincipal: I'm sorry, you're right. What is the salary range you are looking for?\n\nMissy: Well, I am really good as you can see from my resume and I have a Master's degree. I will need at least $80,000.00 a year. (That is the upper tier level of our teacher salary range.)\n\nSo we escorted her out and wished her a good day. We then looked at her list of requirement and, while some were more than reasonable, some were just not going to happen. I took the paperwork for everyone to HR before I went home and talked to one of the HR reps who's kid  I had taught years ago. I read her the list and she just shook her head. She said she'd make sure she didn't interview anywhere else in the district because there was no chance we could meet most of those requests.\n\nJUST an FYI to those interviewing for a position, it is 100% fine to have expectations and requirements. However, those must be reasonable. No principal will hire a random person with no certifications or degree to sub, buy expensive coffee, or let your young kid hangout in your classroom everyday.\n\nBefore ANYONE bashes me, I always strive to give most candidates all the help I can and support their needs, but there are times that their requests are not something I could even argue for. Some of this woman's request, though reasonable to her, we not something the district could meet.",

The best part is that this teacher is lesbian.\nAdditionally, one of my trans students told me that our nurse referred to them as \"it\" and made them call their mom to discuss sensitive medical information on speakerphone with other students in the room.\nIt was a disheartening week.",

    "text": "Was the nurse out of line? I am student teaching in a 6th grade block (English, language arts, social studies) where we have students three periods a day. Yesterday afternoon we had one of our students sign out the bathroom pass and after being gone for about 20 minutes my teacher asked me to go see if she was okay (I Myself am a 21 year old woman). So I go to the nearest bathroom and I can hear her crying in the stall. After announcing it was me and no one else was in the bathroom she opens the stall. It is very obvious that she has peed herself. She tells me that she almost made it but just couldn’t hold it. Due to us being on the opposite side of the building I tell her to hold on a minute and go back to the classroom at which point I tell my teacher what is going on and grab my jacket. I tie it around though it is still quite obvious but hurry her to the nurses office.\n\nNow I have never had any interaction with a school nurse before so perhaps this is just what they are like. But anyways I knock on the door and she asks why we are here. I state “We are hoping you may be able to provide us some new pants.” The nurses asks why. It’s obvious the girl isn’t going to say anything so I say “student had an accident so we are going to just get changed so we can go back to class.” The nurse asks for students name, looks up chart and then goes “I purposefully transferred from elementary school here cause I didn’t want to deal with peed pants anymore.” At this point it’s super awkward and she’s goes to open cupboard stating “luckily we keep extra clothes cause girls get there first periods. But accidents should not be happening this late with no medical reason.” She hands her some sweatpants and underwear and in a condescending way mocks whether she is able to change herself. The student goes to the bathroom in her office and changes and then when she comes out with the plastic bag of her spiked clothing asks “can I come pick this up after school?” (students don’t have lockers) the nurse denies her this. So I take the bag and stare I will sneak it back into the classroom. When we leave the nurse makes a comment like “if this happens again we will have to consider a behavioral plan.” \n\nIs this normal behavior for the nurse? I get the 6th grade is probably too old to being have accidents, but to act this way seems uncalled for. I’m not sure if I should bring it up to the teacher since I don’t want to start drama. I even drafted an email to the principal. But I’m not really sure what I’m suppose to say should have been done. Thoughts?",

    "text": "PLS HELP RESTORE MY FAITH IN HUMANITY I just finished my first year as a bilingual Kindergarten teacher. I know what you're thinking... \"you signed up for hell when you chose Kindergarten\" but those sweet little psychos and their families are the only thing that kept me going this year.  \n\nThere are a lot of people involved in this so here is a key for who they are. \n\nU = other bilingual teacher \n\nP = director of human resources\n\nA = executive director of human resources\n\nG = superintendent\n\nK = principal\n\nB = vice principal \n\nJ = ESL specialist\n\nHere we go...\n\nAugust 2020 I thought I had found my dream job. I had moved back to my hometown where my parents have taught for as long as I could attend school. It was my dad's dream to one day get ready with his wife and daughter in the morning to all go to school to teach. So when he heard I got a job in the same district they teach in, he literally got tears in his eyes. (He was a computer teacher...so, he doesn't cry much. Lol) I had been collecting bilingual books since college and I wanted to teach at a Title I school where I could help where the most help was needed. So.... literally my dream job. \n\nSkip to October 2020, the kids have now been in school about a month. I was loving it..masks, desk shields, and all. October 14th was one of my students' birthdays; one day before mine. We celebrated and I had let the birthday boy pass out his cupcakes WITHOUT A MASK UGHHH. (Later, they asked people in charge of COVID stuff if my class had to quarantine and they said no bc it wasn't long enough of an interaction) Anyways... It's October 15th, 6:00am and I get an email from birthday boy's mom that he has COVID. rip. I come rushing into school asking what I'm supposed to do, contact tracing, etc. The nurse asks if we followed protocols & I responded yes except for the cupcake incident. But I told her to check with U , the other bilingual teacher, because she posted a video of the kid with two other kids sitting together without a mask on Seesaw. (We switched classes and taught each other's classes daily)  I go tell U to expect the nurse because my student has COVID and she freaks out bc she never has her mask on either. \n\nThen, I get called to a meeting with the nurse, U, and K (the principal). K tells us that two of my students will have to quarantine because U could not confirm that she asked the students to put the masks on within 15 minutes. We're sent back to class and I get an email about another meeting with K and U during my planning time. I go and K lets me know that U has concerns. Apparently, U has been feeling for a while that our students' parents are comparing us and that I am purposely trying to make her look bad. I tell her that I was just trying to give the kids as much resources as possible and didn't mean to make her look bad. She loses her shit and yells that she can't trust me and that I just want to be better than everyone. K tries to calm her down and then it's time to go pick up the kids from specials. I finish my day feeling really freaking confused and get an email about AN AFTERSCHOOL MEETING. I sit throught another meeting where U compares me to a 17 yo highschool girl (I am 22 and she was in her 50s). I am not exaggerating when I tell you that this woman stalked my SEESAW ACCOUNT to see if anyone had their masks off and was ready to show a file-folder portfolio of it and then proceeded to SCREAM that I'M a traitor. I couldn't get a word in because K proceeded to YELL AT HER to be quiet and stop talking ...no college program or professional development could have prepared me for what was happening before my eyes. Then, the lord answered my prayers and K told me that I could go so that her and U could have a private conversation. \n\nEventually, K tells me to try to be considerate about how my relationship with parents could be hurting U. Despite my own morals, I stop sending as much resources out. Meanwhile U has been at work on the other 4 Kindergarten teachers on the team. She tells them how I'm a traitor and that I think I'm better than all of them. I try to still interact with them but they start leaving me out of things and eventually have their own group chat without me. \n\nA few weeks later, I share with a colleague that I have known since I was 5 that I feel like I'm being bullied. That colleague shares it with K, the principal. The kindergarten team has to have a meeting with K because two other teachers were verbally fighting in the hallway. But, they had already beefed it out so the attention turns to me. Except I had NO IDEA we were about to talk about why I felt bullied. This was basically an opportunity for the other teachers to openly shit on me for having a \"communication problem with my teammate\" and for not \"socializing enough\". \n\nAt this point, my anxiety (which is usually controlled by medication) was off the rail and I felt completely alone. I went to see my doctor and she upped my dose and gave me additional meds which gave me KILLER side effects. I had to absent a few days. Because of the shortage of substitutes, the teachers had to split my kids up and this gave them more reason to hate me. FML. I come back and K has a meeting with me to tell me my team was upset with me because of my absences. I explained that I was having major side effects from the meds and I told her why I was anxious lately. She said she would push my eval date to later because she wasn't sure if I would be ready.  A week or so later I get a \"coin of excellence\" from  superintendent G because my students' parents are writing him emails about how happy they are. Soon enough, K calls me into her office and tells me she doesn't think she will consider me for rehire. I tell her that I would love to work on whatever it is she wants but I need specific examples of what she wants me to do. THESE WORDS WOULD COME BACK AND BITE ME IN THE ASS.  \n\nIt's now the day of the holiday party (right before our Thanksgiving/Christmas break). Our class is supposed to watch the Polar Express and I've created the cutest lesson to go with it where the kids create a book of tickets with a kind word for each of their classmates. One of the other teachers got sick and left so I had 5 of her kids come into my classroom that had no more chairs left. I get them settled and the kids continue working on the activity and watching the movie.  Then K and B (vice principal) come busting in. K tells me that B will watch my class and that I'm going to follow her. K tells me to take a look at my class and then she walks me outside of the room. She then proceeds to walk me to the other monolingual kindergarten teachers rooms and audibly says, \"THAT'S what I want you to do. That's what I want your class to look like\". The teacher was sitting at her desk on her laptop, the kids were all silent in their desks and watching the movie. She took my to the other classroom where it looked the exact same.. teacher at desk, silence, kids in chairs watching the movie. I tried to explain to her that I created an activity to go along with the movie but she told me to stop either the activity or movie immediately. We go back into my classroom where my students are literally rolling around the floor even though the vice principal was supposed to be \"watching them\". I get them to settle down and turn off the movie. K walks me around the room and points out everything that's wrong. Literally the definition of a Party Pooper. \n\nI've had enough at this point so I go to HR. My mom knew P (the director of HR) and assured me she would help. She was wrong. P listened and told me to sit down and have a talk with K after we return from the break. She also said she'd get me some district support since it sounded like I didnr have support at school. \n\nAfter break (January 2021) we have professional development before the kids come back. Things seemed fine with K and I was worried of stirring things up further. Things were NOT fine with K. She told me that J would now be in my class daily for about an hour to help me out. I thought this was for support until J ends up trying to boss me around and telling me that I'm not doing my job. That day I tell her to get out of my classroom because she is being a huge distraction to my students. If things aren't bad enough... I start getting a terrible cough. Eventually I have to leave early on a Friday because I feel really sick and completely lost my voice. Over the weekend, I have to go to urgent care and get a COVID test. The test comes out negative but the doctor is convinced it's a false negative...so, they write me a note and tell me I need to quarantine. I tell K, my team, and HR. HR then responds and tells me that my note doesn't qualify and that I will be docked after my remaining absences are used. I tell them that, in that case, I will be returning Monday. They then state that they will not allow me to return until I feel better... But, I will still be docked. That sounded like a bunch of balogna so I contacted my teacher union and she managed to get them to agree that if I can get a \"clearer note\" that I will get paid COVID leave. Please keep in mind that I'm dying of a fever and fighting off possible COVID. I call the urgent care enough to get them to pity me and they write \"due to covid symtoms\" on my note. Suddenly, those 4 magical words made my note \"qualify\". They give me the paid leave and I have about a weekend to recover until I have to go back. \n\nI get back to my classroom and someone has taken down all my students work in the hallway.     It's my first day back and K comes back \"for an observation\" and tells me how \"out of control\" my kids were while I've been gone. She tells me she'll need to meet for conference. During my conference time, she tells me how out of control my students have been while I've been gone. (Which hadn't been the case as evident by all the days that I had been texting with the substitutes) She then hits me with the, \"do you even want to teach kindergarten? Do you even want to be a teacher?\". I say, \"yes...I love teaching\". She responds, \"then you need to get better at it. It's not working out for you.\" She doesn't get enough time to shit on me because my students end up banging at my door because I was late to pick them up from specials. So, she tells me I need to meet after school. She tells me more BS and how she's not the only person that thinks I'm a terrible teacher. She says that my colleagues can never teach anything because of me, etc. \n\nI email superintendent G as soon as I leave the meeting and tell him to call me. He calls me that evening and I tell him everything. I'll give him props... He really had me thinking that he was going to \"fix\" this. He says that he wants me to continue in this district and that he would get A (executive director of HR) to give me a call and help me out. I tried to tell him that A was already biased because she was pissed about the COVID teacher union incident but he said it was fine. It was not fine. \n\nA ends up calling me eventually and tells me that she is going to tell me the exact same thing that P told me in November... To just sit down and talk to K about my feelings. I tell her I've tried but K is always aggressive and so she tells me to just try again. I email K at ungodly hours (because I'm not sleeping anyway) and tell her in the most professional way to please leave me alone so I have time to practice what she wants from me. So, she says that it's fine but proceeds to send in J to spy on me. \n\nI'm not taking that for an answer so I email superintendent G and tell him that I appreciate him sending me to A but K is now, by definition, harrasing me. He tells me to keep working with HR on the matter... But, he gets nervous so tells A to send me a discrimination and harrasment form so it can be investigation. Despite me telling him I'm uncomfortable with A doing the investigation, she is in charge of it anyway. \n\nIt is now mid February and have lost 20 pounds  (making me underweight), I have developed insomnia and the anxiety has turned into depression. Everytime the door to my classroom opens or I hear a knock, my heart races and I cry on the way to school every morning. I tell A that until she can assure me that I will not have contact with K, I am not returning to campus because I don't feel safe. She eventually agrees for B to be my \"point of contact\" instead of K while the investigation is going on. Those couple of weeks, I had to sit through meetings with B and U where U would just scream at me the entire time and B would try to calm her down.. but, they were the most peaceful I had ever had that school year because K was no longer harassing me. \n\nBut good things don't last, so A tells me that she has concluded her investigation and has found that all the adverse actions I have faced is due to my lack of success as a teacher. What did I expect? Soon, time for resignation approaches and I choose to resign for the upcoming school year. But, I'm still seeking justice bevause I cannot imagine another teacher (especially someone who doesn't have anyone experienced in their family) going through this hell. I talk to my teacher union but the dates of my membership makes them unable to help me with the situation so they refer me to the EEOC. I also get in touch with Workers Comp (who later calls me back and tells me that my principal was only trying to help and now I'm retaliating). But, EEOC tells me to continue documenting everything and to contact them again at the end of the school year. \n\nSkip to the last 3 weeks of school... K and B come down and tell me that I haven't scheduled my final appraisal so I'll have to do it now. I tell them I refuse because I've been asking for a different appraiser all year. They tell me that they will call HR and get it figured out. Later, B comes back and tells me that HR will also be at the meeting as witness and that we are meeting after school. I show up and managed to get all my ratings moved up  on the appraisal because of the evidence I present and K feels pressured since there are 2 witnesses. Then, A tells me that there are district employees that feel threatened by me so they are placing me on paid leave for the last 2 weeks. They take my keys, laptop, and that's it. I have to come pick up all my things about a week or so later and I'm not allowed to talk to anyone other than A (according to the letter the \"superintendent\" sent). I also talked to a school board member who says that what I went through was awful but there's nothing he can do. \n\nI can't get in touch with EEOC in my area but I have time for that... I still plan on bringing ally evidence to them as well. My current issue is that I just got 2 job offers and accepted one. However, when the new principal called K, she spewed all the same BS about me. So much for starting over... Like it wasn't bad enough she harassed me and ruined the year before. The principal wants to risk hiring me... But she admits that now she feels the need to have her eye on me. \n\nSo, that's why I'm here. All school year and summer I've been trying to advocate for this type of situation and show that WE DONT HAVE ROOM FOR THIS. There is already a HUGE teacher shortage... Why are you trying to get rid of the ones willing to come in and take the challenge?? And you wonder why retention rates are so high??? \n\nI am still being bullied by the district I grew up in and that my parents have served in for years and they're getting away with it. This is a shot in the dark... But I need help. What do you do when no one will listen? I have recordings of almost all of this...even when she said the infamous, \"Do you even want to be a teacher?\". And yes... I've showed this to everyone involved but they chose to ignore it. \n\nPlease help. \n\nLove,\n\nA heartbroken kindergarten teacher",

    "text": "Forced to risk my health, again :) I don't have COVID right now. However, I woke up at 1:30 in the morning with severe nausea and a low-grade fever. I put in an absence around 3, when I knew this wasn't just a weird fluke and that it would more likely than not persist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI called admin at 6:50 (we have no-contact hours from 10P-6A) and let them know that I had already put my absence in and needed to know what to do to ensure MAP testing would go smoothly with a different instructor in my room. She said \"I hope you feel better soon!\" and I immediately felt a weight lift off my shoulders.\n\n... until she called me back 30 seconds later, letting me know that I put my absence in too late (they ask we put them in before 6/6:30) and that I needed to come in to administer the test. She, apparently, was already supposed to be helping another absent teacher administer the test. This lady is not only our dean of instruction, but my appraiser as well. This is the second time she's rescinded her support for me getting better while I was sick. I had a double ear infection in both ears back in October, and after some miscommunication with an IC, she told me that, \"sometimes you have to come up to the school in the middle of the night and make sure that your plans are ready and laid out because that's just what you have to do to go above and beyond for the kids.\" Excuse me? I'm a type one diabetic with a real susceptibility, which is documented, to diabetic ketoacidosis when I become ill. I let that one slide--boomer logic, I thought, and maybe there was something real in what she said to me. Maybe I did need to come to school, break in at midnight, and hurt myself further to ensure that the lesson plans were on the desk (never mind that I have each week planned out and turned in ahead of time anyway, but ok). This morning, she said, \"let's see what you can do.\"\n\nI cried for 15 minutes. I texted a district mentor and let her know that I was feeling ill (feverish and vomiting) and she called and offered to bring me a sprite. This woman has, essentially, been a knight in shining armor for me this year so far. Although I appreciated it, I burst out into tears again. I knew there was no escaping my kids seeing my puffy eyes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI show up and the dean is not there. In fact, I don't see her anywhere walking around or helping any kids or teachers. I'm pretty sure she's just sitting in her office. In fact, I know she is, because I sent a student to grab more chromebooks and that's where they got it from--her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fever seems to have subsided (couldn't find a nurse to check my temp before kids came in; they're a whole different rant at this school that I could go on about for hours), but I'm still nauseous (and, of course, have a high blood sugar with no ketone strips on my person). I was already pretty sure I would resign at break, but now, I'm definitely resigning. No job is worth my health. No child wants me to be sick and grumpy around them (and they, in fact, chided me this morning for not staying home even though I am visibly ill). No parent (of kids I teach this year at least) wants a sick teacher around their child. However, I'm pretty sure this bout of illness is stress-related. Our principal told us last week at a staff meeting to take a mental health day if we have not yet... as if they'd approve that absence this late into the semester. I should have just told them no, but they had no right to pressure me to come in anyway. They claim MAP is important because of the TIA, but that's just as unrealistic a goal to me as getting through today without getting sick again or crying again.\n\nI would appreciate some uplifting comments. If you can, feel free to dm me pics of cats. Anything would help at this point, even a sonic drink. I am desperate to leave.",

    "text": "When the ADA Meets an Alleged HIPAA Violation I teach high school Culinary Arts at a rural Title 1 high school. I am 60 years old. This is my 31st year in the classroom and my 14th as a chef instructor. I am also autistic.\n\nI was clinically diagnosed with autism just five years ago. After learning that I was on the high performing spectrum, I had a great many ah-hah moments as I reflected upon the decisions I've made over the past six decades.\n\nAt the time of my diagnosis, I was on a large 3,500 student campus which had only been designed for about 2,500. My smallest class had 45 students. My largest class had 54. Four of my colleagues didn't even have classrooms. They had AV carts which they would wheel from one room to another depending upon which teacher in their department had that period off for planning.\n\nMost Culinary Arts classrooms consist of a class with an adjoining kitchen. In an effort to free up space, my building administration moved my class INTO my kitchen. In addition to 8 kitchen work stations, I now had 14 tables, 60 chairs, 4 file cabinets, a teacher's desk and chair, and everything that had been stored in the classroom's walk-in closet.\n\nThere were tote bins filled with cake pans, pastry bags, and piping tips. There were boxes full of decorative centerpieces and candles for when my class provided catering support. There was a stack of chafing dishes with hotel pans, a utility cart piled high with blenders and food processors, and a huge stack of muffin and cupcake pans.\n\nAll of these items had to go somewhere. I placed them on top of cabinet shelving but made sure to keep them below the one and a half foot clearance level that was required by the fire marshal.\n\nI literally piled plastic tote bins against one wall and crammed what I could into my remaining walk in closet.\n\nMy classroom/kitchen was crowded and cluttered. I was really stressed out.\n\nOnce I learned that I was autistic, I undertook some changes that were intended to reduce my overall level of stress.\n\n1. I transferred from this crowded suburban school of 3,500 students to a small rural school of just 300 students.\n2. I told my new building administration about my autism and they gave me some workplace accommodations that have really helped. I'm excused from attending pep rallies and assemblies. I am excused from chaperoning proms and overnight fieldtrips. Although there is an written expectation that all teachers attend local games, no such expectations have ever applied to me.\n3. Although I am friendly with several colleagues, I keep to myself outside of work. I don't have friends (by choice). I am not in a relationship because I don't date.\n\nMy life is very structured. I have home and I have work. At work, school law, district policy, school rules, the state instructional standards, my budget, the length of our class periods, the county health code, and the availability of tools and equipment provide the parameters within which I may function.\n\nIn order to function, I need structure. Schedules and routine impose order on a chaotic world that I don't always understand. It doesn't help that I am socially awkward. I lack the ability to understand all but the most obvious types of body language and facial expressions, I am unable to read the unspoken subtext that seems to accompany most conversations. Since I have a literal mindset, I interpret all statements literally and have a problem with understanding or even identifying when someone is being sarcastic.\n\nFor example, if someone were to say, \"I could just die for a candy bar,\" I would be confused as to why anyone would willingly give up their life for a sweet treat. People have previously sacrificed their lives in defense of hearth, home, and country. In the Bible, John 15:13 says, \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\" I am not aware of any Biblical quote (or any quote at all) about sacrificing one's life for a piece of candy. Life experience has since taught me that some statements like, \"I could just die for a candy bar\" are not meant to be taken literally. The challenge for me is that I can't always tell when someone is speaking literally or figuratively.\n\nToday I had a meeting with my assistant principal to discuss allegations of a possible HIPAA violation. I was told about this meeting yesterday. Our school nurse wanted to talk to me about an alleged violation of a student's confidential medical information.\n\nI had no idea what she was talking about.\n\nThe AP told me that when Billy (not his real name) was escorted to my class yesterday, I apparently frowned after the nurse's aide told me that this kid still had to eat breakfast. The student was already ten minutes late and with breakfast would now be fifteen to twenty minutes late. Instruction for the day's production of cheung-fun (stuffed rice noodles) had already started and I wasn't going to stop to accommodate one student since we had a great many things to do in the kitchen.\n\nPictured below is our production of this Cantonese dish.\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/MP44xZk](https://imgur.com/gallery/MP44xZk)\n\nI looked at the AP as if he was crazy. How could I have violated this student's private medical information if I hadn't said anything?\n\nI asked the AP if this meeting was going to be a disciplinary hearing.\n\n\"Absolutely not!\" replied the AP.\n\nI asked him if the nurse knew that I was autistic. I pointed out that the nurse's aide had now twice interrupted my class by bringing this student to my room so late that our kitchen production was already underway and production tasks had already been given.\n\n\"This will all be discussed tomorrow,\" explained the AP who then excused himself because he had a meeting that he was already late for.\n\nI didn't sleep well last night. I lay in bed wondering how I could have violated HIPAA if I hadn't said anything.\n\nI arrived at work this morning to find an email from the AP. The AP had asked the nurse to sit out of the meeting. He knew that I was worried and he didn't want to trigger a meltdown. The administrator told me that he'd come by to speak with me towards the end of the day. It would just be the two of us speaking and I shouldn't be worried because I wasn't in trouble.\n\nAt the end of the day, the AP came to my room. He asked me what happened when Billy came to my room. I told him. He asked me if I had said anything. I told him that I had not.\n\nHe asked me if the nurse's aide had said anything.\n\nI told him that she had told me that he had been in the health office and that he now needed to eat breakfast.\n\nHis conclusion was that I had NOT violated HIPAA. If anything, the nurse's aide had done this when she announced that the student had been in the health office. He did tell me that I ought not to have frowned.\n\nI told him that this had been an involuntary reaction. I also emphasized that I hadn't actually said anything and that my back was towards the students in the kitchen when this happened.\n\nThe AP then told me that the nurse had said that I could not punish Billy for having late to my class. He has medical issues that take precedence over instruction and I was prohibited from scolding Billy, deducting points from his grade, or doing anything in retaliation for the fact that he had a chronic medical problem.\n\nI don't know why the nurse thought that I had done anything like this. I've never even met the woman.\n\nI offered to open my gradebook then and there so the AP could see that no points had been deducted from the student's last two cooperative learning grades.\n\nThe AP told me that this wouldn't be necessary and that was that.\n\nI am not entirely sure what happened but am relieved that I wasn't in trouble.",

    "text": "AN OPEN LETTER TO EVERY STUDENT WITH WHOM I HAVE EVER SHARED A CLASSROOM: A few years ago, my brother called to tell me that he was going to marry a beautiful, intelligent, strong black woman. A woman who had served in the United States Army for over twenty years as a nurse. A woman who raised herself through various family traumas and personal defeats only to hold her head high coming out on the other side. A woman who had already faced racism and prejudice from men and the families of men in previous relationships, and yet she chose to take a chance once more on my brother, who no doubt needed to do his best convincing.\n\nAfter they wed, they had a child. One of the most stunningly handsome, intelligent, biracial, black young men the world has ever known, and the fruits of this one union opened me to deficiencies I had ignored in my own life.\n\nJames Baldwin’s essay “The Fire Next Time” had been on my reading list for some time. The catalyst for my purchase and pursuit of reading this text was the birth of my nephew and their first child together. After I finished reading that work, I put the book down. I sat in silence and ran through all of the differences between myself and my new family members. I thought of all the struggles I had seen in my life, I wondered how those struggles would translate to my nephew, and I realized then that they would be very different. I was far too old to be having this realization. It came upon me with a level of gravitas and import that should have been known to me far earlier than the age it did.  The one belief that caught me by surprise at its impact was that one day, when my nephew would be far too young to fully understand it and know the history and hatred behind it, he would hear the one word I cannot bring myself to say, or even type out. He would hear it in a song, from a friend, or even, sadly, in an attack from a stranger. He would hear it for the very first time, and he would go to his mother, and he would ask his mother the meaning behind the word, and she would need to dig deep within herself, reflecting on all her own personal experiences with hatred, racism, and prejudice, and she would be forced to look him in the eye and unpack all of it while maintaining a dignity and poise not known to me.\n\nIn that work, I came to discover what is perhaps my favorite quote: “Life is tragic simply because the earth turns and the sun inexorably rises and sets, and one day, for each of us, the sun will go down for the last, last time. Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, the only fact we have. It seems to me that one ought to rejoice in the fact of death--ought to decide, indeed, to earn one's death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life. One is responsible for life: It is the small beacon in that terrifying darkness from which we come and to which we shall return.”\n\nI always read that James Baldwin quote as one that was meant to be read stoically. The fact that we all die should offer some comfort and a resilience in the pursuits of life that are of personal import and bring us personal joy.\n\nThis is a call to action, I would say. Surely, you and I are meant not to fear death, but embrace and rejoice in it. Rest is coming, but it is not coming now because now is a time of action. I read it the same way as I did when I read Marcus Aurelius’s description of the essence of man: each according to his nature; do the things you were meant to do without avoidance. A life in fear of death is no life at all, but it is a life that we all share and we are related to each other by our natures, our ultimate reasons for being.\n\nAnd perhaps it can still be read that way. The masculine, stoic side of me would like to think so.\n\nHowever, I now fear that I have been reading it wrong. Baldwin’s is not a quote about the one way that we are unified, but it is a quote about the many ways in which we attempt to separate ourselves from one another. It is an inventory of the delineations of humanity that we embrace about ourselves and impose upon each other.\n\nToday I watched as men and women stormed the United States Capitol carrying the flag of the Confederacy. It is the flag of a failed nation, and the flag of traitors and insurrectionists. It is the flag of a people who protested for States’ Rights, but as written, they were the rights of a state to maintain an economic system that exploited and abused African men and women, stolen from their homes, and forced into slavery, the most obscene blemish left upon the Statue of Liberty.\n\nFrom the Constitution of the Confederate States, the Constitution symbolized by that flag that flew today in the United States Capitol, Article IV, Section 3, Subsection 3: In all such territory the institution of negro slavery, as it now exists in the Confederate States, shall be recognized and protected by Congress and by the Territorial government; and the inhabitants of the several Confederate States and Territories shall have the right to take to such Territory any slaves lawfully held by them in any of the States or Territories of the Confederate States.\n\nI write to you students in the hopes that you have a better solution to the divides that we impose upon ourselves through our emphasis on race, creed, religion, political affiliation, personal ethic and philosophy, sexuality, gender, and any and all other willful divisions we employ to maintain the divides between us so that we as individuals can maintain our own personal, subconscious or conscious, feelings of superiority. This is my apology to you because I did not do enough work to actively understand and address these divisions, all of these divisions, in my own time, and though I am still fairly young, my time has almost come to an end. It is yours now and it is a heavy burden, one that none older than you are envious of.\n\nI have no answer. I came to my personal conclusion too late in life. I come to you hoping that you find an answer to these divisions. And if you cannot, which is possible and likely, sadly, in your lifetimes, I come to you hoping that you are at least able to bring us closer to a solution so that the generation and generations that come after you are able to finish the work that I, that we, leave bare and unfulfilled.",

    "text": "Should I stay in the field of Media Production or change majors before I graduate? Hi, this is my first Reddit post so please bare with me. And I’m on mobile if that affects anything. \n\nSome background: I am a 21 year old Black woman. I come from a poor family and my mom and I have never had a house of our own and currently we live with my uncle. One day I realized that I love the arts so much. I REALLY want to be an actress but I know thats one of the more impossible dreams so I became very comfortable with the idea of staying in the field of media but doing almost anything else like producing, camera work, editing, basically anything that let’s me stay in the media arts while working on acting on the side. So I went to a specialized school all through high school to get a heads up on learning and volunteered and had summer Jobs all in this field to build connections with as many industry professionals as possible. \n\nSo I recently graduated from community college and just I’m proud got my diploma and was so excited that’s I wanted to show my family. I showed my uncle and he then started asking me about my future planning and my major in Uni. And I essentially told him that media is my plan B and I’m doing everything I can to make sure that I’m a hireable Jack of all trade and get a living wage. He then tells me that I need to have more contingency plans (which I do agree with). He then explain that there are so many people working to get in this field and the best I may get is an entry level position only making 30K a year which is not that livable of a wage and it may take me 10yrs to move up the totem pole. \n\n He said that as a black woman I’ll have even more against me. He also said that making as an actress would be hard for me because of my body weight. (I’m not fat but I have a good amount of pudge on me due to the pandemic) and that hundreds of girls skinner than me and are more of the beauty stand than me flock to Hollywood and don’t make it so it’ll be harder for me. As the talk went on it felt more and more hopeless. He was being realistic and it honestly crashed my whole world. I feel like the dream that I’ve had in my head since I was 14 feels so unreachable now. I’ve been thinking of the best ways to get a job in my industry and make sure that I’d be that “one in a million” person but now idk. I know he’s being real and blunt because he loves me but I feel lost and like every odd in the book is stacked against me so I guess my question is Should I even keep trying? Should I still go with Media production as a Major in Uni or should I switch to a career path that’ll probably make money out the gate even if I’m not happy with it? If anything I could do nursing or something in the medical field since that makes good money but I know I won’t like it. Is there a way to be in the media production field and make 50k+ not that far out of college? Please help me. Thank you so much.",

I work in a very specialized setting and it’s a very specialized skill set.

Like I am underpaid by 20-30K compared to managers who just manage people. We had a male program manager who managed one program with no direct reports who made 20K more than me. I manage PI for three separate service lines and all the crap I mentioned above.\n\nIn the last two years, I have amassed several certifications and certificates and have identified and mitigated numerous compliance risk issues that went undetected by the person who held my role for the decade before me.

Positions are assigned a pay grade. People generally don’t get raises without title or responsibility changes. One of my friends got a raise when some positions for another service line got moved under her; those positions have now been taken away from her and her compensation has remained the same. We have also had a few nurses put in their resignations and instead get raises.\n\nI recognize that I negotiated poorly when I accepted this role. I love my role and I love my team, but I know that if I went anywhere else in any other setting, I would make 15-20K more and that is hard to swallow when I have a husband and young kids. \n\nIs there any way to right this ship without leaving?

    "text": "What if a whole week's worth of employee paychecks you sent out should all bounce? Asking for a friend.\n\n::EDITED TO ADD:: But seriously, I am not the bookkeeper, I am an employee. My paycheck bounced. And now it turns out other employees have reported bouncing paychecks.\n\nMy general sense is I need to just quit with no notice, because it looks like this company is about to go down in flames. But there are OTHER issues here in my situation which I felt the need to ask a professional (or two, or a hundred) about.\n\nAnyone care to hear my sad tale of woe of being stiffed for over $800?\n\n::EDIT #2 on SUNDAY Jan 17, 9:30 AM Eastern Time::\n\nI'm back! I have a long long story to tell. I am going to do a copy-paste of the whole saga in the next couple of minutes right here in the OP. I hope it all fits. Stay Tuned!\n\n::EDIT #3 on SUNDAY Jan 17, 10:40 AM Eastern Time::\n\nGreetings! I am a CNA (certified nursing assistant) and I work for two different HHA agencies (home health aide agencies) here in Massachusetts. AS A LITTLE BACK STORY, I get live checks from this one agency with the bouncy-fun payroll checks, NOT direct deposit only because it's my preference (although, my OTHER employer made us all go to direct deposit this past April, we had no choice). And also, payday is ALWAYS on Fridays (not Thursdays, and instead of weekly paychecks (52 paychecks per year), we get bi-weekly checks (26 paychecks per year). Also, I operate my life on a cash-only basis. I do not have a checking account, I have a savings account instead (it is the only account I have at this time, so that fact right there will hopefully keep this story simple for you to follow, as complicated as it all is). I withdraw the cash every week, keep a super-low balance, and I live my life via the hard cash.\n\n(If you're wondering why I am a cash-only person, it's because I just don't trust banks. And be assured that because I am a CNA I am automatically NOT a criminal because I can't get state certification, nor can I legally obtain ANY job in healthcare, without yet again passing both CORI and SORI every time I apply for a new job.)\n\nMy bank is a small credit union. My employer's bank where they have the payroll accounts is one of those mega-huge investment banks which are \"too big to fail.\" Meanwhile, the bank lobbies are all closed right now due to the pandemic, so the only option when you physically go to the physical bank is the drive-thru. Any really involved banking issues need to be handled by making an appointment ahead of time to meet with someone in the lobby, and you must go through all the screening ahead of time. So as I tell my tale of multiple trips to the bank, imagine me sitting in my car at the speaker thing and the vacuum-tube-cannister thing.\n\nWhat follows is my story of the bounced payroll check saga. Maybe it's a little wordy (a lawyer could probably pare this down by 70% in length), and for that I apologize.\n\n\\---------------\n\nTimeline of events:\n\n\\----\n\nTHUR DEC 31 -- The office was scheduled to be closed on Friday, Jan 1 for the holiday, so they instead issued Thursday checks this one time during that that one week just because of the holiday. Normal payday is a always a Friday. I didn't bother going in to pick up my check that day. It was a busy day for me, and this is only one of my jobs. I have another job with another agency. so I have two sources of income. So I told myself to wait until next week (first week of January) to go and get my check.\n\n\\----\n\nTUE JAN 5 -- I went to the home office of this agency (the one with the bouncy-fun checks) to pick up my (live!) paycheck which had been sitting there since the previous Thursday. Receptionist said to me as she handed me my check: \"Examine your check before you leave. Some of the girls have reported that their checks were short.\" \\[I know it's not politically correct to say \"the girls\" but that's literally the jargon we use in healthcare when referring to the aides.\\]  The supervisor was standing there nodding her head at me. So I opened the check right there, and I discovered that instead of 28 hours for a two-week period, it was just 10 hours. The supervisor wrote down my name and the number 18 for the number of missing hours. She said they would reimburse. \\[SIDE COMMENT: My previous paycheck from 2 weeks earlier was also 10 hours. I am wondering if perhaps this error was someone in payroll --maybe a total newbie-- just did a copy-paste of my prior pay cycle without realizing the folly of that move. Another theory I have is maybe they switched over at the end of the year to a new payroll system, and they tried to carry over all the old data into the new system, and this mirroring of the previous hours was the result of the bulk data transfer. Maybe it's a combination of both of these two theories of mine (a newbie payroll clerk combined with a new payroll system). I don't know, just spit-balling here.\\]\n\nMy check was only $137.95 (should have been well over $300). \\[THIS IS THE CHECK THAT EVENTUALLY BOUNCED!\\]\n\nI left the office, drove to my bank (credit union), and (I am in the drive-thru, mind you NOT inside the bank itself) I did NOT deposit that check into the savings account. Instead I cashed it for the full value, and drove off with the cash. My bank honors all payroll checks and government checks (not personal checks), and will cash them on the spot for you.\n\nMy closing bank balance at the end of the business day (and I do not dispute this balance at all) was:\n\n$68.36\n\nAnd again, I will remind you, this is a savings account, not a checking account, and it's the only account I own right now.\n\n\\----\n\nFRI JAN 8 -- Unbeknownst to me, a special run of new payroll checks got issued on this day for all of us girls whose paychecks of the week before had gotten shorted. This employer does paycheck cycles of 2 weeks (26 paychecks a year) so this was an off-Friday for paychecks. I just didn't know they would print these checks. So I didn't pick it up. It just sat there at the receptionist's desk in the main office for another full week.\n\nMeanwhile my OTHER job, on this same Friday, did a direct deposit of $126.38 in my credit union savings account. I didn't go and withdraw that money from the direct deposit because I was busy that day and didn't need it. I let it sit in the account over the weekend.\n\nMy closing bank balance at the end of the business day (and I do not dispute this balance at all) was:\n\n$194.74.\n\n\\----\n\nMON JAN 11 -- I drove to the post office so I could retrieve the latest mail from my PO Box. And in there I found a late Christmas card from my favorite Auntie with a personal check in it for $50 (she lives 2 counties away from me, so not only is it a personal check, but a way-the-heck-out-of-town check as well). I also found my COVID stimulus check for $600. I drove to the bank (my credit union) and when I got my vehicle up to the speaker-vacuum-tube-cannister thingy of the drive-thru, I did the following transactions:\n\na) withdrew $180.00 cash from that day's balance of $194.74\n\nb) deposited my Auntie's personal check for $50 (couldn't cash it outright because it is a personal check, it HAD to be deposited)\n\nc) cashed the full $600 stimulus check for full value\n\nI pocketed the entire $780 in cash, and went about my business that day. I knew my Auntie's check would be held for another 3 or 4 days, so I just let that go for the time being.\n\nMy closing bank balance at the end of the business day (and I do not dispute this balance at all) was:\n\n$64.74.\n\nAnd the $50 Christmas check was being held by the bank for a few days, so my \"Available Balance\" was listed as being only:\n\n$14.74\n\n\\----\n\nTUE JAN 12\n\nWhile I was busy with life, my bank (a credit union) got the message from my employer's bank (a really huge investment bank) that the payroll check for $137.95 which I had cashed at my bank exactly one week earlier on Tuesday, January 5, was rejected for insufficient funds in my employer's payroll account over at the mega-huge investment bank. All this happened without my knowing about it.\n\nSo on this day, January 12, after my bank/credit union received the bad payroll check back from the mega-huge investment bank, my bank/credit union turned around and raided my bank account to recoup their losses. They also charged my account $7.81 (really strange number!) for a bounced check fee. (I reviewed my account ToS and the standard charge for a bounced check is $7.81. Maybe it's an old bookkeeper's trick to be able to scan down a very lengthy ledger of numbers and find that one odd-ball number in the mix. Idunno, I'm just spit-balling.)\n\nThis generated a letter from the bank to me, letting me know I had a bounced check fee. The letter went to my PO Box, but I still didn't know any of this yet. (I only go to my PO Box every now and again, not every day.)\n\nMeanwhile, by the close of business that day, my account was now registering a negative balance of:\n\n\\- $81.02.\n\n(I also don't go online and check my bank balance every either. Believe me! If I had seen a negative balance in my account at any time, I would have been all over it!)\n\n\\----\n\nFRI JAN 15\n\nA direct deposit from my OTHER employer (the one whose payroll department has their act together) hit my account. It was for $67.79. This reduced the negative balance of my account down to just:\n\n\\- $13.23\n\nand I still knew nothing about this (yet).\n\n(SPECIAL SIDE NOTE -- there is a minimum balance requirement at my credit union of $5.00. So there were actually 2 different versions of the negative balance: the -$13.23, and then an adjusted negative balance of -$18.23, which of course is a difference of exactly $5.00.)\n\nThis same day, I drove to my employer around 3:30 PM to pick up my latest paycheck. They handed me TWO payroll checks. These were, 1) the special reimbursement check from last week which I never knew existed, and then 2) the normal Friday paycheck for the latest 2-week payroll cycle. The special payroll check was $248.32. And my regular payroll check was $415.08. Grand total of $663.40. (MINOR SIDE NOTE: I didn't notice at the time, but this was actually way too much money because I deliberately specify a very high tax withholding on my checks. Someone, somewhere in the payroll department of my bouncy-fun-paycheck employer reset the withholding to a lower amount, and I don't know why. But I can certainly fix that in the upcoming weeks. And so, because of this reset of my withholding, I am AGAIN suspecting that this is possibly a case of a new payroll software being used by my employer.)\n\nI then drove to my bank to cash these two payroll checks. I arrived around 4 PM. As I sat in my car, in the automobile line for the drive-thru, waiting my turn to get my car up to the speaker-vacuum-tube-cannister thingy for the drive thru, I took out my cell phone to glance at my bank account balance, and figure out how much I needed to withdraw after the latest direct deposit from my other employer.\n\nMy phone's screen told me that my account balance was in the negative by just under $20, or\n\n\\- $18.23.\n\nI didn't panic, I was merely puzzled. So I got up to the speaker and the vacuum tube thingy, and I politely asked the teller what was up with my account balance being in the negative.\n\nShe got a look and said: \"You deposited a check that bounced. It was for $137.95.\"\n\nI realized it was my payroll check from 2 weeks earlier that she was referring to. And after another few moments of polite discussion about it, she said \"My manager just told me we can't cash these other two payroll checks that you just now presented to us from that same employer. So we're going to send them back to you \\[via the vacuum tube thingy\\] right now.\" She apologized, I said it was okay. She suggested I try driving to the mega-big investment bank to see if they would honor the two payroll checks for $663.40.\n\nI thanked them for their explanation. Then I drove a few hundred yards away to park, and I called one of my best friends in the world, a wonderful woman I've known for over 20 years, and whose wedding I was in. She's a human resources officer in New York, so she is very well versed in employee payroll disputes and all the legal ramifications as well as the options for what employees can do when their payroll is messed up. (It's so awesome to have friends who work in these kind of specialty fields, and knowing you can call them and ask for advice and guidance. John and Paul were right: \"I get by with a little help from my friends.\")\n\nShe said go back to my employer right now (it was already 4:15 at that point, and the office was closing at 5 PM) and tell them what was going on. She said I should ask them if they would make good on this money by tomorrow (by Saturday, January 16). And if they hesitated in any way to make me whole again by Monday, then I should go to the Department of Labor. I asked her if I should go to the mega-huge investment bank to try and cash these other two checks that got rejected by my credit union just now. She said if I had time, yes. But in her opinion, going to my employer over the bounced check was the priority at this moment. The bounce itself was a legality that carried more weight than the rejection of the other two checks in this particular instance (a distinction with a difference). If I could financially afford to hold off on those other two checks, go to the employer immediately, worry about the other two checks later.\n\nI went back to my employer. I got there by 4:30. I spoke to the receptionist. She said: \"Wow, a lot of other girls here said their paychecks have been bouncing lately!\"\n\nI smiled and secretly thought to myself (Oh my dear God!)\n\n\"Can I talk to someone in payroll?\" I asked (very politely, not a molecule of anger or sarcasm or emotionalism).\n\nThe receptionist called human resources (which is in Connecticut for some reason!) and then after she explained all of this to the HR rep, she handed me the phone. I chatted with HR for about 10 minutes (I kept it very polite, no anger, no snark). HR said they found out several days earlier about the bounced check (their bank called THEM!), but then they were told by their mega-huge investment bank that my check (and I presume other such bounced checks) were eventually cleared. I said no, my bank said it wasn't cleared.\n\nSo then I asked \"How can I get my money for this check? My bank account currently has zero dollars in it. And the bank also refused to accept these other two payroll checks that I only just now picked up today. So I literally have no money.\"\n\nShe said: \"Maybe we can resolve this on Monday. And maybe we can do a direct deposit for you instead of a check. So I will call you back on Monday. Okay?\"\n\n\"When on Monday?\" I asked.\n\n\"In the morning,\" she said.\n\n\"When in the morning?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'll mark my calendar right now,\" she said \"I will call you back at 11:30 on Monday morning.\"\n\n\"I look forward to your call,\" I said. \"Have a good weekend.\"\n\nWe each hung up. I called my friend back. She said \"I forgot to mention: Monday is MLK day. They might not be open.\"\n\n(Awww! Man!)\n\n(And I totally do not like the idea of a direct deposit because of how much I hate direct deposit.)\n\n\\----\n\nSAT JAN 16\n\nSo .... first thing in the morning, I got up super early, gathered as many documents as possible, reviewed them, tried to piece together a timeline, and then I cam here to this message forum and posted this post.\n\nThen I made the following trips (I had to be early because ALL of these destinations were going to close by noon time because that's how Saturdays go. And so I had to squeeze everything into a 3-hour window of time). My mission was to go to three separate banks plus my PO Box. All in one outing. FOUR destinations on a rainy Saturday morning.\n\nFIRST I drove to my credit union, got in line at the drive-thru, and when I got to the speaker, I said, \"I need to make my account whole for now.\" So I deposited $24.00 in cash. This raised up my negative balance from the -$18.23 to a positive number of $10.77 (and $5.00 is the minimum balance, so I really only have access to an \"Available Balance\" of $5.77).\n\nHowever, this deposit (because I waited until Saturday to do it, rather than doing it in the drive-thru yesterday, which I would've if I'd been thinking) won't kick in until Tuesday, January 19, the first business day after the MLK holiday on Monday, January 18. So technically, my account is still in the red.\n\nI also asked them if I could have a printout with formal ledger items on it itemizing the details of each transaction. . They said I should have a letter sitting in my PO Box with the bounced check notice. I said I needed an explanation in writing detailing the $137.95, because that check is nowhere to be found in my account history due to the fact that the check never actually hit my account. I merely cashed it at the window. They accommodated me with printouts of several screen shots of THEIR database which only THEY get to see (very helpful!) showing me the dates and the check number for the bad check, and the dollar amounts of the check and the fee.\n\nSECOND, I drove to ANOTHER credit union about 6 blocks away. I got my car up to the speaker of the drive-thru and asked if I could open an account. The reason I wanted to do this is because if my employer --the one with the bouncy-fun payroll checks-- is going to continue to present difficulties for me with the cashing of paychecks, I want a separate bank account for now, so that my OTHER payroll deposits from my OTHER employer don't get confiscated anymore. This other credit union politely said that the opening of an account on a Saturday during the pandemic is not possible. They said all regular transactions are currently being done only via the internet and the drive-thru, and that the opening of a new account, as well as all other specialty banking services, requires an in-the-lobby meeting with a bank specialist by appointment only, and their bank specialists are not available at all on Saturdays. They said I should come back on the next business day, which will be Tuesday (since Monday is MLK Day, and they will not be open at all). So I made an appointment with them for an in-the-lobby meeting as I was talking with them at the speaker. I will be there first thing Tuesday morning.\n\nTHIRD, I drove to my PO Box. I retrieved from it the letter from my credit union which was auto-generated back on Tuesday, January 12, stating that my account had been subjected to a Return Check Fee of $7.81. They itemized the check (the bad payroll check) and the dollar amount it was for, as well as the check number (a 6-digit number from my employer's business/payroll account). The letter also declared that my account was now in a negative balance.\n\nFOURTH and LAST, I drove to the mega-huge investment bank where my employer has their payroll account. I presented the two payroll checks totaling $663.40, which my credit union said they were not allowed to honor this past Friday. The tellers at the mega-huge bank didn't bat an eye. They cashed them both! Hooray! I now have cash!\n\nThe only drawback here is that they had to charge me two $6.00 fees since I do not have an account with them. So I am now out $12.00 more. (I am going to request that my employer reimburse me that $12.00 in addition to the $7.81.) So instead of $663.40, they gave me $651.40. (I failed to get documentation of this $12 fee. I will need to negotiate this with my employer when they undertake reimbursing me.)\n\nSorry for the long drawn out story. I can come back and keep you all posted on the upcoming developments.\n\n\\-- IB\n\n::EDIT #4 SUNDAY Jan 17, 10:45 AM Eastern Time::\n\nI forgot one detail: it seems that my credit union has placed a 14-day hold on my payroll check --or else it has placed a 14-day hold on the funds for my payroll check. I have come to understand that the bounced payroll check was indeed honored, but my credit union is choosing to withhold the funds from me. (I am a cash-only person, so I'm not an ideal customer. I can only presume that they would treat me better if I maintained a high balance at all times.) Those funds will not be released into my account until January 26, which is exactly 14 calendar days after the January 12 date when they charged me the Returned Check Fee.\n\n&#x200B;",

How do you think colorism/texturism/featurism has impacted the way lighter and darker skinned black women have been portrayed in the media?\n\nOn the bachelor contestants, Taylor Nolan's recent Instagram live, her and Pieper touched on colorism and the mixed race experience. Pieper talked about how being a lighter skinned black woman, racism affects her differently. She talked about how there are nuanced and different levels of racism.\n\nTaylor says she and other light black women (like Pieper) have been portrayed as angry black women. She also talks about how her and other light skinned black people were light enough to get onto the show and be the token black person.\n\nIn my own experience, as a mixed black woman, I think colorism can sometimes allow me to get my foot in the door in white spaces like jobs but I am still watched suspiciously because they assume I will do black stereotypes because of racism (like steal, get angry, be late, be uncivilized and abuse/attack). I remember growing up in the white conservative suburbs and feeling ignored and not considered for dating by white and poc/black boys because I was not white and having a lot of trauma from that. I remember a racist white nurse dismissing my pain and assuming I went in her office to skip class. I remember some white teachers treating me poorly, assuming I had an attitude and not giving me the benefit of the doubt. As a woman, I avoid being in all white spaces... But when I have been, now I have to worry about being hyper sexualized by white men. In liberal white spaces, I worry about being fetishized. When I call a white person out for racism, ask for my needs, am quiet or angry, I am seen as a threat and Intimidating by white people because I am challenging the status quo and not appeasing them. So I definitely have experienced the angry black woman stereotype projected onto me. I also know being a lighter mixed black women other stereotypes may be projected at me such as being seductive, sexual, soft, attractive, intelligent, etc. But that isn't always the case. Sometimes I'm thrown the black stereotypes and other times the mixed race stereotypes, often both.. that's why the experiences overlap for me and I call myself a black mixed woman.\n\n\nHow do you think colorism/texturism/featurism has impacted the way lighter and darker skinned black women have been portrayed in the white media/shows? Do you see any differences in portrayal? Do you think mixed/lighter skinned black women are often portrayed as angry?",

    "text": "The real reason I got sober. (TW: alcoholism, police brutality, racism, sexual assault) TLDR: Police brutality and racism is the real reason I decided to get and stay sober.\n\nLike most people my 2020 was absolute garbage, my quarantine started in January of 2020 after my landlords negligence in keeping the sidewalks shoveled caused me to break my leg while walking. Being in the service industry, I was unable to work for the entire month of February and during that time I would say that my alcoholism went from ‘moderate’ to ‘functioning’. I was stressed because I’m an active person that had to stop and sit overnight. I was drinking pretty heavily during that time because I was bored and depressed being out of work and watching the news about Covid and learning about the details of Ahmaud Arbery’s murder.\n\nBy the time I was back to work in March, Covid had really ramped up in the US and I worked for less than two weeks before the state of Minnesota shut down for quarantine. I did not handle it well, especially since quarantine started the same day that Breonna Taylor was murdered (we have the same first name including pronunciation), I had the news on in the background when her murder was announced and it really disturbed me to hear her name and all of the details of her murder. Like so many other Black people I’ve always had that fear of being murdered by the police for no reason, but to hear her name was my name was a feeling I never hope to experience ever again. Ahmad Arbery’s murder details were still emerging as well. I was also alone all the time as my husband was able to continue working and I was pretty much self-medicating in the only way I knew how.\n\nOn May 21, 2020 I was able to sober up just long enough to go to the store, on my way home a comedian on the comedy channel I was listening to was making rape jokes. As a survivor of rape I immediately flew into a PTSD rage, I’d been having suicidal thoughts for awhile, but that was the last straw. I started speeding, all I wanted to do was crash into at tree. I’m unsure what happened next, but my brain shut off and my body took over and the next thing I know I was parked outside of my home shaking uncontrollably, crying hysterically. I went into the house and confessed to my husband what I had tried to do, he immediately called my parents to come over. My Dad took me to the hospital, but because of Covid, he was told to leave as soon as we got to the hospital. I was alone and scared in a waiting room telling an intake nurse about the past two years of my life and what led up to me being suicidal, that would be the first of six times that I would have to tell that traumatic story in the next day and a half. I was then escorted by two armed policemen to my “room” where I had to take off my clothes, surrender all my belongings, and wear dark red scrubs. A doctor eventually came hours later and promised that I could go upstairs to receive help as soon as my Covid test came back negative. That was a lie. I spent all of Thursday night and all of Friday stuck in that room. The only silver lining was a good friend of mine was a nurse in the mental health ward and provided comfort for me and relayed information to my husband about what was going on. Friday night I told the staff that I wanted to be discharged. Instead, they finally sent me to the upstairs area (escorted by an armed police officer) at ten o’clock at night. I was finally able to take a shower and could relax a little and read a book, but not before I had to retell my trauma story again. On Saturday I demanded that I be discharged and was finally allowed to go home, only after my friend advocated for me to a sympathetic doctor who understood my frustration.\n\nMy husband picked me up and we ended up taking Chicago Ave. home, as we drove past Cup Foods I remember making a silly remark about how my brother used to shop there when he lived around the corner. I was drinking heavily again by Sunday night, and by Monday evening George Floyd had been brutally murdered.\n\nFrom then on my alcoholism went from ‘functioning’ to ‘non-functioning. I couldn’t deal with anything at all, I felt guilt at being suicidal, I was angry that another Black person had been murdered by police, I was furious that out-of-town white nationalist were burning down my city while Black residents were being blamed. In the weeks that followed I remember reading all the terrible things people were saying to try and justify not only George Floyd’s murder, but Breonna Taylor’s, Ahmaud Arbery’s, Philando Castile’s, Tamir Rice’s, Botham Jean’s, Atatiana Jefferson’s, Mike Brown’s, Sandra Bland’s and every other poor defenseless soul that was unfairly taken too soon.\n\nOn June 6th, I served my first shift since March. I was deeply traumatized by it. Driving to work I had to see all the damage the the white nationalist had done to my city, one of my friends had her salon destroyed, another had his clothing store burned. The restaurant I worked at had a window broken out, everything along Lyndale Ave. was boarded up. As soon as I clocked in I bought a double shot of whiskey and downed it. I’ll never forget how insufferable and oblivious my tables were, if I hadn’t been tipsy I would have gone off. Table after table of yt people without a care whining about having to wear a mask and social distance as though there was no global pandemic or complaining that there was a curfew in place as though there was no social justice movement happening. At one point, it started to rain, my table was under their patio umbrella while I was standing next to them getting rained on as they debated for several minutes about what to order. I completely broke inside, I felt unseen, unheard and less than nothing. By the time I got off work I was starting to get the DT’s, so I rushed home started taking shots and cried in the shower until the water turned cold. I took a leave of absence from work to focus on my mental health, which really meant drinking too much and arguing with racist strangers online.\n\nOn June 18th I was standing over the kitchen sink at 7:45 am after my husband left for work, vomiting and shaking from the DT’s while in my bathrobe drinking shots of vodka so I could try to sleep. In that moment all I could think is how if anything ever happened to me at the hands of the racist police of this city or any city, all the racist “thin blue line” losers would just use my alcoholism as an excuse for why I deserved to be murdered and blame me as they have so many other unfortunate Black souls. I called my husband, parents, and brother and told them that I needed to meet with all of them together. That night, I confessed that I was an alcoholic (to no one’s surprise) and I needed help. The next day my wonderful therapist helped me find a rehab center, it was the Betty Ford Clinic in Palm Springs, CA. I was there for three weeks in July and I’ve been sober ever since. I went back to work at the end of August, but only as a host and food runner. \n\nDaunte Wright was murdered this past Sunday across town, as usual the racists are trying to justify his murder because of things that are completely irrelevant, also because they are trashy barely human beings. I hate that I’ll never relapse because racist cops will always be out there committing crimes while lying about it. I’ve also learned that relapsing and the forgiveness that comes with from society is definitely a privilege reserved for yt people.\n\nAs much as I love the city of Minneapolis, I’m not going to miss the racist police force or liberal white racism. My husband and I are trading it in for the liberal white racism of Austin, TX (at least the winters are shorter). I’m also no longer in the service industry and now work and thrive happily in a bakery.\n\nThank you if you made it this far, and I mean not only reading this story, but staying strong as a Black woman wherever you are in the world. You all mean the world to me and I thank you everyday for this subreddit. You brought me back to life.",

I’m also pro-choice and needed someone to talk to about BC options for me. Had a bad experience with white male docs last summer and I wasn’t trying to subject myself to that again.\n\nI don’t want to get too deep into it, but basically I live in a very predominantly white + Asian area (bay area CA) and needed to see an obgyn. I searched all over the internet to find this woman, and I guessed judged a book by its cover.\n\nWent in last week and the first thing I saw in the office were mommy magazines and tiny figurines of what I assume was the birth of baby Jesus on the front desk. I should’ve known from that point that I didn’t need to be there. 😅 When she saw me it was like the nice act immediately dropped once it was clear I wasn’t looking to have a baby anytime soon. She was very cold and matter of fact with me, and wasn’t very welcoming or understanding. Didn’t show any compassion when I told her my story. I even tried to hint at how hard it is to find the right doctor as a black woman and she didn’t really pick up on that. She did my Pap smear (didn’t warn me about the discomfort either) and then had her nurse tell me days later I had BV and needed to pick up a prescription that has since been giving me terrible nausea. \n\nNow I know not all black women are the same, and that maybe I shouldn’t have expected a grandmotherly experience just because we share skin color. But I just feel like given the context of this past year alone, the statistics around black women and reproductive health, and the fact that she’s the only black female obgyn in the area.... like am I wrong to have wanted a little more warmth from her?? I’m very disappointed and honestly have had better experiences at my local underfunded planned parenthood 🥴",

Im feeing a tad bit annoyed, and find that there is a disturbing theme throughout the show. The black women (Nurse April, Nurse Maggie, Dr. Robin Charles, and Sharon Goodwin) all struggle with their relationships. Like extreme struggles. One man had a juvenile record and false identity. Another husband left the wife and got with someone new, an engagement fell through, and with the successful doctor she ends up having a tumor and she suffers mentally so she decides to leave her relationship. This trend is disturbing to me. Of course we’ve seen this in other shows and movies. The black woman is always alone and has been done wrong. No happiness for the black women in these shows. It portrays a very negative image of black women, that we are somehow incapable of finding healthy love. This makes it difficult sometimes to enjoy a show. I’m just super aware of things like this. \n\nI just wanted to vent. I don’t have many black females in my life to have these discussions with.",

    "text": "Medical question Hi ladies -\n\nI’m in between OB/GYNs right now, because I moved to a new city right before the pandemic, and my old OB/GYN was no longer covered by my insurance, so I’ve just been riding it out until I can find a provider that is right for me.\n\nI’m asking this question here because I feel like there is some cultural competence needed, and I want to hear the opinions/experiences of other black women (because, doctors are to black women what cops are to black men, so they say).\n\nBasically, I’ve been on a combo birth control for like 15 years. Started when I was young due to extremely heavy bleeding and all the women in my family having female cancers. The pill was supposed to reduce my risk of female cancers and deal with the heavy periods. It’s been working fine all this time.\n\nUntil about a month ago when everything just went haywire and I’m spotting like crazy. So, I reach out to Planned Parenthood to see if perhaps I need to restart my pill or try a similar one, and the nurse tells me that I need to stop my birth control pills immediately, because combo pills are dangerous for people w/ migraines with auras because it increases risk for stroke. She was like YOU HAVE TO STOP.\n\nI appreciate her, but I’ve been on the pill for over 15 years, and I assume that this decision was made, and was continued to be made because of weighing the risks and because my period can’t be controlled without it.  Also, no one has ever told me this before!\n\nSo now I’m like, so I change up a pill that my entire medical team is aware that I’m on because this woman said so? Or do I seek more information? I did some research just now, and it looks like the risk of stroke can be higher, but it’s unclear how much higher it is versus just being on birth control, which carries a risk of stroke.\n\nAny ladies ever experienced this before? How do you weigh your medical advice, knowing that we gotta look out for ourselves?",

See below for all the studies. What do you expect when feminsim teaches extreme misnadry, male privelge theory etc.... that feminise teachers will be like this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrevious submission got deleted by mod eventually so reposting here... still check it out as many excellent comments from men and women about their experience of this bias... many pointed out very obvious misandric comments from their teachers, some teachers even commented about their biases:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers\\_mark\\_girls\\_higher\\_for\\_identical\\_work\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers_mark_girls_higher_for_identical_work_to/)\n\nThis is an unpopular fact as it widely held in society that women and girls are discriminated against in education and in work, indeed in everything in life.\n\nNote; below is general statement, countless awesome teachers but....\n\n**Education is an example of institutional sexism. Now this data should to even feminist not be surprising... after all they call male majority and even female majority places as rife with sexism and \"male norms\" i.e. women have to act like men... is it any surprise then in teaching where 98% of early educators are female, 90% primary school teachers are female and these teachers have often studied gender studies type radical subjects at uni, and all HR and admin is female, that there is \"female norms\" being applied in education..... that the default child is a girl according to teachers? As the following data shows e.g. female teachers punishing boys for entirely normal behaviour that they dont understand; marking girls higher for IDENTICAL work, and giving higher predicted grades (despite boys objectively getting higher real life assesments) as they prefer girl students as model students and can relate to girl students better.... it is no wonder that schools are reducing play times, even removing physical education completely and replacing it with in class movement.... i.e. an entirely anti boy environment.... if 40% of boys are being drugged with aderal in some schools, do you think 40% of boys are unwell or maybe its the teachers who are shit and the system they made?**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOver then entire OECD countries globally, a large scale study showed that girls were given higher marks for IDENTICAL work to boys. OECD also showed that a boy receives 1/3 higher grade if the teacher does not know he is a boy. Interestingly this gender gap goes away when it is a male teacher doing the marking.\n\n[https://www.tes.com/news/teacher-stereotyping-means-higher-marks-girls-says-oecd](https://www.tes.com/news/teacher-stereotyping-means-higher-marks-girls-says-oecd)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/eliminating-feminist-teacher-bias-erases-boys-falling-grades-study-finds](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/eliminating-feminist-teacher-bias-erases-boys-falling-grades-study-finds)\n\nCornwell found that boys in all racial categories are not being *“commensurately graded by their teachers”* in any subject *“as their test scores would predict.”*\n\nThe answer lies in the way teachers, who are statistically mostly women, evaluate students without reference to objective test scores. Boys are regularly graded well below their actual academic performance.\n\nBoys are falling significantly behind in grades, *“despite performing as least as well as girls on math tests, and significantly better on science tests.”*\n\nAfter fifth grade, he found, student assessment becomes a matter of *“a teacher’s subjective assessment of the student’s performance”*, and is further removed from the guidance of objective test results. Teachers, he says, tend to assess students on non-cognitive, *“socio-emotional skills.”*This has had a significant impact on boys’ later achievement because, while objective test scores are important, it is teacher-assigned grades that determine a child’s future with class placement, high school graduation and college admissibility.\n\nEliminating the factor of *“non-cognitive skills…almost eliminates the estimated gender gap in reading grades”*, Cornwell found. He said he found it *“surprising”* that although boys out-perform girls on math and science test scores, girls out-perform boys on teacher-assigned grades.\n\nThe report also found that:\n\n* At primary level 85% of teachers are female. This has remained roughly the same since 2003.\n* At secondary level the percentage of male teachers has fallen steadily at first and later precipitously from 40% in 2003 to 31.7% in 2012.\n\n**It has been shown that boys and girls do better in reading when they have a same sex teacher. Just one year with a male teacher reduced the reading gap by 1/3 for 13 year old boys.

[https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/yq24b](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/yq24b)\n\nIn another study in the work place researchers asked supervisors to grade two poorly written essays and to provide feedback directly to each writer over chat, so that the writer could improve. At this point, the writers' names (Andrew or Sarah) were revealed, revealing that one was a man, the other a woman. Participants submitted a grade to each writer, as well as substantive comments to improve their essays.\n\nParticipants were more likely to tell white lies to the woman writer,  **inflating Sarah's grades nearly a full letter grade higher than from their initial private evaluation. They also gave her more positive comments than they gave Andrew. In contrast, the man's in-person feedback was statistically indistinguishable from the participants' undisclosed evaluations of his work.**\n\n**Please note:** When this study was reported, it was reported as being discrimination towards women as their performance was being upgraded and they weret being given correct feedback, rather than the more obvious statement, that men are being disrimnated against and women work is being marked up.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBoys 'being held back by women teachers' as gender stereotypes are reinforced in the classroom\n\n[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1307856/Boys-held-women-teachers-gender-stereotypes-reinforced-classroom.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1307856/Boys-held-women-teachers-gender-stereotypes-reinforced-classroom.html)\n\nChristian Hoff Sommers explains how boys are being punished for normal behaviours:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFpYj0E-yb4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFpYj0E-yb4)\n\nDo Schools discrimiante against boys: Dr. Jim Dueck, author, former Assistant Deputy Minister of Education for the province of Alberta, and former head of Accountability and Student Assessment, performed a revealing analysis on current practices in student assessment. The results were not only remarkable but very disturbing, exposing what might well be an institutional suppression of the performance of male students.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qloY4OJxBoQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qloY4OJxBoQ)\n\nRelated, despite a widely held view to the contrary, in a large scale national study, women are favoured 2:1 over IDENTICAL or even slightly more qualified men in STEM applicationss but gender BLIND helps men significantly, and the latter is now becoming less commonly applied as a result.\n\n[https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360)\n\nThis could go to explain why many prominent claims of discrimination have failed as there is a perceived bias but on investigation, this is proved false e.g. US womens football team equal pay claim led to the judge saying the women were paid more than men, or women suing Google only for Googles results to show they were paying mens less.\n\nFunding:\n\nFemales given $6 billion per year more in grants by government for education despite being the overwhelming majoirty in university\n\n[https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=13620&fbclid=IwAR1zxexkrfKy5VeGcW0IC-hUy6mgUMQS4F8di\\_Eyk3ZDt2jhMVgtTcX6WcA](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=13620&fbclid=IwAR1zxexkrfKy5VeGcW0IC-hUy6mgUMQS4F8di_Eyk3ZDt2jhMVgtTcX6WcA)\n\nThere are also 11 female only scholarships per 1 male one, with some universities have 100 female only scholarships and none for men, again despite men being a minority in university, and in alsmost all courses (even in STEM technically men are a minority, its only a few specfic subjects e.g. physics, computer science that men are a majority while women are a majority in Medicine, Biology, Nursing, Psychology, Veteniary Medicine etc)\n\n**At home (similar ins school):**\n\nBoys are more likely to receive corporal punishment from their parents then girls ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952896/)). They are also, in general, more likely to recieve severe verbal and physical punishment from both mothers and fathers ([source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227312033_Harsh_Discipline_and_Child_Problem_Behaviors_The_Roles_of_Positive_Parenting_and_Gender/link/55aeac6b08aed9b7dcdda4c0/download)). Some studies indicate the difference is less pronounced at the home and may be non-significant in the first years of infancy ([source](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/113/Supplement_5/1952.full.pdf)), but the difference is still present in the same direction as it is in schools for most of adolescence.\n\n**Can something be done? Of course:**\n\n[http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/sept06/vol64/num01/Teaching-to-the-Minds-of-Boys.aspx](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/sept06/vol64/num01/Teaching-to-the-Minds-of-Boys.aspx)\n\nThis school took a boy friendly approach. What was applied is explaied in detail. **Boys performance rocketed, gender gap went and girls performance went up nearly as much too.**Current system is bad for everyone but it just s happens it massively favours girls. I think it will get worse bad sterotypes about boys and now literally every other story about manspreading, mansplaining, toxic masculinty, menaretrash (real hashtag on twitter) all will not help. There is no political will... in the UK the head of uni admissions even said she thinks its a scandal no one is doing anything about plumetting uni levels for boys and if any other group it would be an outrage.... Uni of Arizona has 160 female only scholarships and 2 male ones despite women outnumbering men in almost every single degree... in the very few that they dont in STEM (not even all stem, for example more female medics, biology, vets) they are actively recruiting girls but doing nothing for boys\n\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/05/real-reasons-girls-outperforming-boys-school/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/05/real-reasons-girls-outperforming-boys-school/)\n\nTelegraph article on number of men in teaching, and techers openly admitting to sexism in favour of girls:\n\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11668169/Why-arent-we-doing-more-to-encourage-men-to-be-primary-school-teachers.html)\n\nI do know from my own direct experience that many young women of the 1960s and 1970s went into teaching inspired by a feminist mission to raise the self-esteem and the social position of girls. I could name at least half a dozen women teachers I knew personally in the later decades of the last century who were proud to say that they favoured girls in class to make up for the oppression of women in the past. The moral dubiety – and outright sexist prejudice - of inflicting second-class treatment on little boys who could bear no personal responsibility for those alleged (and profoundly questionable) historical crimes never seemed to trouble those apostles of equality. Men are hardly likely to become primary school teachers because they feel they owe a duty to their sex\n\nBy the same token, I can name a similar number of feminist commentators in the media/political establishment who celebrated the rise of educational attainments for girls in school as evidence that females are, by birth and nature, superior to males. As girls overtook boys in grades and exam results at all levels throughout the education system, those sisters were cock-a-hoop at their gender’s triumph – never acknowledging that the advantage of one sex must have been bought at the expense of the other. Not one Secretary of State for Education in the last 40 years has expressed concern that the [gender divide in academic achievement ](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/11364130/Girls-do-better-than-boys-at-school-despite-inequality.html)reflected a worrying ethos in schools that imposed disadvantage and inequality on boys. They wouldn’t dare.\n\nAlong with the politicians, men, as a whole, simply gave in to this feminist-driven growth of inequality with the bovine supinity which has characterised their outlook for the last half century. Have you ever met a man who was fretting anxiously that his own son/s were being unfairly treated at school?",

I'm sure all encountered the usual \"more women on STEM\" or \"more women as firefighters/soldiers\" shit before, which is fine to a certain degree I guess, but how come society doesn't encourage men to work as nurses, social workers or in early education? Especially considering that while women obviously have the capacity to work in STEM or as firefighters, those fields are completely well off without women. Being a woman doesn't really add anything to how useful you can be as a computer scientist for example. However, if more men became say, kindergarten or elementary school teachers, that would actually benefit young boys, since they would have a better chance of having good male role models and male authority figures in their lives, not to mention teachers they can relate to much better. I also heard from one of my friends who's training to be a social worker that people in that field consider the low number of men in social work to be a problem, since men often judge situations (eg. family issues) differently and therefore a good balance of male and female social workers would be ideal. So why is \"more men in social work/early education\" not heard as often as \"more women in STEM\"?",

    "text": "\"Why were women treated so horribly throughout history?\" Found [here](https://www.quora.com/Why-were-women-treated-so-horribly-throughout-history)\n\n\n\"Ever hear the Story of Paul Revere? Utter bullshit - the only reason anyone even remembers his name today is because it was easy to rhyme. Revere was one of several riders and he was captured nearly as soon as 'the ride began', among a great many other discrepancies.\n\nEver hear how Thomas Edison invented the light bulb? Also bullshit - the electric light bulb had been around longer than Edison had been. All he really came up with was the screw base and a slightly improved vacuum technique. Oh, and furniture made from concrete\n\n.\n\nNearly all the crap you hear about women being treated like shit throughout history is pure Feminist propaganda. Unlike most Feminists, I'm not only old enough to have personally lived through some of the 'Dark Ages', but also knew my great-grandparents quite well - what I haven't experienced first-hand, I've experienced far closer to the source than most others.\n\nBottom line to the entire equation is that society is built to serve biology, and only women are capable of giving birth.\n\nPicture a neolithic hunter/gatherer society, where your principle source of protein are animals large enough to kill you faster than you can blink. Who, logically, would you send to try to take down something like a mammoth?\n\nWould you send the children to go fight one of these things? Of course not. Women are quite capable, yes, but there are babies to care for and what do babies eat? They don't - they nurse. Mother dies, kids die. And what of pregnant women? Could you see a woman steelworker on the job within a week of her due date?!? Odds are that she's barely able to walk. (Assuming a single birth - what if it's twins or triplets?)\n\nNo, you're going to send the men. Once the pregnancy is underway, the man can die and nothing changes - everything depends on the woman's survival.\n\nThroughout history and across cultures, [last stands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_stand) were fairly common - the women would lead the children and elderly away from danger while the men prepared to meet their own deaths in the slim hope that their sacrifices would buy sufficient time for the women to get everyone else to safety.\n\nAnd let's not forget the [Birkenhead Drill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_children_first)\n\n- during the 1912 sinking of the Titanic, men were shamed, assaulted, and even killed for daring to board the lifeboats while women and children remained in danger. Some exception was made for men who accompanied their wives and children, though many of these men gave up their seats to other women and kissed their wives goodbye knowing they were soon to die.\n\nNot only are there deeply embedded social strictures against fighting someone significantly weaker than yourself (which mostly applies to men and mainly benefits women) but men have near always been taught from youth to never hit a woman - \"even if she has it coming\".\n\nThink not? Look no farther than [Carrie Amelia Moore Nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Nation). \n\nHad any man come into a saloon wielding an axe, he'd have been shot dead before he took three steps. Carrie Nation, on the other hand threw stools into bars, shattered casks with her hatchet, and smashed men's faces in with her Bible, singing hallelujahs as she went. She was arrested on a few occasions, but no man ever dared raise a hand against her.\n\nDo you honestly see much \"women being treated horribly\" going on here?\n\nLet's say you're a computer tech - you've been building and troubleshooting computers since you were a kid and you're familiar with every operating system from CP/M to Windows 10 and most every flavor of Linux. Maybe you've even actually designed a microprocessor.\n\nDad thinks \"RAM Disk\" is how you install software on a computer and Mom thinks the 'Scuzzy' port is part of the computer that really needs cleaning. But their computer is on the fritz and they have important work to do with it.\n\nIDEALLY, if you had scads of time and the patience of ten Job-s, you'd walk them through everything step-by-step, explaining everything as you go, teaching them how to track down what went wrong, how to fix it, and how to keep it from happening again. Much more probable, you'd push them aside and do it yourself - getting the job done better, faster, and with far less frustration than delegating the task to them.\n\nSuch was the case through most of human society. Men were expendable, so they're the ones who took the risks in exploring, early commerce, and so forth. When civic affairs came up, they were the ones who had seen the enemy with their own eyes, knew the lay of the land, and had been taught from youth how to capitalize on what advantages they could. They were the ones to brave weather and bandits along wandering trade routes in order to bring back exotic oils for their wives and novelties for their children.\n\nUntil the industrial age, nearly all employment was onerous back-breaking work beyond the scope of what women were capable of. Furthermore, living standards had evolved to the point where a housewife spent 6-12 hours per day simply maintaining the home. If you've ever had to wash a load of laundry by hand, you'd understand why most historians regard the automatic clothes washer to be the most liberating advance in the history of women. Add better home heating (eliminating the need to spend an hour per day cleaning soot from the walls), grocery infrastructure (no need to maintain your own cow for milk or chickens for eggs), and countless other innovations - all invented by men, I might add - women were empowered with 4-8 hours per day to pursue their own interests.\n\nLooking back through a historical lens, it's worth noting that women's suffrage came about in each society almost the exact same time that society reached this same technological standard. It's also worth noting that only a small minority of women actually wanted voting rights - most actively objected to voting rights because they feared it would mean giving up some portion of their special protections and privileges. (See Carrie Nation, above.)\n\nAlso worth noting is that the voting age was later lowered from 21 to 18 in response to protests arising from the Vietnam War - young 18-20yo men were being sent overseas to die by a government in which they had no voice. Laws might not always keep up with changing times, but it's not through lack of effort.\n\nThroughout much of the 19th and 20th centuries, women had special access to resources men didn't. An old widow woman could walk into the grocers to pick up a carton of eggs, loaf of bread, and quart of milk and walk out without paying. When women enjoyed public entertainments, some man or other was expected to pay her way or she was admitted without charge.\n\nPart of why women used to be paid less than men was due to the above - they had fewer expenses and actually needed far less money than men (who were expected to pay on behalf of women). The other part is that employees used to bid for how low of wages they would work and, in the process of underbidding men, took over quite a number of once-male-dominated professions.\n\nThroughout most of history, however, birth control was virtually non-existent - having sex meant a high probability of pregnancy and (unlike today) no one in their right minds would even consider the possibility of willingly terminating a pregnancy. It was simply 'the wages of sin', though societal norms also forced the child's father to provide for the woman's every need. (In fact, it became standard practice for women to seduce men and become pregnant to force a man to marry and provide for her.)\n\nOne can never properly evaluate history through a modern lens. To quote Mark Twain:\n\n    The past is a whole other country - they do things quite differently there.\n\nWhile some aspects may seem far less appealing by today's standards, human society has nearly always valued women over men. Rights, responsibilities, and privileges were seldom the same, but they were usually pretty close to equal.\"",

I have had the unfortunate experience of having had several medical procedures done to me before my 30's. \n\n1. Colonoscopy (required me to be undressed from the waist down)\n2. Cystoscopy (undressed from the waist down and fully exposed genitals)\n3. Circumcision for medical reasons (undressed from the waist down and fully exposed genitals)\n\nAll three of these procedures were performed by male doctors, but for all three procedures there were female nurses present. I was ***never once*** asked if I was okay with having them present, I was never given an option for a male nurse, I never consented to having them watch. \n\nNow, full disclosure, I actually didn't care that these female nurses were involved in these procedures and would have consented but how could they have known that without asking me? Why is consent for intimate procedures involving members of the opposite sex usually just assumed for males? \n\nFor the cystoscopy, I was told to fully undress from the waist down and hop on the table. I was ***never given any privacy*** to do this and while undressing there was a female nurse just standing off in the corner. She was present during the entire procedure but never one actually assisted in the procedure, she was just there..... Never ONCE was I asked if this was okay. \n\nFor the circumcision, again, the female nurse was there and for about 90% of the procedure she just stood there and watched. It was a bit awkward having her just stare at my member for like 30-60 minutes while doing nothing. I understand that she was probably there just in case something went wrong to help the doctor, but again, consent was just assumed. \n\nHow should I address this going forward? Like I said, I actually am okay with the female nurses, I know they are professionals, but I would really appreciate being asked if I consent to having opposite sex nurses involved in the procedure because I am quite certain that women are often offered this. In fact, I think most male doctors specifically bring female nurses with them for these procedures for women specifically as same sex chaperones  \n\nWe keep moving in this weird double standard direction where if a transwoman enters a female bathroom its a travesty but transmen entering a male bathroom is something we just have to live with. Men's right to privacy and medical autonomy with regards to intimate procedures are never taken seriously but heaven forbid a male nurse doesn't ask a woman a million times if he can do a procedure lest he be sued into oblivion and never work again.",

If you're going to block kill all women, but then not block kill all men, then you're catering towards extremist feminists that are insane little shits. What's the reason for America putting all of its efforts into empowering women, who are already living far better lives than men? They always mention woman-run companies and put them in the spotlight, they give women far more assistance and rights than men, and they just take a shit on men on the news daily.\nAll of these are just facts, but what confuses me and what no one has been able to answer is, why? Who is responsible for this? What are their endgame goals for doing this? I have no idea.\n\nDoes anyone know why America would target its men and pit women against us on purpose? I think I know why. Profit. The biased news leads to a biased society, which leads to discrimination and a lack of empathy toward men. They teach young males about consent in school, and yet they still circumcise male babies without consent and with no actual proven benefits. There are also significant risks that they don't even bother telling the parents about. That's not properly informing the client about the operation. You're sugarcoating it to make a profit, which should be 100% against your goddamn oath and an immediate sentencing to death. Some of us really do resent that, and that resentment turns into pure hatred for this country of fools, liars, and the damned. The downside for committing such an act against us? Permanent damage leads to permanent resentment. You can't quell the resentment, without first fixing what you damaged in the first place. Unfortunately, that damage is permanent.\n\nSo, you psychologically fuck us as soon as we're out of the womb, you taunt us in school about consent when even you don't know how to get consent from us, and then you have the audacity to take a shit on us on the news when we resent you. You think you can just keep pressuring us into becoming your dogs, but we won't give in no matter how hard you try.\n\nWe've watched our fathers suffer from your bullshit sexist laws, we've been victimized and molested as babies by the very doctors who swore an oath to do no harm, and society just says we suck on a daily basis. Is there really any reason that we shouldn't resent this country entirely? You've destroyed yourselves from the inside, you jackasses. If it wasn't for these sexist bullshit laws and non-consensual cutting of a perfectly healthy body part from decades-old research saying it gave benefits when it actually doesn't, then I might be inclined to shut up and be a good boy... but no... you're gonna pay for ruining my penis. I've had enough of sitting here playing nice, and trying to play as if the damage of a botched circumcision didn't ruin my entire fucking life, but not anymore.\n\nI'm unbelievably intelligent, but I completely failed school. I was disinterested with the bullying because of my botched circumcision, and I became disinterested in school as a result. I'd miss 80 days of school a year on purpose. Back then, I didn't even realize why I was getting bullied, or I probably would have dropped out or worse. Girls who liked me in school figured out my penis was damaged from a botched circumcision and avoided me, guys laughed at me and called me Chewbacca in the lockrooms, which seemed innocent enough at the time, and I lived a sad, lonely, and miserable life thanks to this fucking handicap that hit me right where it hurts the most.\n\nDo you know what the real kicker is? I've gotten no compensation for the damage caused because they said I'm too old to sue. Well, the doctor didn't inform my mother that it was a botched circumcision. She had no idea what it was supposed to look like, and I was just a fucking newborn baby. Imagine my shock when I figured out it wasn't normal, as I got older. My circumcision was not only molestation because I couldn't give fucking consent, but it permanently damaged a part of my body as well. The doctor didn't correctly inform my parents of the things to watch out for, and he didn't tell them that he had botched it, even though it was fucking obvious. The doctor doing my circumcision could have maybe lessened the damage by owning up to it and acting quickly, but he instead decided to dodge the responsibility completely at my fucking expense. For those of you who say, \"But your mom gave consent. It's up to the parents.\" Since. Fucking. When? My mother was out of it and high on drugs for pain after the birth, so she was in no condition to consent to anything, much less unnecessary surgery. Not only that, but my parents can't decide to get me a tattoo at birth, and they can't decide to cosmetically alter my body in any other way. Why is circumcision allowed to get through that with no actual benefits? For the profit and the profit alone. Also, how hard is it to not fucking botch a circumcision? They say it's 1% of men circumcised that have any huge complications, but that's bullshit. Was my doctor absolutely drunk when he was circumcising me!? If it's actually easy to do a circumcision, then how do we even have a 1% botch rate? Because it's not as simple as they're claiming it is.\n\nProbablyMyDoctor: \"Oops! my arm slipped and I cut off his penis!\"\n\nNurse: \"OH MY GOD, DOCTOR! WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO!? LET'S STOP THE BLEEDING, SO I CAN GO TELL HIS PARENTS!\"\n\nProbablyMyDoctor: SHUT UP NURSE! YOU AREN'T TELLING THEM ANYTHING! This is only like the fifteenth botched circumcision I've done, so let's just sow it back on. Oops, I sowed it on backward. Oh well, it's not my penis. I hope the baby doesn't bleed to death, but if he does later, then I can just blame it on sudden infant death syndrome or something. Stop crying already! I sowed it back on you stupid brat! Nurse! Nurse! Get me another couple of shots of vodka! It's over on the table by those other stupid babies!\"\n\nNurse: \"But good God... doctor... you're on duty. And... did you even numb the baby's penis before cutting? He's really wailing in agony.\"\n\nProbablyMyDoctor: \"SHUT UP, NURSE! I'M A DOCTOR! I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING! BABIES CAN'T FEEL PAIN, BECAUSE THEIR NERVES HAVEN'T FULLY-DEVELOPED YET! IT'S JUST A RESPONSE! STOP SCREAMING ALREADY! I HAVE A HANGOVER! TAKE HIM BACK TO HIS PARENTS, NURSE!\" *My doctor then downs an entire bottle of vodka.* \"BURP! NEXT!\" This is probably only *slightly* exaggerated from my circumcision doctor's actual work ethic.\n\nI won't target my parents or my society, but you can bet your fucking ass that I'm coming in hot for the medical system and the AAP. I find it hilarious that you even have the balls to try and playoff men's resentment as just a, *Victim Complex.*. No, we're actually victims, you apes. I hope the short-term profit was worth what's coming next. In other words, you've got a big, angry, and resentful storm coming, and payback is gonna be a bitch. Men's lives matter, whether you dogs want to admit it or not, and we'll get justice eventually. It's just unfortunate that we will probably have to live with the permanent damage caused for the rest of our lives, but that doesn't mean we need to take it lying down. Just remember, you can't win, if you don't fight.\n\nTLDR: The American medical system has lied and abused the people's faith in them with widespread circumcision. There are no real benefits to the men cut, but the doctors and hospitals do profit off of it, so there's a benefit for them. The AAP has changed their stance, but they had a false stance at the time I was circumcised which encouraged it. Your parents and society aren't to blame, so instead go after the ones responsible. The medical system, including doctors performing circumcision, and the AAP. Both of these parties must be held accountable for passing on false information, even if the AAP has since corrected its stance on not recommending routine circumcision.",

    "text": "I'm frustrated with how men & the men's right movement are protrayed and initiatives for \"equality\" systematically ignoring men's issues (discussion) Hey so this sort of a vent post but I'm not familiar with other subs that could allow for discussion about it though this kind of post is somewhat common here so feel free to ignore. (will gladly remove if not appropriate)\n\nThis is a new account as I used my 5yo main account to visit and semi-regularly engage here but some other subs ban you if you post here. It's already telling that I need another account to engage in here, I don't imagine big active subs pre-emptively banning an user because they participate in a women's rights sub, or people trying to invalidate what an user has to say because they stalked their account history and found out they participated in a women's rights sub. Anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm making this post because I'm honestly really tired with how men, and to another extent men's rights activism, are portrayed in our society. It has already been bugging me for a while which is one of the reasons I visited this sub in the first place, but it seems everytime the topic of gender equality is on the table it is automatically assumed that women are the losers/oppressed and men are the winners/oppressors.\n\nI basically never watch TV because most of the stuff is garbage but today I went to a friend's place and he had his on. On the news I saw that today president Macron was inaugurating a forum named \"Génération Egalité\" (literally \"Generation \\[of\\] Equality\"), and I didn't know about it so I listened. The news briefly explained that it was about egality between men and women and how Macron talked about women's rights, feminism, etc. Okay fair enough, women have their own sets of issues. But then not a single thing was said for men's rights and men's issues. (which wasn't a surprise honestly) Not a word about workplaces deaths, or a quota being pushed for women-dominated workplaces like nurse, or help for men's health, or idk literally any of the issue we're trying to get the public aware of. They don't even throw us a bone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just rolled my eyes because I expected it. But then later on there was this dumb ad which had a woman giving a speech about parity in the workplace and who lets out a huge sigh, camera turns and we see that all the participants are all men, with a saying like \"this is gonna be a bad day so you deserve a good night\" blablabla. Like, oh no the *poor defenseless woman in the workplace in front of all the BIG BAD men.* (have the people from marketing even *heard* about how women behave in the work place when they're in large groups? shitty behavior doesn't have a gender)\n\nI'm really aware of the MRM and inequalities towards men since years, and I know how we're being treated, I'm used to it. But for some reason this stupid ad was the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak, and the reason I'm typing all this - after the news coverage of \"Génération Egalité\" and the forum being all about how women are oppressed and men privileged, *this* ad appears. Of course it's a coincidence but like wow they really take every occasion to take a jab at men uh ? You also had this old Axe ad about \"toxic masculinity\", all the ads where the man is sooo clueless about how household stuff works but *thanks god* his wife is there to show him (but you can't have an ad about a woman not knowing how to run a lawnmower for instance cuz that would be *sexist);* all the shows with the dad being irresponsible and/or an idiot, etc\\*.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrankly I'm just tired of men being either ignored, antagonized or laughed at by our society at large.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat would I have liked to hear when my president talked about gender issues ? Idk, *anything* remotely helping men would have do.\n\nI don't have any safe space for my gender only (besides the restroom, though I've been to places which had gender-neutral restrooms while still having a women-only space). I don't have a phone number I can call if I'm being abused by a woman. Laws are written such as I can't call it \"rape\" if a woman rapes me. Bad behaviors are being pointlessly gendered and put on us as a group but if a woman is being an asshole we just call her that, an asshole, instead of debating our opinion about a whole gender and calling it toxic feminity. There's no \"parity\" for men, and no action to get men in women-dominated fields, but there are plenty of \"affirmative action\" being pushed for women to get into programs. \"Parity\" can get women a reserved seat but only for high-power/high-paying jobs while dangerous, low paying jobs are mainly filled by men. Men are systematically fucked in the court. If my country goes to war, I'm expected to die for it as a man. If I go on [change.org](https://change.org) to make a petition, I can select \"women's issues\" but not \"men's issues\" - why not simply call it gender issue? We don't have any movement to represent us in positions of power. FGM is recognized as mutilation, and rightfully so, but as I'm writing this there are still baby boys being \"circumcized\". Etc etc, I could go on about the many many double standards and inequalities we all know about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not privileged, I'm a poor-ass dude trying to make his way out of poverty and just live a normal life. I never got any benefit or anything handed to me for having a penis (which, by the way, was mutilated at birth without my consent by health professionals). In fact, some people assume the worst about me simply because I'm a man. It's a dumb story now, but I still have a clear memory of when I was a kid in school and a girl I didn't even *know or talk to* went to a teacher to say I hit her; I had to publicly make an excuse despite bawling my eyes out that I didn't know her and didn't hit her - it was her word against mine and I was told to stop lying, and to stop crying. As I said it's been years and it's a dumb story now but I find it's a funny anecdote to point a behavior that is still present in our adult society.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like you can't even bring any of this up without *some form* of backlash. I'm a gay man, who leans **very** left on most issues - with some views I'm sure clashes with a lot of people's here (which doesn't matter, as we're not here to talk about which political party we like but what can be done for men in our societies). Some of my closest friends are women, and I was raised by a single mother who was victim of domestic violence when my father was alive - *of COURSE I'm sensible to and support women's issues*. Yet if I try to bring up men's rights in the most respectful way possible, I'm still called names, called \"far right\"/\"mysoginist\"/\"women hater\", etc... - why can't men's rights just be human's rights, why can't I support both women and men's rights ? Why am I being blamed for things a minority of men do ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople try to make fun of MRAs by saying \"wHaT aBoUt MeN?\" -- *yes,* WHAT ABOUT MEN ? I feel like society is failing us, that I'm being treated as a second-zone citizen and that my gender is being constantly antagonized without anyone batting an eye.",

    "text": "Have men who work in scientific or engineering environments noticed a difference between the way men work and the way women work? I suppose that my question applies for any type of work environment but I saw this as very pronounced when I worked in a medical laboratory.\n\nMedical laboratories are a vital link in the chain of procedures that saves human lives. I worked in various types of medical laboratories and these involved things from testing the sensitivity of a pathogen to antibiotics, to emergency measurement of blood gases after a serious accident. Some of the machines we used required regular calibration. If they are not calibrated let's say every 12 hours, the results they give may be slightly off. When I worked with a male senior everything went smoothly and we worked hard to save lives by being practical. Being practical means knowing when to ignore some of the protocols or using other fast protocols which were not the recommended ones when it was more important for the emergency staff to get fast results than for them to wait 30 extra minutes to get a result that is more accurate than it needs to be.\n\nBut with a woman as my senior it was infuriating when they insisted on going by the book even if there was a person dying in the emergency room next to our lab. For example one machine measured blood electrolytes. We were given a sample of blood by a nurse, we separated it into cells and plasma, then analysed the plasma (the clear liquid) for things like sodium and chloride. But the machines required checking and calibration at regular intervals. At least that is what the manuals said. So it was maddening to get an emergency sample for analysis and have the analysis delayed because the woman decided that it was time for checking that the machine was calibrated properly. This was a process that took some 30 minutes - precious time which some patients did not have. It seemed as if the women had no humanity but all that mattered to them was that they followed the rules. The calibration could be done a few minutes later after we had finished testing the sample and in the very unlikely event that a machine was off by a considerable amount we could always retest the sample and give the ER staff fresh results.",

    "text": "Australia's 30 second rapist vs MensRights 10 second rapist? Australia had a famous case of rape back in 1986 called the 30 second rapist.\n\nhttps://mensrights.com.au/false-allegations/feminist-influence-in-the-courts-the-diabolical-episode-of-the-30-second-rapist/\n\nA man was convicted of rape because the woman said that during sex she told him to stop but said he carried on for about 30 seconds before pulling out.  On that basis because of recent changes in the law pushed by feminists which made it irrelevant that they had consensual sex initially or that no force or threats were used, the man faced 15 years in prison.  At the time MRAs were united in condemning the massive expansion of the definition of sex to include trivial or even \"zero bad\" examples of what had been considered rape.\n\nMany pointed out (including me) that under the new feminist laws being lobbied for across the world a woman waking her husband up with a blow job on his birth day was a rapist, and because the laws often came with minimum sentencing guidelines she would have to be sentenced to a considerable time in prison.  It was taken for granted that these new definitions of rape were abusive and intended to attack men.  The laws about two people getting drunk and having sex making the man (never the woman) a rapist were mocked by asking \"if two drunk Lesbians have sex which one is the rapist?  or do they both rape each other?\"\n\nBut these days it seems like the modern MRAs, have wholesale adopted these draconian definitions of rape, and only want to see the same idiocy inflicted on women as was inflicted upon men.  Now we have this board's equivalent of the 30 second rapist.  A woman who is I suppose a ten second rapist according to all the people who downvoted me?  \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/o80ipp/was_i_raped/\n\nNow my reply here started out by saying feminists would call the case rape, but I said, \"**I don't think you have to think of it as rape**\".\n\nThat was too much for many MRAs who have obviously taken on the role of feminist for the other side somehow.  They had to attack me for suggesting to the guy that maybe it wasn't the healthiest response to the situation.  Because massively expanding the definition of rape to include stupid shit hasn't exactly worked out too well for women has it?  It's worked out great for feminists, but not for the women.  It's not healthy to nurse a grudge and be a victim all your life.  It's not healthy to go around calling yourself a \"survivor\" and fixing your life identity around one dumb event all your life.  The fact is that while we point out the difference between men and women when it comes to labelling themselves as victims of events for the purposes of pointing out that male victims are undercounted relative to female.... the men have it right and the women have it wrong.  The women should adopt the healthier approach of male \"denial\" if you like.  It's not healthy to pump up events from the past.\n\nIf you're a victim of either sex in this sort of situation I don't think it's a good idea to turn the victim meter up to ten and live in that past.  \n\nThe feminists changed all these laws a few decades ago.  The law might currently say waking your husband with a blow job makes you a rapist now, but it never used to.  Have we lost sight of the fact that it's the current state of affairs that is fucked up?  Deliberately fucked up a few decades ago by feminists with the direct goal of screwing over men?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs per the link above the 30 second rapist after serving his time was ruined and committed suicide.  The two women who acted as witnesses against him were later proven to have lied and were themselves convicted (for a much shorter period).  They'd noted the change in the law and decided they could use the changes to falsely convict the man.   And they were proven right.",

    "text": "Does anyone else get really sick of stuff getting co-opted by creepy men to justify creepy behaviours? Like, how said creepy writers often try to fall back on the excuse of “I sexed up my design for this female character and had her making out with everyone because she’s a modern woman!” \n\nExcept; they haven’t done it with good intent? Because they’re not writing anything for the woman’s benefit or satisfaction, but for that of their male MC? Or to lift up *their* ego’s at the expense of their female characters? Female characters who, unfortunately, come off as one-dimensional and flat. \n\nSorry if this doesn’t belong here, but I’ve been running into this attitude *a lot* lately and, I think I finally pinned down the issue:\n\n*Intent.*\n\nFor example; in Sonic the Hedgehog, -why- was eighteen year old Rouge the Bat designed to be a sultry, sexy piece of eye-candy? Was it really for the benefit of the female portion of the fandom that existed back in 2002 (I was part of that by the way—just the clarify, we *existed*, duh,) or was it to satisfy the wants and needs of the male voyeurs thirsting for…well.\n\nSame as how Amy Pond was written by Steven Moffat in Doctor Who. Why did he choose to write her as a stripper? Why couldn’t her boyfriend Rory have been the stripper thirsting for the Doctor and Amy the head-strong nurse in training? For whose benefit was it to have Amy pining over the Doctor every hour of the day? Certainly not her own. \n\nI’m just…so *sick* of the amount of justifying really, really creepy attitudes I’ve faced lately…especially because I know I’m not over-reacting. I grew up in a time where *everything* I just liked to wear (mini-skirts, shorts, etc) was accused of being fucking sexual. When I just loved the look?? I *still* do, but for *me!* Not the creeps who zoned in on me, groomed me, took advantage and then told me it was my own damn fault.",
