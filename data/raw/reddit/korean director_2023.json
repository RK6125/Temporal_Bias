    "text": "How to keep track of 50 students in a foreign country? I am going to be a resident director for a scholarship program that sends 50 American high school kids to Korea to study the language.\n\nAs a former high school exchange student in Korea, I am very excited, but also nervous about one of the kids potentially getting lost during the 6-week program. Each of them will be staying with a host family somewhere in Seoul, so all of them will have different commutes to and from the study center and to any field trips we would go on. Many of them have never traveled abroad or used public transportation, and all of them will be beginners at the Korean language.\n\nWhat are some ways that I can keep track of the kids' locations so I can make sure that they are safe throughout the duration of the program? I've thought about putting a Samsung Smart Tag (Apple Tags don't work here) on the lanyards they are required to wear 24/7 so that I can figure out where they are if they get lost and their phone is dead, but I'm not sure how feasible or legal that is.\n\nI don't care what they do in their spare time as long as it's safe, but thinking about trying to track down a lost child in a metropolitan area of 25 million people is honestly freaking me out. Do you have any creative suggestions or solutions that you have used on field trips, class trips, etc.?",
