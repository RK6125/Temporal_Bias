    "text": "Canceled interview four hours after scheduled? Today I was out and about when I got a call from a law firm I had applied to for an administrative assistant position. The manager asked me to expand on what she saw in my resume as a pre-screen before she offered me an interview.\n\nWe talked for about 20 minutes about my qualifications and my salary needs and then she asked if I'd like to come in for an interview tomorrow. Of course! We set it up and I was elated. \n\nI went and got my hair done to look my absolute best. I went home and put an outfit together and set to work printing out copies of my resume and other materials.\n\nFor clarity, the original call happened at about 1PM. I got a second call at exactly 5PM. The same woman said they would have to cancel my interview. She said that they had extended an offer \"this afternoon\" to another candidate. She did say that she didn't know \"he\" made the offer. I assume she means the lawyer.\n\nAm I crazy or is this super unprofessional? I'm not going to lie to myself and pretend it's impossible that this woman set up the interview and then someone else didn't like my credentials and told her to pull the plug. But in any case, I can't help but feel like this was incredibly uncool. Thoughts?",

I was referred to them by my ob/gyn for their \"new mothers\" program!** Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/atwfyl/all_the_steps_my_obgyn_made_me_take_to_have_an/?utm_source=reddit-android\n\n2nd Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/av6f30/update_2_my_obgyn_tried_forcing_me_into_having_a/\n\nConclusion: https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/avdzo8/conclusion_my_obgyn_tried_forcing_me_into_having/\n\n---\nI am so livid right now. These people just DON'T STOP! \n\nEarlier today I cancelled my next appointment and happily told them about my abortion tomorrow. And just a few hours later, the woman from the shelter called me. \n\nHearing the name, I'm thinking *wtf, my husband doesn't abuse me*. The woman started her spiel and I was very curious to hear her out. Apparently the program is to have in-home counseling, information about fetus development, etc. Basically counseling for women keeping an unwanted pregnancy. \n\nI got very scared for tomorrow reading about the abortion, so I told my husband about it. He got really disgusted and, \"didn't want me to tell him about the actual procedure, it's barbaric.\" So now I'm back, telling it to all of you. And I don't think he meant to sound so insensitive, this obviously affects him, too. \n\nTo any women out there who are pregnant and unsure: if your dr tells you to go to *x*, *y*, *z* appointment first to have the abortion, try calling an actual abortion clinic or other ob/gyn and see what they say. Don't get tricked like I did. \n\n**Edit: Thanks again to everyone for your support!** I'm honestly so scared that I've been vomiting constantly all day, and have a wicked headache (no aspirin 24 hours prior to the procedure). So I may not respond right away, but I am reading every comment and you guys have really helped me to get through these past 4 days!üíó  \n\nI will likely be posting an update tomorrow or the day after to let you all know how it went :) \n\n**And as for my husband,** I think I inaccurately portrayed him in a very negative way, and he's not that guy at all. He is a very supporting man; he found me at rock bottom, helped me out of the dirt and abusive relationship, and brush myself off (as a friend). If things didn't work out so well now, he would have signed off on an adoption and not shown me how much it broke his heart. This started as a wanted pregnancy, we had been trying for over a year and even went through a miscarriage last March, so I know he's as upset as I am. I'm not trying to excuse his behavior, he reacted very poorly.  This is just really stressful for both of us, and I hope that in the upcoming days he can compartmentalize what happened for a bit and just *be there* for me. \n\n**Edit 2: As for everyone encouraging me to see a lawyer,** I actually have one for a separate lawsuit. I have a meeting set for ~1 week from now and will be discussing it with him then and see where we can go from there. \n\nI also never considered the social worker calling me to be a HIPAA violation! Thank you for pointing that out to me! I definitely never signed any consent to share info forms, and I'm one of those people that reads/skims before signing anything.",

    "text": "Thwarting my step mom's plans for \"revenge\". \nMy relationship with my step mom began going down hill when I hit my teens. She began to emotionally bully me , mostly just for not thinking what she thinks and not wanting to be exactly like her. She had a lot of internalized misogyny and thinks that even if a woman has a career she should be a housewife first and a doctor/lawyer/executive next. And the man must ALWAYS be the main bread earner. In her moments of anger she would often say to me \"I'll be there to laugh at you when your kids disappoint you and act like they're better than you.\"\n\nI knew even then that I didn't want kids, but knew better than to voice this opinion, given the time and place in my life. Then when I reached financial independence, I was able to tell people I didn't want kids when they asked me when I would \"settle down\" and start a family. The reactions I got ranged from understanding to anger.\n\nWhen step mom found out about my plans she lost her ever loving shit! She told me I *had* to have kids. I *had* to go through what she went through. My dad tried to calm her down but she angrily told him to \"talk some sense into his daughter\". She then turned to me and asked what I would do when my future husband demands kids. I told her I don't want to get married either. (I'm open to the idea of marriage, if it's something my partner wants , but this was just too much fun!) On hearing this she walked into the kitchen and we could hear her throwing around pots and pans. My dad looked at me accusingly, as if to say \"thanks a lot, now I'll be dealing with this for a whole week. Goodbye peace of mind ,it was nice knowing you! \"\n\nThis happened nearly a decade ago and still makes me smile with satisfaction when I think about it.",

    "text": "[Trigger Warning] Tomorrow, I'm facing him in court again. I'm doing it for her. Standard-- FTP, sorry for any formatting issues.  Also, this is a repost because I didn't use the TW tag correctly the first time, sorry again!\n\n\nI dated a guy for about a year that was emotionally, mentally, physically, and sexually abusive. He broke up with me (I know it‚Äôs horrible that I didn‚Äôt break up with him, but the domestic violence cycle for victims is a hell of a thing) around the time I got into my first choice doctoral program. So, I moved away to attend that program, excited for a new life. Before I moved, I started therapy because of what my ex did to me, and with my therapist‚Äôs and parents‚Äô encouragement and support, I reported to local police what my ex did to me and moved away the literal next day. I moved about 6 hours away from where home is and started a new life. I spent so long working full time to put myself through school, and finally school got to be my job. It was really my dream.\n\n\nSo imagine my horror when, that following December, Satan (my pet name for my ex) started contacting me again. I was in a new relationship that suffered greatly because of his contact, and I want to be clear that I told him many times, in no uncertain terms, that I did not want him to contact me ever under any circumstances. He told me that he moved, and now lived within half an hour of me. This is terrifying for (hopefully) obvious reasons. I had no idea if he knew I had reported him to the police, and he is hard to predict, so it felt feasible to me that he would contact me knowing that I reported him. This started a year of unwanted contact that included phone calls, voicemails (both lewd and normal ones), and messages over various texting apps. Regardless of how many times I told him very plainly to leave me alone, he would respond with things like: 1) ‚ÄúJust block me.‚Äù But that wouldn‚Äôt work, because he would make fake accounts to message me from. 2) ‚ÄúJust stop responding.‚Äù But that wouldn‚Äôt work, because he would continue to message me regardless of whether I answered. 3) ‚ÄúYou love this, you love the attention, don‚Äôt deny it.‚Äù ---this one disgusted me more than the other 2.\n\n\nAround this time, my mother contacted the police department that I reported the DV and sexual assault to. According to the police, they couldn‚Äôt find him to ever question him, despite having his full name, birthdate, phone number, employer, Facebook page, and parents‚Äô address. Their response to him having moved close to me? ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have the manpower to send anyone down there, sorry.‚Äù I think it‚Äôs worth mentioning that his family is prominent in that town/county, and also that after I made the report that was never investigated, the officer that took my statement was promoted. I am in no way making any causal claims here, but chronologically, this is what happened.\n\n\nNow, many people may wonder why I didn‚Äôt just block him. The reason may not make sense to people who haven‚Äôt been in an abusive relationship, but it‚Äôs the only answer I have to that question. I didn‚Äôt block him because if he was going to contact me, I wanted to know about it. I didn‚Äôt want the contact in the first place, but he knew where I worked, so he could have just walked up to my office any time. Blocking his number/accounts wouldn‚Äôt stop him from seeing me against my will, and he would make fake accounts anyway, so blocking was ineffective. He terrifies me. There are times that I did block him, but I ended up unblocking him every time because‚Ä¶. I mean, just imagine that the person who put you through hell and forcibly stripped away your humanity (it was a fairly violent and fully penetrative rape that I fought verbally and physically against) and who has physical access to you is trying to contact you‚Ä¶. wouldn‚Äôt you want to know what they were saying? I wanted to be able to know‚Ä¶. that‚Äôs the only explanation I have. I am scared of him, and I didn‚Äôt want to be in the dark.\n\n\nHe would call me incessantly until I answered. At one point, he called me so many times in a row that I finally just answered the call, left the call running, and put my phone in the corner of the living room while I continued my conversation with my roommate (who was and has always been aware of this entire situation). After around 15 minutes, I went to pick up my phone, assuming he would have hung up and called 30 more times. But, again to my horror, he had stayed on the line the whole time, just quietly saying my name over and over. He would leave me voicemails about what he wanted to do to me sexually. He would message me asking to get back together, which honestly baffled me that he would even think I would be open to that idea. But no matter how mean I was in my responses, or how emphatic I was that I literally did not want to hear from him ever again, he would persist.\n\n\nIt escalated when, over 2 days, he messaged me between 60-70 times without me responding whatsoever. These messages said things like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather hurt than feel nothing at all,‚Äù and, ‚ÄúCan I buy some cookies from you?‚Äù This may sound innocuous, but I had just baked cookies earlier that day. I don‚Äôt know how to explain this message from him, because I don‚Äôt bake cookies frequently enough to just assume I should always have some around, but I also had no reason to think he knew where I lived. However, a Google search of my name and university (which he knew) would turn out my literal office number, and this concerned me because I didn‚Äôt want him putting my labmates, research assistants, and participants at risk by showing up to my office. Additionally, he told me in these messages that he would be moving away in 5 months, and he knew he would see me soon. I feel like these messages are disturbing for obvious reasons. So, I went to campus police.\n\n\nThey immediately took my concerns seriously and had me speak with a security specialist. Both the officer and the specialist said to me (almost a direct quote), ‚ÄúSome of these message are disturbing. We don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a danger to anyone else, but he is a danger to your physical safety. Do not go anywhere by yourself, even during the day. Notify the head of your academic department and take yourself off your lab‚Äôs website.‚Äù This is devastating to my future aspirations, and I already know that I have lost out on professional collaborative opportunities because people have been confused about not seeing me on our website.\n\n\nI left the station, and within an hour, the officer that took my statement called me back to say, ‚ÄúI just wanted you to know that he does in fact live in XCity like he said; we found an address for him there.‚Äù (Please contrast this information with the police department near my hometown, who told me that despite having much more concrete information on Satan than the campus police, they could not locate him to question him.)\n\n\nFast forward to about 7-8 months later, and I am notified through mail that the DA where I currently live has decided to press charges again Satan based on some of the evidence I provided. I had been planning a trip home, which I still followed through with. I made another visit to the original police department to make a supplemental report. Since my original report with them, Satan had admitted guilt to me regarding sexually assaulting me through a texting app, so I provided that to police. After returning to the city I currently live in, the court proceedings started. I had a court-appointed advocate accompany me, as well as 3 close friends. Satan did not expect me to be there, and I can‚Äôt tell you how satisfying it was to roll into the courtroom that deep and see him so unsettled.\n\n\nI want to just sum up what has happened so far in court. I‚Äôve been granted a no contact order for the duration of this case. However, due to either Satan or his lawyers either showing up late or not at all to certain hearings, we still do not have a guilty plea. At this point, we have been in court since last September and he still has not officially submitted a plea of any kind. Two absolutely fabulous DAs have been working on this case, and they have been so kind to me. They made sure I met with an investigator about a month or so ago, who collected every shred of evidence I possess of Satan contacting me. Based on this evidence, the DA‚Äôs offered plea deal is: he pleads guilty to misdemeanor harassment charges, I get an official 3-year no contact order, and we all move on. However, since he and his team have been difficult this whole time, the DAs will consider changing the plea to disturbance of the peace, which is still a misdemeanor. But somehow doesn‚Äôt feel nearly as satisfying as a harassment charge.\n\n\nRemember that supplemental report I made when I visited home? According to the DA on the current case, that police department has no record of that report being made. Cool.\n\n\nBut anyway, this has taken such an emotional and mental toll on me. It‚Äôs constant dread for weeks leading up to a court hearing, not knowing if today is the day I have to see him, be in the same room as him, get up in front of strangers and talk about the day my humanity was forcibly stripped away from me. Tomorrow seems to be that day.\n\n\nI‚Äôm sad that he took away my opportunity to enjoy graduate school. I worked so hard to get here, and I can barely function through it because immense stress starts to affect other things like your immune system, digestive functioning, working memory, and so on. I feel those effects everyday, and everyday it feels like he robbed me all over again, because I can‚Äôt enjoy the dream I worked so hard for.\n\n\nAnd every time the DA asks me if I‚Äôm ok with a change to the charges, the plea deal, am I available to come to court on Xday, and Xday, and Xday‚Ä¶. I want to say, ‚ÄúNo, just forget everything, I can‚Äôt handle this anymore.‚Äù But then I have to take a deep breath and remember, I‚Äôm not doing this for me. I‚Äôm doing it for her.\n\n\nHer = the next woman he abuses. I‚Äôm not the first, and I won‚Äôt be the last, but I promise you, wherever and whoever you are, I have done everything in my power to leave a paper trail. There wasn‚Äôt one for me, but there will be for you, and I hope you push through the crippling stress, anxiety, and trauma, and know that I did what I could to make your case more credible. I believe in you.\n\n\nHer = my future daughter/children. Don‚Äôt let anyone use and abuse you. You can stand up to them, and you can ask for help, and you can be brave. If I could be brave, anyone can, and I hope my future daughter can see that in me, even though I feel like the biggest coward on the face of the planet.\n\n\nHer = my mother, who was raped by a stranger when she was 16 but was too scared to tell her parents. She never got justice. Am I getting justice? I don‚Äôt know how to answer that question, but it‚Äôs better than she ever got, and she deserves to have seen that horrible excuse for a man be put in prison. But she didn‚Äôt get to. I have to do this for her.\n\n\nHer = every single other woman who has experienced harassment and abuse at the hands of a man and they were too afraid to speak up. I understand you. I see you. It‚Äôs never too late to speak out. Believe me when I say this is by far the scariest thing I have ever done, and I dread it constantly. I‚Äôm not special, I just asked for help from the police and finally got it. You can do it too. But if you feel like you can‚Äôt, please draw strength from me, because I believe in you.\n\n\n\nEDIT: for anyone who cared, he pled guilty to disturbance of the peace, I read my victim impact statement (which I cried the entire way through), and I was granted a 3 year NCO. It‚Äôs not harassment charges, but it‚Äôs also not a trial so I‚Äôm grateful. I‚Äôm relieved. It‚Äôs over. Thank you for your encouraging comments. I‚Äôm still processing my emotions, but I am so relieved. The judge took me seriously and said to Satan, ‚ÄúI hope you understand completely the terms of the no contact order, because if you violate that, given what I just heard, it will be taken very seriously.‚Äù  I was finally listened to, and that is invaluable.",

    "text": "Just have to vent as I am livid on behalf of my poor little cousin and her recent experiences with sexual harassment on the job Like the title says, I just need to vent because shit like this makes me so, so livid.\n\nMy little cousin graduated from college this spring with a degree in... I'm not sure what, something like environmental sciences. She wants to get her Master's degree and work for the government here in the US. \n\nShe's lived away from, but near, her home while in college, on the East Coast. This summer she got a short-term dream job with the government out west, I'm not sure what she's doing but it's in remote locations working out in the woods in small teams. My aunt helped pack up a tiny U-Haul trailer and drive her out west, my cousin and her pet snake, for the summer job.\n\nAnd it has been a disaster. Now, my cousin absolutely loves the work she's doing. It's a bit rough as she's out in the woods for 12+ hour days and hasn't been much for camping, and now she's dealing with peeing and pooping and periods in the wild. But she loves the actual work she's doing.\n\nBut she's been the victim of increasing amounts of sexual harassment and she finally broke down and called my aunt this past week in tears about wanting to go home. It's the first time she shared what was going on. My aunt did offer to come get her but also talked about how she should go to HR absolutely to report these assholes, and after my cousin did that this week she decided to stay on.\n\nSee, she's on a six-person team and she's the only female, it's her a bunch of guys. She's also the newbie, the other guys have been on the job for months. Being new she's a little slower as she learns how to do things. And the guys, all of them, are assholes.\n\nThey keep sexually harassing her, blatantly so, asking her about the guys she's had sex with, does she swallow, will she give them blowjobs, what about for twenty bucks. I cannot **believe** that this shit happens in this day and age! And they're mad because she's rebuking them all on sexual advances so they do things like forge ahead really fast in the woods, leaving her behind and there are dangers out there, bears and stuff, they're supposed to always be in pairs. \n\nAnd to make matters worse, they set them up in cabins and she has one of the asshole guys as a roommate! Un-fucking-believable.\n\nShe finally went to HR after a month of this and of course, heads are rolling. Not as many heads as I'd like. The two that were the most blatantly harassing her are being fired today, and with a sexual harassment firing on their records I doubt they will ever find a government job again. The other three are being subjected to 'disciplinary actions'. Oh, and this shit is not isolated to her. There are very few women working at this work station but she talked to another woman and the same things had been happening to her, and she'd had encounters with the same men before. She hadn't reported it as she didn't want to hurt her job prospects by 'making waves', but when my cousin went to HR so did this other woman who backed her up. \n\nMy cousin refuses to room with another guy and my aunt is paying money she doesn't have for my cousin to have a little condo she can live in by herself, no male roomies. I'm sure not all the guys are completely fucking assholes but she is not wanting to try again.\n\nThe work project is changing their team structure, women are very scarce and they are making it so that they are assigned at least two women to a team, so there's never a lone woman on a team of men out in the middle of the woods, all alone, again.\n\nI am so, so, so angry on behalf of my cousin. This is her first 'career' job after college and it sucks that she loves the job but encountered such asshole coworkers. I told my aunt that she could talk to a labor lawyer, maybe see about getting her private accommodation covered on account of such blatant harassment in the workplace. But the thing is, this is a government job and my cousin wants a career in government and she is afraid that if she rocks the boat too much, it'll affect her career advancement going forward. That's why she waited so long to say anything even to her mom.\n\nSo, so, so mad on her behalf, I can barely type after hearing about this. I'm a middle-aged female and I've had a few incidents but they were always much more subtle, nothing as blatant as asking to pay for fucking blowjobs and in the middle of the woods with a bunch of guys and no cellphone coverage. \n\nSome men are fucking assholes. I hope the next team she gets on is a lot, lot better.",

    "text": "STBXH is dating our former marriage counselor. I'm embarrassed and can't deal. I don't want to make this a rambling post.  But I need to vent and this is the only place I can go. I have no idea what to do.\n\nSo ex and I decided to end it about a year ago, after three long years of struggling, counseling, him moving out then back in, finally him filling and me moving out.\n\nWe've both dated and tried to find happiness since then. I am at peace with our decision, my relationship with our kids is fantastic, I just want everyone to be happy. Let me make a side note that at one point I was dating a transgender male which he found out about and made my life hell for a few months but that eventually died down. \n\nOk fast forward to a week ago. My kids start to complain about his new gf. I tell them that their daddy loves them, but he deserves to be happy. They tell me it's our former marriage counselor. Record screech.   The same women I went one on one to. Whom I told my darkest secrets to. Whom my kids went to when we split.  (Obviously I stopped seeing her at some point, but he didn't)\n\nI'm a professor. I've taken and taught psychology courses. I can't process this. I'm not jealous. I feel betrayed. I go by my old house and I see that she's decorating the lions on my old steps. Her dog is chilling in the living room. All after I told her the turmoils of our marriage. The personals of my life.\n\nPeople are telling me to report her but I want to text her. Yell at her. Act like a crazy person. All of the anger I've been tempering through bettering myself is boiling beneath my chest. I don't want to see another counselor. I'm not even mad at him. I know he has no regard for how I feel. But this woman took an oath. And she broke it for my dirty past. I bet they giggle at night in my old bed about how clever they are. \n\nI can't vent to my friends. It's embarrassing. It's rude to bring this up to my current bf (who is wonderful btw). I know I have to find inner peace. But every time I think about the lions I used to love with fucking bows on their necks, I internally rage. \n\nOk I'm a liar. This is long as hell. Help please.\n\nEdit: forgot the detail that she has a husband. And they also own a gun shop together. And in the back of that gun shop is where her counseling office is. I once posted a shotgun toilet plunger that she had in the bathroom (in another sub).\n\nEdit2: thank you for the overwhelming support! It means so much. I'm going to talk to my lawyer and then look at the options for reporting her. I don't want to destroy her, but standing by and doing nothing would mean I'm being compliant to this unethical behavior. \n\nAnd also, I'm pretty shocked at how many people accused me if being jealous and vindictive, and then straight up defended the actions of the counselor. It bottles my mind how anyone can think this is normal, ethical behavior.",

    "text": "Well, That was Rough. Yup. Thankfully (and maybe less-thankfully, because it'll set this class back again) I'm on Spring Break right now. \n\nSo on Monday I did a circle, and [Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/bbpnv7/well_not_what_i_intended_but_ill_take_it_i_guess/) I had half the class skip. \n\nFriday I had nearly full attendance. Only one out was my Ghost Child (one of the kids on my roster but only shows up once a month at most.) I was dreading it so much, especially because I had a migraine. I would have gone home but, seeing as it was the day before Spring Break, there would have been no coverage. I was mostly functional, but emotional, but even totally-on-top-of-my-game the cards would fall here. On top of that, my girlfriend and I were having an argument over text that had started that morning. (Yes, I ignored my phone during class, just making sure that's out there.) So I was already upset to begin with.\n\nI gotta give them this: they were trying. They really were. \n\nUsually I take about 5 kids to lunch. I should take 7. All 7 showed up. One swept my room?? Another asked for permission before he opened my windows. I stressed that they came back on time; the principal was still interested in who hadn't. (I had talked to him about a few of my Lunch Crew disappearing after lunch to see if there was a staff member who could walk my class back. Most teachers do pick up their students from the lunch room, but I can't as I have a split-lunch class. Lunch ends at 1.25, and I get kids in the room around 1.17.)\n\nThey all sat in their assigned seats with minor kvetching. You know that \"oh, I've made a horrible mistake\" feeling you get when you've made a bad seating chart? Yeah. I made a horrible mistake. I had a cluster of bad behavior right in front of me. 3 students were late, but they had been skipping yesterday, so this was an improvement. (Dishearteningly, I had called down to the office to ask for an all-call, and the secretary wrote down the names but didn't call for them to come to my class.)\n\nWe actually do independent reading somewhat successfully, and one of my stressors, the one-on-one para, was very helpful here. (She is so, so very sweet to me, but has about five rants she cycles through with varying levels of paranoia laced in. She once told me the district sent spies in disguised as subs to find reasons to fire people. Yeah.) Independent reading is always the hard part, but I think knowing that the kids who behave themselves got computers last independent reading really helped the behavior.\n\nThen I have them transition to their workbooks. Just as we do this, the vision specialist walks in. Well. Thank fuck I've got this girl close to the board (I'm putting her closer next time--I had placed her one row back to minimize travel distance from the door, but once she's seated it would be best if she were right up front) and copies of the textbook printed out big for her. The woman sets up in Ghost Girl's seat and I start the lesson.\n\nWell. I try. For about twenty minutes. I lose my temper. I snap at them. One of the kids I've had the whole year starts nervous-laughing. He's seen me upset, but he probably hadn't seen me *this* upset. One of the kids begs to go to the bathroom, insisting he can't hold it. \n\nThe whole time I'm aware the vision specialist is still watching. I imagine she's having the same sort of feelings I am over this: how much of a shame it is that four kids are spoiling the class for everyone else. And maybe she's also feeling like I'm a bad teacher.\n\nThe kid comes back from the bathroom and says he wants to talk to me after class. I manage to teach for about 15 minutes without interruptions. (Success!)\n\nI find out the kid who left went to the head of the SPED department, whose office is right across the way from my room. He told me after class that he told her I was trying very hard, but there were kids in the room that were making it difficult for him to learn and he *really wanted to learn.* He said she'd call me after class but she didn't. I praised him going to stand up for himself and his classmates, telling him that it's always the right thing to get another adult if he needs help. We'll speak after break, but I'm not sure there's really anything she can do. \n\nHe had done this before the climax of the class, where x and y started throwing books at each-other.\n\nEvery time I turned my back to write on the board I'd hear a book drop, and I'd even catch books flying out of the corner of my eye. So I stop the lesson again. Once I trust they don't have any more books, I try and start again and I see y throw a book at x, but hit z. In the face. In the nose/eye area.\n\nZ's mother's hobby is to threaten the school with lawyers. And he just got hurt. In my class. Fuuuuck me. He's telling me it was really hurting. The kids insist the 7th grade level admin is out, and I know the 8th grade and 6th grade admins are rarely in their offices as they're usually observing teachers, handling students, and patrolling the hallways. I write the student a pass to the office and tell him to tell them to call the 8th or 6th grade admin over so he could talk to them. If he needs ice, the office will get him that, too. And to bring his stuff, because we had 2 minutes of class left at this point.\n\nI wrote the kids up and made the phone calls after school. It kills me to do that for x, because I think things aren't right at home, but I have absolutely zero proof beyond his performing major anxiety over the idea of getting in trouble, so I treat him like any other kid. I debate calling Z's mother to explain what had happened and that I took it seriously to try and do preemptive damage control, but decide that I have paperwork to prove that I took it seriously and her kid will likely add in the detail that I sent him to the office. \n\nI need this spring break so bad. I also need a seating chart and some sort of xanax-distribution-mister or something.",

    "text": "How to prepare for an interview with Aptean? Background: I‚Äôm a 24 yo college graduate who is currently working part time in a restaurant because that was all I could find without any work experience. Now that I have work experience, I‚Äôve been looking for a full time job in an office that would allow me to move out of my parents‚Äô house and live with my boyfriend. My degree is in Criminal Justice and I‚Äôm not looking to be a cop. I would like to have a normal life working in a office and therefore, I‚Äôve been applying to entry level office jobs in claims (my mom‚Äôs an in house lawyer for a insurance company and I‚Äôve always been fantasied by her work.) and other jobs.\n\nStory: I applied for a entry level Talent Acquisition Specialist at Aptean and was excited when I heard back for a request to take an assessment for the job. I took that. I must‚Äôve passed because after I took it, I got a request to schedule a phone interview. The day of the phone interview comes. The woman who scheduled the phone interview calls me and tells me that they already filled the position I applied for (the posting was only up for a couple of days when I applied. So I find it quite weird that they filled it pretty quickly.), but she wanted to talk to me about a receptionist position that was open. \n\nI do not have any receptionist or office admin experience (I looked at the posting and it said they wanted 1 year of receptionist experience. So I don‚Äôt know why she would interview me for something that I don‚Äôt have any experience in it.), but I do have Customer Service Experience from working in a restaurant, I‚Äôm pretty tech savvy and I know I could do this job pretty easily if given the chance. Therefore, I said sure and she interviewed me over the phone for the position. It went really well and she had me retake the assessment over webcam (I guess to make sure I hadn‚Äôt cheated the first time). Again, I must‚Äôve passed it because she emailed after the assessment to schedule an in-person interview with the hiring manager.\n\nWe scheduled it for Monday the 11th (which is tomorrow at the time of this posting) at 10:30 am. I‚Äôm excited for this interview and really don‚Äôt want to mess it up. Is there anything I should do to prep for this interview tomorrow? And could anyone give insight into why she would want me to interview for a position that I don‚Äôt have any experience in? \n\nThanks in advance!",

    "text": "[x-post from r/Scams] I'm caught up in a possible scam or fraudulent situation involving recruiters in the tech industry. Reddit, I need your insight and advice. [Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/bk1b4y/im_caught_up_in_a_possible_scam_or_fraudulent/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nI'm a tech professional who's spent a fair amount of time in the job market. After I left my previous job I felt that I needed time for some life maintenance, so I did not jump immediately back into the job market. Within weeks, several recruiters began to contact me. I left the door open to possibility and decided to entertain their offers.\n\nSince that time here's what's happened:\n\nRecruitment Company A contacts me via LinkedIn. One thing leads to another, they \"interviewed\" me internally over the phone and Skype and none of the opportunities materialize. Then I'm led to another \"opportunity\" that requires my ssn to apply. At this point I declined, stating that maybe if this were a government job I would understand the need for an ssn, and then the line with this company goes dead.\n\nFast forward about a month. Local Recruitment Company B, among others, contacts me with a job offer that sounds very provocative. Everything seems normal over the course of several conversations, up until the point before we begin talking about interviews for the job, and I'm presented with an online skills assessment test (I'll call it the Mystery Test), and from a then-unknown third party company. I'm told I cannot even proceed with further steps with the supposed client until I take the Mystery Test. I've done similar things before, but I want to prepare, so I begin doing research on the Mystery Test. All I can find on it are a few posts on Reddit with mixed results (some did well, some did not). It's an adaptive test that's designed to get harder as the test progresses, and there's no way to ascertain the amount of material that may be covered, nor is there any way to practice or prepare for the test. So basically this recruiter is asking me to undress and expose myself for inspection, in a sense, and trust them with the use of whatever information this test produces. I talked to my lawyer about my concerns who advised me to not take it, and I contacted Recruitment Company B about my concerns on the grounds that this assessment is not an industry standard and could be materially harmful in the wrong hands, and I asked for alternatives. None were given and I declined the opportunity. Suddenly the line went dead among three recruiters who I had been in contact with at that time.\n\nFast forward another month or so. Recruitment Company A contacts me again, over the phone this time, but it's a different recruiter. She has an amazing job opportunity, something that really appeals to me. It's a contract-to-hire government job with the state (it didn't dawn on me until later that I had mentioned government work with this company the first time). She forwards me to a \"manager\" for further questioning. This manager interviews me shortly, and notifies me that she is going to email me a skills test and such. Not long afterward, LinkedIn pings me with a contact request from this woman. I received the test in email, and it's the same Mystery Test sent to me by Recruitment Company B. I am immediately suspicious at this point, I searched for this job opportunity through the state's website, but found nothing, so I called around. I'm still waiting for confirmation from the Technology Management & Budgeting department, but I was first forwarded up to a Civil Services Commission who informed me that the state does not work with third-party recruiters, and that they use their own resources.\n\nApparently something highly suspicious may be happening here. A few years ago I almost fell victim to a fraudulent company praying on tech job seekers. There may not be a connection, but I at least have reason to be worried about malicious tactics out there.\n\nReddit, I need any insight, advice or information that you have about what may be going on, or about what to do. Thanks. \n\nEdit: I'm not sure why people are hung up on the test itself, but since there are so many questions about it [here is some info](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/37ks28/am_i_just_dumb_for_doing_this_badly_on_the_ikm/) on the actual test. It's not for Java only, and can be configured to test on different subjects. Again, it's an adaptive test that is basically designed to find out what you fail at, so if you aren't 100% perfect at the given subject matter it almost seems guaranteed to come up with info on your flaws as a coder.\n\nAgain, it's not that this test is harmful in and of itself, but there are other things going on here, like a lie about a job opportunity, and multiple, supposedly locally based recruiting companies who appear to be working together in some way, and I want to know what their motivations are.\n\nEdit2: I did a little more digging on the exam. I found a [data sheet](https://www.ikmnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IKM-Report-Analysis.pdf) that states the following:\n\n>*All information generated throughout the assessment process is stored in a secure IKM HID‚Ñ¢ (Human Intelligence Database) for future use, whether its for training, recruitment or other HR initiatives. You may produce reports for additional analysis at any level, including individual, project team, departmental or enterprise-wide. You can even compare results to the entire IKM assessment-taker population for industry standard benchmarking.*\n\nSo apparently if you take this test your info goes into a database that can be accessed by many prospective employers.",

But I think there are important lessons to be learned and important signals to recognize. \n\nI worked as a civil rights litigation/criminal law paralegal for 10 years before I made the outstanding move of going to law school. I know firsthand how completely overwhelming practicing law can be. You (sometimes literally) have a person's life in your hands. There is a huge workload and bigger expectations. Perfection is expected and often thrust on you. Deadlines constantly (CONSTANTLY) loom and there are times that you feel perennially under the gun.  Attorney suicide (and law school student suicide) are very real issues. \n\nI've been working 20 hours a week through my first year because of my unique financial status, and there are times where it feels like I am barely keeping myself afloat psychologically. It's a good reminder that when you are freaking out, feeling overwhelmed, and underwater that maybe you need to take a moment for yourself. Unplug, even if just for a few hours. I know this is difficult advice for those studying for the bar. But lawyer suicides are increasing, and its surprisingly easy to find yourself in a dark place. My school has free counseling and support services offered 24 hours a day. I'm sure most schools do too. There is no shame in reaching out and asking for help.\n\nWith that said,  if you or someone you know is depressed and in need help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline ([1-800-273-8255](http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/))",

    "text": "[Texas] Anybody have any experience with probationary licensing process and obtaining hearings before BLE (or other states' equivalent)? I ask because of the following:\n\n1) a friend got a class-B misdemeanor DWI back in February of 2018.  Then they graduated from law school in May 2018.  Completed their application for a law license and took the bar in July 2018.  Passed the bar.  Their DWI was fully adjudicated back in November of 2018 and they were ordered to do like 60 hours of community service and 6 months probation.\n\n2) my friend retained counsel for the purpose of getting them through the BLE's necessary application hearing.  As I understand it, the law states that when a student who has passed all other requirements for license gets a DWI, they are at least entitled to a probationary law license and a hearing on whether they should have full confirmation (or continue w/ probation).  Maybe someone who knows more about this can correct me as I'm getting all this from my friend.\n\n3) This attorney has taken over $7000 of my friend's money and is asking for more now... but it's now almost June 2019 and my friend **still hasn't been given a probationary license OR had a hearing set in front of the BLE**.   This woman specializes in the bar application process, so at least getting an initial hearing within a year of having been retained should be her fucking bread and butter and not cost more than $7000.  And I also have ethical questions pertaining to what she's been reporting to the BLE (but that's for another post).\n\nMy friend's also getting very worried because their passing bar exam score is only good for 2 years and it just doesn't look like the BLE ever intends to set a hearing.\n\nThe attorney's explanation is \"well the BLE sets its own docket and may have a full docket\"... but I *personally*, in my experience as a lawyer, have never seen any court or any administrative panel *so* backed up that you can't get a hearing in less than 7 months (Nov. 2018 is when my friend satisfied all the BLE's prerequisites for obtaining the probationary license and hearing).\n\n\nIs this experience par for the course?  Or is something not passing the smell test here?  I ask because hearing her describe it, it sounds like all these fucking civil-side attorneys that take the students through the licensing process, the criminal attorneys they refer the students to for the DWI, the BLE officers, the psychologists giving the required evaluations, etc., are all part of a little referral club, they're all friends, nobody wants to upset anybody, and they all have a cushy little racket taking money from desperate law grads and fucking them around forever.\n\nThat's *my* personal take.  I'd like to hear from others though who went through the process.",

    "text": "Lost my job because I was targeted for being a white male I'm a 33 year old white male, and I am a mental health counsellor. I worked on a team with 4 other females, all counsellors/social workers/etc. On that team was a 23 year old who made her opinions about men very clear. Back in August she presented my manager with a list of things that I had said that offended her. I had no idea I was saying anything that offended her. There was about 6 things on this list, and many of them were just me expressing a different opinion than her. It was certainly never my intention to offend anyone with these opinions, and they weren't racist or sexist or derogatory. I've shown this list to many people, including many women, some of whom said they disagreed with some of my opinions, but none said they were worth complaining about. What's worse is this individual took the things I said, and twisted them, either misquoting them or taking them completely out of context, to make me look a certain way. I don't think she did this intentionally, I do believe this is what she heard me say as my words went through her filter. \n\nShe took it to the manager, who is a female and has also demonstrated having a negative bias towards men. For this reason, I was not offered the chance to tell my side of the story; I was ignored when pointing out that I didn't say these things the way she is saying I did. I was offended, and pointed out to my manager that other people on the team, including the woman who presented this list and my manager herself, have made comments that I could have complained about should I have wanted to. My manager has also commented on my appearance more than once, which is sexual harassment, and I reminded her of this (although I didn't put it that way). I stated that I felt this was incredibly hypocritical, but it didn't matter; I was sent to anti-racism anti-oppression training, one-on-one with a trainer chosen by my manager. I showed him the list, told him my side, and he said, in his professional opinion of doing this for 20+ years, that he felt I'm being singled out and I'm being sent to this training to be \"fixed\" so I'll go back to work, shut my mouth and be quiet. He believed this was a team issue being turned into a me issue, and I agreed. This was in September. In November we met with this trainer as a team. It was uncomfortable. I expressed my fear of sharing an opinion that someone disagrees with lest it be held against me at a later time. But we did the training, and things went back to normal. My working relationship with this young woman was never the same, but it was civil. \n\nFlash forward 3 months, when I am sitting in my office waiting for my first client of the day, and my manager and an hr rep entered my office and told me I am being let go because I \"don't fit in\" and that my \"views are better suited elsewhere.\" It was out of nowhere. I had been so careful with everything I had said since August. I received no warning, no investigation, no opportunity to fight for my job. It was decided.\n\nI have dedicated my life to helping others. I do not discriminate against anyone, quite the opposite in fact. I help individuals of all genders, sexual orientations, races, religions, ethnicities, ages and so on. I help many people who have been discriminated against, oppressed, or stigmatized. But I was on a team with a 23 year old female who only ever saw me as a white male, and she targeted me, and she was successful. She has had an impact on me financially, on my career, and a severe impact on my mental health. I hate her, and I hate my biased manager who handled the situation different than she would have if the roles were reversed. This is a scary time.\n\nEdit: I should have mentioned I consulted an employment lawyer. He is a friend of a friend, so I trust him and his advice. He said that although I likely have a case of discrimination, he strongly suggested I don't take legal action on the basis of discrimination, due to the fact that I am straight, white and male. He said that win or lose the case, it would reflect bad on me, particularly in the field that I work in.\n\nThe list:\n-age (she was the youngest on the team by 10 years. Myself, and the rest of the team, would occasionally playfully tease her about her age. I never once put her down because of it. At a team meeting she asked all of us to stop it, and I know I did. And yet, it still made the list) -he said that questions about power and privilege on interviews are useless (in fact, I said \"I didn't see the point\" but I was referring to one specific case, but that's a whole other story. But she generalized it, and that was not my intention or meaning nor my words) - mat leave (the women on the team were having a conversation about how the US was cutting parental leave time and were talking about how sexist it is. I said I don't think it's fair to call it sexist because, although it disproportionately affects women, it affects all genders who would take parental leave) -said he wanted another male on the team; \"there are too many of you and only one of me\" (at a team meeting we were talking about hiring a new person for the team, I suggested we consider hiring another male as some clients request male counsellors specifically and because I felt it might add some more diversity to the team. I was often shut down very quickly if the women on the team did not agree with my opinion. I certainly did not say the words she put in quotation marks) -you look nice (said to her ONE TIME in the year I worked with her before she gave this list, because she got dressed up for a presentation and I was just trying to be nice. I didn't think anything of it. I certainly wasn't hitting on her or flirting with her, and again, it was a one time occurence)\n-he is aggressive when his point is not agreed with and does not take into account other people's feelings (in fact, I would often be shown aggression from the females on my team. When I suggested hiring another male, the 23 year old snapped at me \"you can't say that!!\" and she clearly did not take into account my feelings. But of course that doesn't go both ways)",

    "text": "Feminists say that there is no sexism against men, because men don't suffer institutional discrimination. In fact is males, rather than females, who suffer the vast majority of institutional discrimination. This post was originally submitted by u/Vwar. For new subscribers, here it is again. Indeed, the fact of institutional discrimination against men must be repeated again and again until it is realised by all.\n\n---\n\nI don't believe that males have ever been \\[privileged\\]([https://www.amazon.ca/Privileged-Sex-Martin-van-Creveld/dp/1484983122](https://www.amazon.ca/Privileged-Sex-Martin-van-Creveld/dp/1484983122)) in the way feminists claim.   But we are now at the point where the deck is stacked against males at every stage of their lives and in almost every major institution.   \n\nWhen a male is born he can have his genitals mutilated. Hundreds of baby boys die from this procedure every year.\n\nThen comes primary school, where boys are often punished and even drugged for displaying natural boyish behavior. Recent studies have also revealed that female teachers mark down boys by an average of 20 percent for the same work.\n\nHuge numbers of boys are now being raised without fathers (including about 99 percent of school shooters, funny how we never talk about that), and since pedo hysteria has chased male teachers out of primary school, boys often don't have any male role models until much later in life.\n\nBoys only clubs (eg the Boy Scouts) are being eliminated while girl only clubs remain.\n\nTeenage boys are being introduced to blatantly misandrist concepts like \"toxic masculinity,\" with narry a word about toxic femininity and nothing about the positive aspects of masculinity.\n\nNext it's off to University, where there are a range of female-specific scholarships and programs even though women make up the majority of college students and young women are now out-earning young men. They are also portrayed as rapists in waiting, and there are entire departments (gender studies) devoted to demonizing their sex. If a young man pisses off a young woman (eg dumps her after a one night stand) he faces the possibility of being subjected to a false accusation and a feminist Kangaroo court. Then it's bye bye academic career and social reputation.\n\nIf he wants to vote he will have to sign over his body to the state (selective service).\n\nIf he gets a woman pregnant he will not have the option of legal parental surrender. While a woman can just drop off the baby at a safe haven, the man is on the hook for 18 years of child support and will be locked up if he loses his job and can't pay.\n\nIn the workplace things are just as bad. Men perform almost all of the dirty and dangerous jobs and make up 95 percent of workplace injuries and deaths. If a white man wants to pursue a more respected career he faces racial and sexual discrimination in hiring due to corporate \"diversity\" measures and quotas. A recent study in...I think it was Australia found that \"blind hiring\" practices (where the employer doesn't know the race or sex of the applicant) result in more straight white males being hired; this means that it is straight white men who are now suffering discrimination in the workplace.\n\nWith MeToo, a man can be fired from his job simply for making a woman uncomfortable. There have even been cases of men being fired for telling a naughty joke.\n\nIf he gets married and the wife divorces him through no fault of his own he will likely be treated like shit by the family courts unless he can afford a high priced lawyer. There are countless stories of men effectively being turned into indentured servants by their ex-wives; they live in poverty and seldom see their kids while the wife gets a new \"baby daddy\" and lives high on the hog. NOW, the largest feminist organization in the world, continues to oppose shared parenting even though every single study shows it to be in the best interests of the children, the father and even the mother.\n\nHe will receive less social support, less health care spending, and be relentlessly demonized in the media. \n\nIf a male is sexually assaulted by a woman he will probably not receive justice; the perp will likely get a slap on the wrist even if the victim is a boy.  \n\nIf he commits a crime or is falsely accused of a crime he will be treated much, much more harshly by the criminal justice system.\n\nI could go on.\n\nIt is a myth that feminists think the sexes are equal. Their MO goes like this: if men are ahead in some area, that means women are being oppressed because the sexes are identical except for genitalia; however, if women are ahead in some area that's because women are superior. You can find this sentiment going back to the first wave. Elizabeth Cady Stanton claimed that women are \"infinitely superior\" to men.\n\nThe prison thing is perhaps the most glaring example of feminists not practicing what they preach. If they were serious about equality they would be demanding either that men be treated with more compassion/leniency or that women be treated more harshly (or some combination of the two). Instead, they want women to be treated even \\*more\\* leniently, and some are even advocating for the complete abolition of female prisons.\n\nMen are increasingly second class citizens not only in a social but legal sense. A study in the UK determined that if women were treated like men by the criminal justice system, fully half of all prisoners would be female. Women do NOT commit less crimes than men (though they do commit less homicides), they just don't get punished to anywhere near the same extent.\n\nIf feminism were an \"equality\" movement they would not be trying to privilege females in every single institution.    They would be looking with a keen eye at areas in which males are disadvantaged and/or subject to institutional discrimination.   They certainly wouldn't blame everything on some nebulous all-encompassing \"patriarchy\" that hasn't even been proven to exist.  \n\nAdvocates of gender equality must reject feminism, and support men's rights.",

    "text": "A response to a post on r/Feminism Earlier today, I made a crosspost in r/MensRights linking to a post from r/Feminism which had the following text:\n\n>Alot of the times when I see people talk about male rape or DV victims it's usually in the context of a woman talking about her experience with rape or DV, and it's usually like this: Commentor: \"Men FACE this kind of ABUSE everyday but SOCIETY only cares about WOMEN\"  \n>  \n>First of all that's not true. Despite the huge amounts of awareness, domestic violence against women is still a problem. Bisexual women are the group most likely to face domestic violence and women are more likely to experience abuse then men. Women are also more likely to be sexually abused, harassed, and even raped then men, so that is the primary reason female victims get more awareness, and also some time ago people would even encourage men to beat their female partners to 'keep them in line', it is not common to hear someone say that a woman should abuse her male partner to 'keep them in line', so that is the primary reason women victims get more awareness then men. Still, male victims do need help, shelter, and support, and also awareness. However, I think the biggest problem plaguing them is toxic masculinity. According to toxic masculinity, men are stronger and smarter then women so they can never be victims, but we know better. Men and women are equal, so in a hetero relationship a man can certainly be a victim. According to toxic masculinity, sex is one of the most valuable thing to a man that a woman can give him, so rape is impossible, but rape is possible, and atleast 1 in 75 men will be raped in their lifetime. Due to this, male victims are often shamed, especially by sexist men (Donald Trump and Sean Hannity once did this to a 14 year old who had been raped by his teacher) So in short, toxic masculinity harms male victims.  \n>  \n>But what saddens me is that many people, anti feminists and MRAs especially who dont give a shit about male victims will try to use them as a weapon against feminism, or just women in general. It's sickening, we can help victims of both genders, and non-binary victims as well, without 'competing' to see who is more oppressed.\n\nI provided a thorough rebuttal, with links to sources, in the comments of my crosspost in r/MensRights that linked to the r/Feminism post, but that post was removed by the moderators of this sub I assume because a mod thought I was encouraging brigading (I have since deleted it, since no one else will see it anyway). So I'll provide my responses here, and I'll neglect to provide the link to the original post in r/Feminism like my original post here did.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, let's tear down this feminist's ideas.\n\n>Alot of the times when I see people talk about male rape or DV victims it's usually in the context of a woman talking about her experience with rape or DV, and it's usually like this: Commentor: \"Men FACE this kind of ABUSE everyday but SOCIETY only cares about WOMEN\" First of all that's not true.  \n>  \n>Despite the huge amounts of awareness, domestic violence against women is still a problem. Bisexual women are the group most likely to face domestic violence and women are more likely to experience abuse then men.\n\nBefore you go any further with this, the research has shown gender symmetry in domestic violence. Approximately half of domestic violence is reciprocal violence where both partners abuse each other, and women are more likely to initiate this kind of violence. And in cases of non-reciprocal violence where the violence is unilaterally perpetrated by one partner against the other, female violence towards men is actually more common than male violence against women.\n\nHere is the LARGEST set of meta analyses on domestic violence by The Partner Abuse State of Knowledge Project (PASK). Researchers were asked to conduct a formal search for published, peer-reviewed studies through standard, widely-used search programs, and then catalogue and summarize all known research studies relevant to each major topic and its sub-topics. Approximately 12,000 studies were considered and more than 1,700 were summarized and organized into tables.\n\nThe key findings were:\n\n* Among large population samples, 57.9% of IPV reported was bi-directional, 42% unidirectional; 13.8% of the unidirectional violence was male to female (MFPV), 28.3% was female to male (FMPV)\n* Among school and college samples, percentage of¬†bidirectional violence was 51.9%; 16.2% was MFPV and 31.9% was FMPV\n\nAnd before you say that even though women initiate violence more than men do in relationships, that women are still more often the victims of partner violence because their reasons for hitting are different than men's - I direct you to these quotes from my source:\n\n* Male and female IPV perpetrated from similar motives ‚Äì primarily to get back at a partner for emotionally hurting them, because of stress or jealousy, to express anger and other feelings that they could not put into words or communicate, and to get their partner‚Äôs attention.\n* Eight studies directly compared men and women in the power/control motive and subjected their findings to statistical analyses. Three reported no significant gender differences and one had mixed findings. One paper found that women were more motivated to perpetrate violence as a result of power/control than were men, and three found that men were more motivated; however, gender differences were weak\n\n[https://domesticviolenceresearch.org](https://domesticviolenceresearch.org/)\n\nOh, and before you say some shit like \"Okay, female-on-male violence may be just as common if not more common than male-on-female violence, but women are still FAR more likely to be seriously injured by DV\" yeah no. The gender gap regarding harm and injury isn't nearly as big as you seem to think it is. IIRC statistically for every 8 women seriously injured by DV (injured seriously enough to require emergency medical attention), 5 men are. That's not nearly as big a gap as most people assume.\n\nThere are also some studies which show that men are actually *more* often injured by DV. A 2001 study called \"Physical aggression in a community sample of at-risk young couples: gender comparisons for high frequency, injury, and fear.\" indicated that 9.4% of men and 13.2% of women perpetrated frequent physical aggression toward their partners.¬†Contrary to expectations, 13% of men and 9% of women, indicated that they were physically injured at least once.¬†The authors reported \"2% of the men and none of the women indicate that they had been hurt by their partners between five and nine times.\"\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11584793](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11584793)\n\nA study called \"Partner Violence and Mental Health Outcomes in a New Zealand Birth Cohort\" revealed that men and women reported similar rates of injury (3.9% for women vs. 3.3% for men).¬†In the words of the authors: \"The consequences of domestic violence in terms of injury and psychological effects were similar for both men and women.\"\n\n[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00202.x](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00202.x)\n\n[https://sci-hub.shop/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00202.x](https://sci-hub.shop/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2005.00202.x)\n\nFurthermore, meta analyses have shown that the primary predictor of serious domestic violence injury in women is their own initiation of violence. Basically, you're more likely to be injured as a woman if the man is hitting you back. As said earlier, a huge amount (approximately half) of domestic violence is reciprocal, and it is more likely to be initiated by women. A large percentage of reciprocal violence involves the female partner assaulting and emotionally abusing the male partner until he snaps and reacts violently.\n\nMaybe if we want injury of women to come down, we should teach women not to initiate in the first place? Just a thought.\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223225227\\_Intimate\\_partner\\_physical\\_abuse\\_perpetration\\_and\\_victimization\\_risk\\_factors\\_A\\_meta-analytic\\_review](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223225227_Intimate_partner_physical_abuse_perpetration_and_victimization_risk_factors_A_meta-analytic_review)\n\n>Women are also more likely to be sexually abused, harassed, and even raped then men, so that is the primary reason female victims get more awareness\n\nAgain, go look at the data. Look at the CDC's NISVS. In the 2010 and 2011 reports just as many men reported having been subjected to nonconsensual sexual intercourse in the previous 12 months. In the 2012 report more men than women reported having been subjected to nonconsensual sexual intercourse in the previous 12 months.\n\nIt may not look immediately obvious, because they introduce their reports with findings such as these:\n\nNISVS 2010:\n\n\"Nearly 1 in 5 women (18.3%) and 1 in 71 men (1.4%) in the United States have been raped at some time in their lives, including completed forced penetration, attempted forced penetration, or alcohol/drug facilitated completed penetration.\"\n\nNISVS 2011:\n\n\"In the United States, an estimated 19.3% of women and 1.7% of men have been raped during their lifetimes; an estimated 1.6% of women reported that they were raped in the 12 months preceding the survey. The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.\"\n\nHowever, the rape numbers in these studies do not cover all victims of nonconsensual sex, they only cover victims who were forcibly penetrated by a perpetrator. If a man was forced to penetrate a perpetrator, this would not be considered as rape and it would instead fall into a separate category \"made to penetrate\".\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs\\_report2010-a.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf)\n\n*Rape is defined as any completed or attempted unwanted vaginal (for women), oral, or anal penetration through the use of physical force (such as being pinned or held down, or by the use of violence) or threats to physically harm and includes times when the victim was drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent.*\n\n*Rape is separated into three types, completed forced penetration, attempted forced penetration, and completed alcohol or drug facilitated penetration.*\n\n*Among women, rape includes vaginal, oral, or anal penetration by a male using his penis.It also includes vaginal or anal penetration by a male or female using their fingers or an object.* ¬†\n\n*Among men, rape includes oral or anal penetration by a male using his penis. It also includes anal penetration by a male or female using their fingers or an object.*\n\n*Being made to penetrate someone else includes times when the victim was made to,or there was an attempt to make them, sexually penetrate someone without the victim‚Äôs consent because the victim was physically forced (such as being pinned or held down, or by the use of violence) or threatened with physical harm, or when the victim was drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent.* ¬†\n\n*Among women, this behavior reflects a female being made to orally penetrate another female‚Äôs vagina or anus.*\n\n*Among men, being made to penetrate someone else could have occurred in multiple ways: being made to vaginally penetrate a female using one‚Äôs own penis; orally penetrating a female‚Äôs vagina or anus; anally penetrating a male or female; or being made to receive oral sex from a male or female. It also includes female perpetrators attempting to force male victims to penetrate them, though it did not happen.*\n\nESSENTIALLY: under the NISVS' methodologies a woman drugging and riding a man would not be counted as rape. The numbers for men who have been raped only refer to men who were penetrated, for example men who have been forced into anal sex or made to perform oral sex on another man. And yes, situations like these are comparatively rare.\n\nMen being forced to penetrate a perpetrator, on the other hand, is much more common, but it is not included as rape and instead gets considered as \"made to penetrate\". Made to penetrate falls into the category \"other sexual violence\" with other vastly less severe forms of sexual violence and harassment such as \"non-contact unwanted sexual experiences\".\n\nHowever, since the CDC gathered the data for \"made to penetrate\", that allows us to make comparisons. One-year prevalence is considered to be more accurate than lifetime rates because they do not depend on recall of events long past, and therefore we will be using these numbers to analyse the 2010, 2011, and 2012 NISVS studies. In each of these years, when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being ‚Äúmade to penetrate‚Äù -either by physical force or due to intoxication - at virtually the same rates as women reported rape.\n\nNISVS 2010 showed that in the past 12 months, 1.1% of men (or an estimated 1,267,000 men) were made to penetrate and 1.1% of women (or an estimated 1,270,000 women) were raped.\n\nNISVS 2011 showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men (or an estimated 1,921,000 men) were made to penetrate and 1.6% of women (or an estimated 1,929,000 women) were raped.\n\nNISVS 2012 showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men (or an estimated 1,957,000 men) were made to penetrate and 1.0% of women (or an estimated 1,217,000 women) were raped.\n\nIn each of the years the case count for male rape victims and female victims of made-to-penetrate were too small to provide a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.\n\nHere is a table [(source)](https://recalculatingthegenderwar.tumblr.com/post/162336650896/new-cdc-data-again-finds-as-many-if-not-more) to easily demonstrate it.\n\nCDC NISVS Yearly Rape and Made-To-Penetrate Victimisation\n\n||Rape (women)|Rape (men)|Made to penetrate (women)|Made to penetrate (men)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2010|1.1% (est 1,270,000)|\\*|\\*|1.1% (est 1,267,000)|\n|2011|1.6% (est 1,929,000)|\\*|\\*|1.7% (est 1,921,000)|\n|2012|1.0% (est 1,217,000)|\\*|\\*|1.7% (est 1,957,000)|\n\n^(\\*Zero or statistically insignificant amount according to NISVS)\n\nYou can see that the estimated numbers of male victims of made to penetrate each year look very similar to the estimated numbers of female victims of rape. So if made to penetrate happens about as often as rape each year then by most people's assumed definition of rape (nonconsensual sex) then men are approximately half of rape victims each year.\n\nIn 2010:\n\n1,267,000/2,537,000 = 49.9% of victims of nonconsensual sex in 2010 were men.\n\nIn 2011:\n\n1,921,000/3,850,000 = 49.9% of victims of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were men.\n\nIn 2012:\n\n1,957,000/3,174,000 = 61.7% of victims of nonconsensual sex in 2012 were men.\n\nSo if you're a normal human being who defines rape as simply non-consensual sex instead of solely \"forced penetration of the victim\" like the CDC does then men are half of rape victims. Hmmm.\n\n>and also some time ago people would even encourage men to beat their female partners to 'keep them in line', it is not common to hear someone say that a woman should abuse her male partner to 'keep them in line', so that is the primary reason women victims get more awareness then men.\n\nYou really have a skewed view of the past. Yes, in the past men were allowed to use \"mild correction\" on their wives under the law (as he was socially and legally responsible for the actions of his wife to the extent that he could even be held accountable for the crimes and offences she committed), but he could not beat her black and blue. Men had restrictions on what corporal punishment they could use on their wives.\n\nIn Colonial America, when men went beyond what was legally acceptable, they received punishment through the pillory. ‚ÄúThe pillory was employed for treason, sedition, arson, blasphemy, witchcraft, perjury, wife beating, cheating, forgery, coin clipping, dice cogging, slandering, conjuring, fortune-telling, and drunkenness, among other offences. On several occasions, onlookers pelted the pilloried prisoner so enthusiastically with heavy missiles that death resulted.‚Äù\n\n[https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring03/branks.cfm](https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring03/branks.cfm)\n\nThe whipping post also was a favourite form of punishment for wife-beating. Many examples of vigilante justice, sometimes lethal, enacted against wifebeaters can be found in newspaper clippings from the 1800s and onward, with the full endorsement of society.\n\n[https://unapologeticallyantifeminist.video.blog/2019/05/21/correcting-notions-about-domestic-violence-in-history/](https://unapologeticallyantifeminist.video.blog/2019/05/21/correcting-notions-about-domestic-violence-in-history/)\n\nWe can assume that this was practiced in Europe as well. Likewise, Americans practiced shivaree and Europeans practiced charivari as a way to enable social censure of wife-beaters. Charivari was a historical folk custom expressing public disapproval of personal behaviour, where a mock parade was staged through a community accompanied by a discordant mock serenade. Sometimes the crowd would carry an effigy of the targeted man to a substitute punishment, e.g. burning. Sometimes the man who physically abused his wife would be abused by the community.\n\nThey would chant:\n\n*Old Abram Higback has been paying his good woman; But he neither paid her for what or for why, But he up with his fist and blacked her eye.*\n\n*Now all ye old women, and old women kind, Get together, and be in a mind; Collar him, and take him to the shit-house, And shove him over head.*\n\n*Now if that does not mend his manners, The skin of his arse must go to the tanners; And if that does not mend his manners, Take him and hang him on a nail in Hell.*\n\n*And if the nail happens to crack, Down with your flaps, and at him piss.*\n\nHowever, if a husband was beaten by his wife - the husband, in contrast, was also the subject of the charivari for essentially allowing it to happen. In France about 1400, husbands beaten by their wives were ‚Äúparaded on an ass, face to tail.‚Äù¬† In England, a [mural in Montacute House](https://montacutehouse.blogspot.com/2012/04/skimmington-ride.html) (constructed about 1598) shows a wife beating her husband with a shoe and then a crowd parading the husband on a [cowlstaff](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cowlstaff).¬†\n\nSamuel Pepys recorded in his diary, 10 June 1667: ‚Äúin the afternoon took boat and down to Greenwich, where I find the stairs full of people, there being a great riding there to-day for a man, the constable of the town, whose wife beat him.‚Äù\n\nA Frenchman who traveled in England reported in 1698: \"I have sometimes met in the streets of London a woman carrying a figure of straw representing a man, crown‚Äôd with very ample horns, preceded by a drum, and followed by a mob, making a most grating noise with tongs, grid-irons, frying-pans, and sauce-pans. I asked what was the meaning of all this; they told me that a woman had given her husband a sound beating, for accusing her of making him a cuckold, and that upon such occasions some kind neighbour of the poor innocent injur‚Äôd creature generally performed this ceremony.\"\n\n[https://www.purplemotes.net/2013/01/27/charivari-sex-inequality/](https://www.purplemotes.net/2013/01/27/charivari-sex-inequality/)\n\nHmmm. So while a man could give his wife mild correction under the law, if he went too far with wife-beating the community would frown down upon him and punish him with the pillory, whippings and charivari. THERE WAS NO SUCH EXTREME SOCIAL OR LEGAL CENSURE FOR A WIFE WHO BEAT HER HUSBAND. IF SHE BEAT HIM, HE WAS THE ONE WHO WAS PUNISHED.\n\nThat doesn't sound at all like what you were saying, that wife-beating was considered \"100% okay and encouraged by the community\" whereas husband-beating was condemned.\n\n>Still, male victims do need help, shelter, and support, and also awareness. However, I think the biggest problem plaguing them is toxic masculinity. According to toxic masculinity, men are stronger and smarter then women so they can never be victims, but we know better. Men and women are equal, so in a hetero relationship a man can certainly be a victim.\n\n\"But we know better\" my ass. Feminists have been happy to capitalise on gendered viewpoints of men as strong and oppressive when it suits them, and women as weak, victimised, incapable of causing harm and in need of help and protection. In fact, all they've done is reinforce that viewpoint. Wouldn't you know it, it is not toxic men, but feminists, who have been very happy to paint domestic violence as an issue in which men are the sole perpetrators and women are the sole victims.\n\n**Feminist theories of domestic violence and the Duluth Model**\n\nFeminist theory characterises DV as a sexually directional problem (men abusing women) which is rooted in patriarchal norms of masculine dominance and female subordination. Basically, they theorise that the reason for this gender disparity is that men are socialised in a patriarchal society that makes them feel entitled to have power, dominance and control over women. The earliest batter intervention programs that emerged were based on this feminist theory, that a man needs to control a woman.\n\nLater on, in 1981, when the Duluth Model, a more structured approach to batterer treatment, was created, it was (surprise) also based on this very same feminist idea that domestic violence is a sexually directional problem caused by \"patriarchal terrorism\". In essence, the program attempts to halt men's violent behavior by focusing on the supposed reason they batter: to maintain individual and societal patriarchal dominance. The Duluth Model does not, however, address other possible reasons for violence, including substance abuse problems, psychological problems, violent backgrounds, or unhealthy relationship dynamics. Other common risk factors for violence, such as \"stress on the perpetrator, impulse control problems, trait anger, communication skill deficits, couples' negative interaction, or personality disturbance,\" are systematically excluded as excuses.\n\nAnd under this faulty model, women cannot, as a conceptual matter, perpetrate partner abuse. If they hit their male partners, it was in self defence. If they hit first, or are the only partner who hits, they are doing it within the context of \"violent resistance\" against presumed emotional or psychological abuse on his part. Any violence perpetrated by a woman is dismissed as either non-existent, self-defensive, or insignificant.\n\nThis model is now so widely accepted that it is the most commonly state-mandated model of intervention and is the sole model in the majority of US states and across the English speaking west, despite the statistical evidence contradicting this feminist narrative in a big way. It is the paradigm used to train police, social workers, counsellors, lawyers, judges, medical personnel, guardians ad litem and anyone else who may become involved in a domestic violence case.\n\n[https://honest-ribbon.org/mega-featured/duluth-model-buries-key-facts-on-domestic-violence/](https://honest-ribbon.org/mega-featured/duluth-model-buries-key-facts-on-domestic-violence/)\n\nPart of the reason why this idea has managed to get so much traction is because researchers, activists and reformers who support the idea of gender symmetry and contradict the feminist viewpoint of domestic violence as a sexually directional problem have been ostracised, shamed and silenced for going against the prevailing narrative.\n\nIn 1971, Erin Pizzey opened the world's first DV shelter. She soon realized that most of the women there were as violent as, or more violent than, the men they were fleeing. So she began talking about it, and feminists protested against her. She began to receive regular bomb and death threats. She eventually had to flee England with her children due to all the protests, threats, and violence, and she has said she is banned from the refuge she started.\n\nIn 1977, Suzanne Steinmetz published a book and articles which clearly showed about equal rates of perpetration by males and females. Anger over this resulted in a bomb threat at her daughters‚Äô wedding and she was the object of a letter writing campaign to deny her promotion and tenure at the University of Delaware.\n\nIn 1979, Murray Straus, a family violence researcher was challenged by some colleagues to conduct unbiased research on DV. What he found was gender symmetry in perpetration and victimization. He published his findings, and was subjected to a campaign of threats, blacklisting, shunning, having his grad students' careers sabotaged, etc etc.\n\nThese types of harassment have caused there to be widespread self-censorship by people who fear that contradicting the feminist narrative will negatively affect their prospects.\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228350210\\_Gender\\_symmetry\\_in\\_partner\\_violence\\_The\\_evidence\\_the\\_denial\\_and\\_the\\_implications\\_for\\_primary\\_prevention\\_and\\_treatment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228350210_Gender_symmetry_in_partner_violence_The_evidence_the_denial_and_the_implications_for_primary_prevention_and_treatment)\n\n**Violence Against Women Act**\n\nSo. Radical feminists have fought against acknowledgement of male victims and female perpetrators. They have pushed a faulty model which characterises domestic violence as a primarily or even uniquely male-on-female crime and have described it as patriarchal violence. Even worse, they have attacked and attempted to silence people who have dared to demonstrate gender symmetry in DV - even engaging in acts of terrorism to do so.\n\nAnd they have used this faulty conceptualisation of DV to justify gender-discriminatory legislation. The National Organisation for Women lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male. It was only through a procedural technicality regarding funding and different levels of government taxation that the old law was halted midway through reauthorization, and a new, gender neutral one was introduced. Women's groups, such as the National Organization for Women, fought hard to keep the language in the Act gendered, despite entreaties from LGBTQ groups to reconsider how the language of female victims and male perpetrators failed to serve their community.\n\nAnd even with the gender-neutral version of VAWA that exists now, the Department of Justice‚Äôs Office on Violence Against Women (the principal federal agency that administers VAWA funds) has issued many directives and established funding mechanisms that are openly discriminatory in nature.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/695m34/karen\\_straughans\\_response\\_to\\_those\\_arent\\_real/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&utm\\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/695m34/karen_straughans_response_to_those_arent_real/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n[http://www.saveservices.org/pdf/SAVE-VAWA-Discriminates-Against-Males.pdf](http://www.saveservices.org/pdf/SAVE-VAWA-Discriminates-Against-Males.pdf)\n\n**Predominant Aggressor Policies**\n\nIn the 1980s, there was a call for a vigorous law enforcement response to address the issue of DV, with mandatory arrest laws being instituted in several states. When, however, it was apparent that these same laws led to a large number of dual arrests, and a proportionately greater increase in arrests of women compared to men, feminists started calling for primary aggressor or dominant aggressor laws that told police that instead of arresting both parties, they should just arrest the \"primary aggressor in the relationship\". In determining who the primary aggressor was, they prioritised relative height, weight, strength, AND patriarchal/feminist models of domestic violence (Duluth again), over inconvenient matters such as \"who is the abusive party?\"\n\nThey essentially adjusted policy to make outcomes conform to their theory, rather than adjusting their theory to conform to reality. And the gender ratio in arrests returned to normal - 85% male, at least 1/3 of which would've been victims. How nice.\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233694571\\_In\\_Dubious\\_Battle\\_The\\_Politics\\_of\\_Mandatory\\_Arrest\\_and\\_Dominant\\_Aggressor\\_Laws](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233694571_In_Dubious_Battle_The_Politics_of_Mandatory_Arrest_and_Dominant_Aggressor_Laws)\n\n**The resulting injustice against male victims of abuse**\n\nThese feminist reforms have created a lot of social injustice for male victims of domestic violence. There are many qualitative studies of male helpseekers who reveal that they are turned away, doubted, ridiculed by the formal systems in place that are supposed to prevent DV. Across multiple studies a huge amount of male victims reported being referred to batterers' programs when they called domestic violence hotlines, or arrested by the police who made the false presumption that the man was the primary aggressor. Within the judicial system, some men who sustained DV reported experiencing gender-stereotyped treatment. Even with apparent corroborating evidence that their female partners were violent and that the helpseekers were not, they reportedly lost custody of their children, were blocked from seeing their children, and were falsely accused by their partners of DV and abusing their children.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175099/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175099/)\n\nSo it's feminists that have repeatedly, consistently minimised female-on-male abuse, said that it's SUPER rare and doesn't happen nearly enough for people to care about it (and if it does happen, he was asking for it), shamed and silenced researchers who dared to demonstrate gender symmetry in domestic violence, and used their fucked up worldview to push for law and policy that discriminates against male victims.\n\n>But what saddens me is that many people, anti feminists and MRAs especially who dont give a shit about male victims will try to use them as a weapon against feminism, or just women in general. It's sickening, we can help victims of both genders, and non-binary victims as well, without 'competing' to see who is more oppressed.\n\nYou just, uh, did that in your post. You just competed to see who was more oppressed. You justified the greater awareness and concern for female victims and relative lack of it for male victims by saying \"Women are more likely to be victims of rape and domestic violence than men\" when the statistical evidence actually says otherwise.\n\nAnti-feminists and MRAs that say \"Uh actually, men are very likely to be abused or raped as well\" aren't competing to see who is more oppressed, and they aren't playing Oppression Olympics. We're objecting to YOU feminists playing Oppression Olympics and spreading lies about how women have it so much worse and have always had it so much worse than men to justify unequal treatment when they really don't. Even if you want to help men, you and feminists like you are still lying to us about the nature of the problem, about the nature of society--both pre and post-feminism--and about the nature of men.\n\nAnd as girlwriteswhat says in [this](http://owningyourshit.blogspot.com/2011/09/time-to-set-down-tools.html) blog post: \"while many would insist that any help--even wrongheaded help--is better than none, that if a feminist believes men are \"the minority\" of victims of severe DV still deserve support then we should bring that feminist on board...it just leaves a sour taste in my mouth.\"\n\n\"Because that is not alliance--it's *conditional assistance*, and it is conditional upon them being allowed to go on believing the same lies as before, and spreading them, and feeding the problem even as they're supposedly trying to solve it. And someone who cannot or will not see truth, who is lying even when he believes he's telling the truth, isn't someone you can trust as far as you can throw him.\"\n\nThanks for playing, though.\n\nedit: wording",

    "text": "People constantly overstate the extent to which women were \"oppressed\" in the past. People constantly quote that \"women didn't have the right to own property\", \"women were chattel\", \"women were allowed to be abused, beaten and raped by men\", \"women didn't have the right to vote\", \"women were kept out of male-dominated industries\", \"women were oppressed by men\", etc.\n\nAll this is bullshit.\n\nUnder coverture, single women otherwise known as \"femme sole\" did have the right to own property, had the right to enter into contracts, and overall had the same rights as single men. It was only when they married that they sacrificed some of their rights to own property and enter into contracts on their own.\n\nWhen a woman got married she was considered a \"femme covert\" and her existence was consolidated into that of the man's. People constantly take this to mean that she was chattel, owned by men but this was not the case. Once they were married, women were entitled to be supported and to have the portion that she brought into the marriage managed by their husbands, to the best of their ability. Women had the right to buy necessaries on their husband's credit as their husband's agent. Women could not be prosecuted for most crimes and their husbands would be prosecuted in their stead. Women were immune from liability for debt. They were not in any way chattel, they definitely had less agency, but at the same time they were entitled to protections and privileges and it was considered the man's duty to provide said protections and privileges for them. Women have very frequently sought redress in common law and equity courts when husbands failed in their duties.\n\nMarried women were also not allowed to be abused unlike what people think. The laws allowed for mild correction such as spanking the way you would a child at the time but husbands were not allowed to beat their wives black and blue. A woman could obtain a surety of the peace bond to ensure her safety from a violent husband.\n\n[https://lonang.com/library/reference/blackstone-commentaries-law-england/bla-115/](https://lonang.com/library/reference/blackstone-commentaries-law-england/bla-115/)\n\n[https://www.legalgenealogist.com/2019/02/12/the-defense-of-coverture/](https://www.legalgenealogist.com/2019/02/12/the-defense-of-coverture/)\n\n[https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download\\_file?file\\_format=application/pdf&safe\\_filename=Item.pdf&type\\_of\\_work=Journal%20article](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download_file?file_format=application/pdf&safe_filename=Item.pdf&type_of_work=Journal%20article)\n\nYes, women didn't have the right to vote for most of history, but neither did men. Property owners had the vote, the vast majority of men did not. Male suffrage was something that was fought for, and when men did end up getting the vote before women it wasn't necessarily because of discrimination against women. It was because the vote at the time was seen as a direct extension of men's obligation to be conscripted and fight in war, something which women were not obligated to do.\n\nSomething that makes this even more muddy than it already is is that: the reason why votes for women took so long to be implemented was that the majority of women did not want the vote. There were many anti-suffragette societies, and a fair amount of them were led by women.\n\n[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1910/jul/11/parliamentary-franchise-women-bill](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1910/jul/11/parliamentary-franchise-women-bill)\n\n[https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-history-dept/2015/10/22/450221328/american-women-who-were-anti-suffragettes](https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-history-dept/2015/10/22/450221328/american-women-who-were-anti-suffragettes)\n\n[http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/gilded/power/text12/antisuffrageassoc.pdf](http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/gilded/power/text12/antisuffrageassoc.pdf)\n\nWomen were allowed to work in a lot of male-dominated industries. Guild-type work was always open to single women and windows. In fact there is a lack of evidence of anything preventing women from working. An article (which I've linked below) says:\n\n\"For most girls, becoming a blacksmith was probably not a dream. Husband, family, home: those were the pursuits of a young woman of the eighteenth century. Finding a woman or women working at all outside the home, much less in a male-dominated trade, most likely meant the dream wasn't shaping up the way they'd hoped. Some women worked because they had no choice.\"\n\n\"Though there was no system of standards governing the trades in the colonies, the method of learning a trade generally followed the apprenticeship guidelines established by the guilds in medieval England and Europe. Women were not excluded from membership in any of the earlier guilds. The Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths in London lists sixty-five \"brethren\" and two \"sistren\" in its 1434 charter.\"\n\nThe paragraph below is a quote from a redditor \"w1g2\" who made a really good point regarding work, and women's involvement in it.\n\nWas it a social norm that most women did not seek out careers as they do now? Sure, I don't doubt it. But women did not have access to reliable birth control (because it hadn't been invented) so unless they wanted to spend the entirety of their life chaste, would have to plan for many of their years being filled with pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, etc. Not to mention, quite a lot of the jobs available weren't in nice air- conditioned offices but involved hard labor or danger like becoming a doctor (working with the near dead, sometimes even people with a plague) or a lawyer (working with criminals, especially when prisons did not have as nice standards for living). Maybe it's the case that in different environments, people, including women, will have to react accordingly to different things and maybe it's understandable that in an environment that used to have far more risk and danger and death and with little knowledge or control over fertility, women wanted different things than they do now.\n\n[https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring04/women.cfm](https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring04/women.cfm)\n\nSo. Women were not nearly as \"oppressed\" as people seem to think they were. There was never a patriarchy holding women down. Were there burdens, obligations and disadvantages? At times, yes. But these usually did not run one way - men too had their own set of burdens. And whenever I mention this to people it's met with handwaving or sometimes outright denial of the evidence.\n\nIt seems to be very hard for a lot of people I've seen to believe that women had a lot more privilege and social power than previously believed, and that men had obligations imposed on them.",

    "text": "A compilation of evidence debunking feminist historical revisionism. I have made a post somewhat similar to this before but I've since collected a lot more information about these topics and so I believe warrants yet another post.\n\n*Myth #1: Women weren't allowed to work.*\n\nMost documentation from the past heavily implies that people attempted to avoid working as much as possible. Even so, many women did work (mostly because they had no choice but to) and there has never been a law restricting women from working.\n\n\"Though creative research has produced evidence of women working at male-dominated occupations in the eighteenth century and before, there is undoubtedly more documentation out there, in newspapers, diaries, legal proceedings, and prints. What is more compelling is the lack of documentation that women were not allowed to work. Although religious practices and social norms might have restricted certain activities in some parts of the world, there were no laws prohibiting women from working a trade.\"\n\nAt the time, only members of a trade guild (associations of producers that trained craft people, maintained control over production, regulated competition and prices) were allowed to sell their goods or practice their skill within the city. Non-guild members were prohibited from selling competitive products. An aspiring master would have to pass through the career chain from apprentice to journeyman before they could be elected to become a master tradesman. They would then have to produce a sum of money and a masterpiece before they could actually join the guild. If the masterpiece was not accepted by the masters, they were not allowed to join the guild, possibly remaining a journeyman for the rest of their life.\n\nWomen were not barred from any of the trade guilds in Britain at least as far back as the 1400s. Apprentice forms for guildwork had spaces left blank to insert 'he' or 'she', though girls who chose this traditional route to mastery of a trade (which was extremely long and arduous) were usually orphaned and had low prospects for marriage, thus they were going to need to work.\n\nMarried women, though, had the privilege of circumventing the long, onerous, arduous process of trade certification as they could receive the master tradesman status from their husbands and thereby continue his work, even take on apprentices to train (which suggests that the social assumption was that wives would learn enough about their husband's business and trade to be able to at least continue to oversee it after he died). Lots of widows continued to run their husbands' businesses long after their death.\n\nThe Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths in London lists sixty-five \"brethren\" and two \"sistren\" in its 1434 charter.\n\nA 1770 publication called *The Tradesman's True Guide or a Universal Directory for the Towns of Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Walsal, Dudley and the manufacturing village in the neighborhood of Birmingham* carried exhaustive lists of tradesmen and tradeswomen alphabetically by name and by trade, and there are women listed in every trade from butcher to wire drawer.\n\n[https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring04/women.cfm](https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring04/women.cfm)\n\nReally, very little I've seen shows that women were maliciously \"kept out\" from trades or professions that they wanted to enter into. It may have been a social norm that most women did not seek out careers as they do now, but looking at the histories of the first women to enter into medicine, law, etc, show that they hardly faced any resistance in doing so.\n\nIn 1847, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman to attend medical school in the US and was the first woman on the Medical Register of the General Medical Council. She sent applications for admission to twelve of the most promising institutions in the northern states, and her application was accepted by the medical department of Geneva University. Feminist revisionist history \"explains\" that she was only admitted to the college by the evil men as a joke, but as will be amply demonstrated this is the opposite of what actually happened.\n\nIn fact, the student body sent her a letter to welcome her:\n\n>At a meeting of the entire medical class of Geneva Medical College, held this day, October 20, 1847, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:‚Äì  \n>  \n>Resolved ‚Äì That one of the radical principles of a Republican Government is the universal education of both sexes; that to every branch of scientific education the door should be open equally to all; that the application of Elizabeth Blackwell to become a member of our class meets our entire approbation; and in extending our unanimous invitation we pledge ourselves that no conduct of ours shall cause her to regret her attendance at this institution.  \n>  \n>2. Resolved ‚Äì That a copy of these proceedings be signed by the chairman and transmitted to Elizabeth Blackwell.\n\nShe describes this letter as one of her most valued possessions, and in her autobiography she states that the men of the college supported her 100% and beyond.\n\n\"The behaviour of the medical class during the two years that I was with them was admirable. It was that of true Christian gentlemen. I learned later that some of them had been inclined to think my application for admission a hoax, perpetrated at their expense by a rival college. But when the *bona-fide* student actually appeared they gave her a manly welcome, and fulfilled to the letter the promise contained in their invitation.\"\n\nShe also notes that the general public also had a favourable view of a woman entering into medicine.\n\n\"The admission of a woman for the first time to a complete medical education and full equality in the privileges and the responsibilities of the profession produced a widespread effect in America. The public press very generally recorded the event, and expressed a favourable opinion of it. Even in Europe some notice of it was taken, and 'Punch' showed his cordial appreciation by his amusing but friendly verses.\"\n\n[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/blackwell/pioneer/pioneer.html?fbclid=IwAR09FZZlnVMVha0PNLYnQQDSnptVDEoGxokEf10QHPCGgxZMly5HyfDlgQI#III](http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/blackwell/pioneer/pioneer.html?fbclid=IwAR09FZZlnVMVha0PNLYnQQDSnptVDEoGxokEf10QHPCGgxZMly5HyfDlgQI#III)\n\nThere are also other examples of women entering into \"male\" fields and encountering little resistance. There's the example of Arabella Mansfield, the first female lawyer in the United States. Although by Iowa law the bar exam was restricted to \"males over 21,\" Arabella Mansfield took the exam in 1869, passing it with high scores. Mansfield challenged the state law excluding her, and the Court ruled that women may not be denied the right to practice law in Iowa, admitting Mansfield to the bar.\n\nOr Ada Lovelace, who was encouraged in her mathematical ability from a young age by her parents and received the best of tutors to increase her ability. She worked with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Machine, though they both \"fell into historical obscurity, and the Analytical Engine was unknown to builders of electro-mechanical and electronic computing machines in the 1930s and 1940s when they began their work, resulting in the need to re-invent many of the architectural innovations Babbage had proposed.\"\n\nOr Amelia Earhart, who was flown \"like a sack of potatoes\" by pilot Wilmer Stultz across the Atlantic in her 1928 transatlantic flight, and immediately became a celebrity, wrote a book about the experience, was used to endorse products, and dubbed 'Lady Lindy'. There is a plaque that marks where the plane landed in Wales. All the fervour over it was solely because she was a woman who crossed the Atlantic regardless of the fact that she didn't do any flying at all in her 1928 flight (She did, however, go on to complete a transatlantic solo flight later on in 1932).\n\n[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia\\_Earhart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Earhart)\n\nOr, for a very long-ago example of this, Murasaki Shikibu from Japan around the year 1000, who listened at the door while her brother received lessons in Chinese writing and through that learned it herself. She was far from reviled for being a woman who knew Chinese and was commissioned by the Empress to write the Tale of Genji, a classic work of Japanese literature often called the world's first novel.\n\nOh, the o p p r e s s i o n .\n\n*Myth #2: Marriage was an institution created by men to oppress women. Men were disproportionately given privilege and power and women were treated like his property in marriage.*\n\nAgain this is a bastardisation of the past. Feminism has to stop treating men as the enemy and as the source of all women's (and also men's) problems. They need to realise that things weren't always as they are now, and realise that it was not Patriarchy or men that restricted the choices of both genders and forced them into strictly defined roles, but that these roles came about because it was the best way of arranging societies in the past - a past that was much harsher and more unforgiving than it is now. A past in which there was more work to do than there were hours in a day. A past where men spent most of their short lives working like mules to support themselves and their families and women spent most of their short lives incapacitated by childbirth and child-rearing. A past in which we sent children into coal mines that ruined their lungs and into factories which lost them limbs. Things sucked, and the reason it was bearable at all back then was *because* of the gender roles.\n\nMen were not the ones who relegated women to the domestic sphere or kept them dependent on men. Biology did. A woman at that time could not simply strike out on her own and do whatever she wanted. For most of history we had no reliable birth control, no safe abortion, no maternity leave, or social security, and most public sphere work back then involved hard labour. And if you were a woman back then who wanted to be able to have sex, then you would have had to plan your life around the idea that you would be getting pregnant, giving birth, and breastfeeding for most of your adult life - and that would have meant you could not be a reliable enough worker to support even yourself, let alone a child, and it would inherently have made you dependent on other people to help you. Until the last 100 years or so, most women could not have lived a life of children and public sphere work, independent of a man (and not all can today, realistically).\n\nEven with support, most women in poor and middle class families had to work because that was the only way to make enough money to live.\n\nSo in a time when single motherhood was a one-way trip to the gutter, marriage was a practical arrangement. The function of marriage was not to oppress women, but to positively assign paternity inasmuch as possible, and then obligate the men so assigned to their children and the mothers of their children. For life.\n\nThe taboo on sex outside of marriage (which was applied to men no less than women) made it difficult for an unscrupulous man to cheat the system. These rules surrounding marriage also mitigated the problem of paternity uncertainty, which maximised men's willingness to invest in their kids. \"I know these are my kids, so I will work hard to feed and shelter them.\" And the reason why we kept lifelong monogamous marriage for so long is because it increased the resources which would have been available to offspring, providing a healthier environment for children to grow up in.\n\nSo when a man married a woman, he was legally obligated to feed, clothe and shelter her and any children produced in the marriage to the best of his ability. Unlike what feminists seem to think, he could not sell her. He could not return her for his money back. He could not drop her at the local midden heap. He could not destroy her the way he could his actual chattels. He could not trade her for a better one. He could not legally neglect her.\n\nJust to make things crystal clear, here is a summary list of entitlements that women enjoyed in marriage (and after marriage) during the old \"patriarchal\" system of the past.\n\n1. When a woman married, she had to hand over her property to her husband's care (again, NOT because she herself was property, but because he was administrator of the family), but he OWED her not just a living, but the best living he was financially capable of providing for her. A wife was entitled to be maintained by her husband.\n2. Though women did not have the right to enter into contracts in their own name in marriage, women had the privilege of the Law of Agency, giving them the legal right to purchase goods on their husbands' credit as their agent. If the wife racked up debts that the husband couldn't pay, she was immune from liability for the debts she racked up - that liability fell to the husband instead.\n3. Women had the entitlement of being protected from prosecution for any number of crimes if they could prove their husbands were aware of said crimes. In which case, he would be prosecuted in her stead--not just held AS responsible as she was, but held solely responsible for her actions. This allowed married women to displace accountability for a large number of offences onto their husbands. \"She's out of control and does what she wants, regardless of my wishes,\" was not a valid legal defence for those men.\n4. Women were exempt from paying taxes, and there was an entire female underground economy of barter and trade that was not subject to taxation or government interference. Even when married women gained the right to hold property within marriage, it was their husbands who were responsible for the taxes owing on it, and it was their husbands who were held 100% financially liable for providing all necessaries to the family, including the wife, even if she made more money than he did.\n5. After divorce, men were held fully financially responsible under the law for the ex-wife and kids. Divorced women were entitled to be supported by their ex-husbands to a level commensurate with the husband's for potentially the rest of their lives unless she remarried.\n\n[https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download\\_file?file\\_format=application/pdf&safe\\_filename=Item.pdf&type\\_of\\_work=Journal%20article](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2e88e3f6-b270-4228-b930-9237c00e739f/download_file?file_format=application/pdf&safe_filename=Item.pdf&type_of_work=Journal%20article)\n\nThat doesn't sound at all like women were treated like property to me.\n\nI'm sorry, but if I have property, I have no legal duty of care toward the actual property I own, nor any obligation to commit to own it until death. I can smash my property on the ground and treat it however I want and it would be my right to do so. Men could not do any of that to the women they were married to. They had obligations towards them to provide for them - even after divorce, and to protect them - even from the consequences of their own actions. Wives had no such obligation towards their husbands - they were entitled to be the ones who were supported. Because the purpose of marriage in the past was not to oppress women and make them the property of men, but to ensure that women and their children could be provided for and protected, and to place the responsibility for that provision and protection on the man even at cost to his own wellbeing, health, and even life. This has been the case since time immemorial.\n\n\"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.\"\n\nEphesians 5.\n\n[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A22-33&version=NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A22-33&version=NIV)\n\nIn fact, many of the supposed \"privileges\" men had in marriage in the past were to help them carry out their obligations and to prevent them from becoming wholly onerous.\n\nIf a man had an obligation to be accountable for provision for his wife and children and to maintain family finances, it stood to reason that he also should have the entitlement of having control over any assets of his marriage, including those his wife brought into the marriage, because he was the one who had a responsibility to keep the entire family afloat and to increase their holdings.\n\nIf a man was responsible for the protection of his wife and children to the point where he could be legally required to stand between his wife and the law within numerous contexts, and be punished in her stead (whether she contracted debts he couldn't pay or committed a crime he would have to answer for), it makes sense why he would be considered head of household and why his family would need to obey him as well as abide by the restrictions he placed on them.\n\nIf, upon divorce, a man would be held solely responsible for the maintenance of his wife and child, it makes sense why he would get custody of the child that he was supporting, as well as ownership of assets so he could satisfy that obligation.\n\nWe gave men these rights and privileges because they were the tools that he needed to satisfy his responsibilities. And in that way there was a balance. \"Women \"got less\" because their obligations and accountability were less, their responsibility was less. Men \"got more\" because the buck stopped with them, whether that buck consisted of a sack of coins or his blood.\"\n\n*Myth #3: Men were allowed to beat their wives with impunity.*\n\nIn the past men were allowed to use \"mild correction\" on their wives under the law (as he was socially and legally responsible for the actions of his wife to the extent that he could even be held accountable for the crimes and offences she committed), but he could not beat her black and blue. Men had restrictions on what corporal punishment they could use on their wives.\n\nIn Colonial America, when men went beyond what was legally acceptable, they received punishment through the pillory. ‚ÄúThe pillory was employed for treason, sedition, arson, blasphemy, witchcraft, perjury, wife beating, cheating, forgery, coin clipping, dice cogging, slandering, conjuring, fortune-telling, and drunkenness, among other offences. On several occasions, onlookers pelted the pilloried prisoner so enthusiastically with heavy missiles that death resulted.‚Äù\n\n[https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring03/branks.cfm](https://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring03/branks.cfm)\n\nThe whipping post also was a favourite form of punishment for wife-beating. Many examples of vigilante justice, sometimes lethal, enacted against wifebeaters can be found in newspaper clippings from the 1800s and onward, with the full endorsement of society.\n\n[https://unapologeticallyantifeminist.video.blog/2019/05/21/correcting-notions-about-domestic-violence-in-history/](https://unapologeticallyantifeminist.video.blog/2019/05/21/correcting-notions-about-domestic-violence-in-history/)\n\nWe can assume that this was practiced in Europe as well. Likewise, Americans practiced shivaree and Europeans practiced charivari as a way to enable social censure of wife-beaters. Charivari was a historical folk custom expressing public disapproval of personal behaviour, where a mock parade was staged through a community accompanied by a discordant mock serenade. Sometimes the crowd would carry an effigy of the targeted man to a substitute punishment, e.g. burning. Sometimes the man who physically abused his wife would be abused by the community.\n\nThey would chant:\n\n*Old Abram Higback has been paying his good woman; But he neither paid her for what or for why, But he up with his fist and blacked her eye.*\n\n*Now all ye old women, and old women kind, Get together, and be in a mind; Collar him, and take him to the shit-house, And shove him over head.*\n\n*Now if that does not mend his manners, The skin of his arse must go to the tanners; And if that does not mend his manners, Take him and hang him on a nail in Hell.*\n\n*And if the nail happens to crack, Down with your flaps, and at him piss.*\n\nHowever, if a husband was beaten by his wife - the husband, in contrast, was also the subject of the charivari for essentially allowing it to happen. In France about 1400, husbands beaten by their wives were ‚Äúparaded on an ass, face to tail.‚Äù¬† In England, a [mural in Montacute House](https://montacutehouse.blogspot.com/2012/04/skimmington-ride.html) (constructed about 1598) shows a wife beating her husband with a shoe and then a crowd parading the husband on a [cowlstaff](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cowlstaff).¬†\n\nSamuel Pepys recorded in his diary, 10 June 1667: ‚Äúin the afternoon took boat and down to Greenwich, where I find the stairs full of people, there being a great riding there to-day for a man, the constable of the town, whose wife beat him.‚Äù\n\nA Frenchman who traveled in England reported in 1698: \"I have sometimes met in the streets of London a woman carrying a figure of straw representing a man, crown‚Äôd with very ample horns, preceded by a drum, and followed by a mob, making a most grating noise with tongs, grid-irons, frying-pans, and sauce-pans. I asked what was the meaning of all this; they told me that a woman had given her husband a sound beating, for accusing her of making him a cuckold, and that upon such occasions some kind neighbour of the poor innocent injur‚Äôd creature generally performed this ceremony.\"\n\n[https://www.purplemotes.net/2013/01/27/charivari-sex-inequality/](https://www.purplemotes.net/2013/01/27/charivari-sex-inequality/)\n\nHmmm. So while a man could give his wife mild correction under the law, if he went too far with wife-beating the community would frown down upon him and punish him with the pillory, whippings and charivari. THERE WAS NO SUCH EXTREME SOCIAL OR LEGAL CENSURE FOR A WIFE WHO BEAT HER HUSBAND. IF SHE BEAT HIM, HE WAS THE ONE WHO WAS PUNISHED.\n\n*Myth #4: Husbands were owed sex with their wives. Marital rape was not illegal, and marriage as an institution was based around rape of women.*\n\nThe idea at the time was that there could not be such a thing as marital rape because as a married person you are owed sex from your spouse, i.e. conjugal rights. This applied to both men and women. People who believe that conjugal rights \"allowed husbands to rape wives\" and not the other way around haven't actually done any research.\n\nIt was based on the idea that **both parties** had a right to sex in the relationship, and this was exercisable in law by each partner in a marriage.\n\nThe Bible said:\n\n\"*It is* good for a man not to touch a woman. **2**¬†Nevertheless, because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. **3**¬†Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband. **4**¬†The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband *does.* And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife *does.* **5**¬†Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.\"\n\n[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7&version=NKJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7&version=NKJV)\n\nDo note the specific passage where it says \"The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband *does.* And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife *does.\"*\n\nAnd here's a quote from an article detailing the history of sex and marriage.\n\n\"A hundred years ago or so, if you took the statute books literally, the only people entitled to have sex with each other were people who were legally married. All other sex was against the law. Fornication (sex with unmarried people) was illegal; so was adultery (sex with a married person‚Äîbut not the person you yourself were married to). Cohabitation‚Äîliving with someone in a sexual relationship‚Äîwas against the law, except for people who were legally married. Enforcement was, shall we say, something less than perfect. At times, it was almost nonexistent. And the rules were riddled with exceptions. Sodomy, on the other hand, was quite a serious crime; and the full weight of the law sometimes came down heavily on people who had gay or lesbian sex.\"\n\n\"Married people were not only *entitled* to have sex; they were, in a way, *required* to have sex. Of course, nobody checked on whether John and Mary were having sex every night, or once a week, or once a month, or never. But if either John or Mary did not perform at all, for whatever reason, the frustrated partner had grounds for divorce; or even perhaps an annulment.\n\n[https://verdict.justia.com/2017/01/24/sex-necessary-legally-speaking](https://verdict.justia.com/2017/01/24/sex-necessary-legally-speaking)\n\nHusbands faced divorce if they were impotent and unable to consummate the marriage, though charges were usually made years after the wedding day. There was a similar charge of frigidity for wives, but it seems that wives charging their husbands for impotency was far more common. Husbands had to show an erection to a court audience and sometimes attempt to perform sex with their wives as well.\n\n[Source 1](http://www.bu.edu/law/journals-archive/bulr/volume89n5/documents/HOFFMAN.pdf) [Source 2](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/05/18/the-hard-on-on-trial/)\n\nBeing incapable of performing sex for your wife could merit corporal punishment. One medieval husband wrote about his unhappy marriage and his impotence in a book called The Lamentations of Little Matheus.\n\n\"My wife wants it, but I can‚Äôt. She petitions for her right. I say no. I just can‚Äôt pay.\"\n\n\"Even given his sexual incapacity, Matheolus was subject to corporal punishment:\n\n\"Acting as her own advocate, Petra {Matheolus‚Äôs wife} puts forward the law that if a shriveled purse {scrotum} can‚Äôt pay because it‚Äôs empty, under statute recompense for that injury is corporal punishment.\"\n\n[https://www.purplemotes.net/2015/05/03/matheolus-church-wife/](https://www.purplemotes.net/2015/05/03/matheolus-church-wife/)\n\nSo what does this show? It shows that both parties had an obligation to provide the other partner with sex during the marriage, and could not deprive their spouse of it. If it was an issue, it was not an issue that solely affected women.\n\n*Myth #5: \"Men had the vote and women did not. Women's suffrage was a matter of women as a united group fighting for their rights against the evil men that kept it from them. Suffragettes were champions of equality who got women the vote. Etc, etc.\"*\n\nReally, I'm very tired of hearing this one.\n\nIn Britain, the right to vote was not only restricted by gender, but also by class. Property owners had the vote, the vast majority of men did not. In 1830, just 3% of the population had the right to vote.\n\nDuring this time, there were a few groups who were fighting for the vote to be extended to them, and one of these groups were the Chartists, who were active from 1830 to 1868. They were fighting for broad electoral reforms including:\n\n* a vote for all men (over 21)\n* the secret ballot\n* no property qualification to become an MP\n* payment for MPs\n* electoral districts of equal size\n* annual elections for Parliament.\n\nThey presented three huge demonstrations to Parliament, and their requests were denied every time. The restrictions were relaxed but not abolished. Benjamin Disraeli said when introducing the Second Reform Act of 1867: \"We do not live ‚Äì and I trust it will never be the fate of this country to live ‚Äì under a democracy. The propositions which I am going to make tonight certainly have no tendency in that direction.\"\n\nThere were also the suffragists and the suffragettes, who were fighting for the vote to be extended to women. Suffragists emerged in the mid-19th century and believed in peaceful, constitutional campaign methods. In the early 20th century, after the suffragists failed to make significant progress, a new generation of activists emerged. These women became known as the suffragettes, and they were willing to take direct, militant action for the cause.\n\nHowever, a huge amount of women disagreed with women's suffrage. So many women objected to the franchise being imposed on them that in the mere 18 months leading up to a 1910 parliamentary debate on women's suffrage, anti-suffragettes had managed to collect 300,000 signatures from women who objected to the franchise being imposed on them. Meanwhile, in the 16 years leading up to that debate, suffragettes only managed to collect 193,000 signatures of women who wanted the vote.\n\nA segment from the transcript of the debate:\n\n\"Still, for what it is worth, one finds that from 1890‚Äì1906 only 193,000 women signed Petitions to this House in favour of female suffrage, and that during the last eighteen months, a period in which a strong anti-suffrage association has been in existence, 300,000 women, some of them eminent women, have signed petitions against it, and to the effect that these proposals shall not be forced upon them.\"\n\nAnd...\n\n\"A rather interesting illustration was furnished by an inquiry which was instituted by \"The Sheffield Independent,\" a newspaper which I think itself is sympathetic with these proposals. This inquiry was addressed to the women householders of Sheffield. Twenty-three thousand papers were sent out, and of the replies 9,000 were in favour of woman suffrage and 14,000 were against it. The representatives of this paper reported that in many cases their emissaries were chased with violence from the houses by the female inhabitants under the impression that they were collecting statistical matter as the emissaries of the suffragist party.\"\n\nIt may be difficult to understand why so many women would reject the vote so vehemently, but this was an era where full citizenship rights like the right to vote were granted only to those with citizenship responsibilities like conscription (and sometimes not even then). In that historical context, the vote was actually viewed not just as a right, but also an obligation. So it was never really about men in power shutting women out of the franchise. It was about government having to decide whether to impose a responsibility on women that women as a whole *clearly did not want.*\n\n[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1910/jul/11/parliamentary-franchise-women-bill](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1910/jul/11/parliamentary-franchise-women-bill)\n\nRegardless of the lack of support for women's suffrage among women, suffragettes became extremely militant in their activism. In 1903 Emmeline Pankhurst founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) with her daughters Christabel and Sylvia, and the WSPU carried out a nationwide bombing and arson campaign. Between 1912 and 1915, hundreds of bombs were left on trains, in theatres, post offices, churches, even outside the Bank of England; while arson attacks on timber yards, railway stations and private houses inflicted an untold amount of damage.\n\n[https://www.historytoday.com/history-matters/sanitising-suffragettes](https://www.historytoday.com/history-matters/sanitising-suffragettes)\n\nInstead of being beneficial in supporting the vote for women, it was disastrous. Lloyd George said: \"The action of the militants is ruinous. The feeling amongst the sympathisers of the cause in the House is one of panic. I am frankly not very hopeful of success if these tactics are persisted in.\"\n\nTerrorism aside, Emmeline Pankhurst was also resistant to acquiring the vote for working class men, realising that this would be much tougher than winning the vote for \"respectable\" AKA upper-class women, and underlying the resistance appears to have been her contempt for working-class men. According to Sean Lang in his book on Parliamentary reform: \"The Pankhursts became stridently anti-male, ruthlessly dropping even the most loyal of their male supporters from the WSPU, and claiming, as Christabel did in her 1913 book¬†*The Great Scourge*, that men were ‚Äúlittle more than carriers of venereal disease‚Äù.\"\n\n[https://conservativewoman.co.uk/men-won-votes-women-not-suffragettes/](https://conservativewoman.co.uk/men-won-votes-women-not-suffragettes/)\n\nWhen WW1 came around in 1914, suffragettes also threw their support behind the White Feather campaign with the aim of shaming men into enlisting. Those young women went in for the kill, striking men at the very heart of their masculine identities, the bestowing of a feather telling them, \"If you don't go off to be maimed or die, you are no longer a man in the eyes of some brassy chit you've never even met before and will probably never see again.\" And many men went, because a woman's censure - ANY woman's censure - had the power to drive them straight into the teeth of death.\n\nBy mid 1915, it was clear that not enough men were signing up to replace the fatalities on the front line, and the Military Service Act was introduced in January 1916. By March 1916 compulsory conscription for all single men aged 18-41 was in place. In May 1916, the Act was extended to include conscription for married men.\n\n[http://www.eastsussexww1.org.uk/attitudes-towards-conscription/index.html](http://www.eastsussexww1.org.uk/attitudes-towards-conscription/index.html)\n\nIt was only at that point that the British government considered extending the vote to all men, as most of the propertyless, working class men that were conscripted into war during WW1 did not have the right to vote, and this was finally starting to be seen as the injustice that it was. In the trenches class divisions were eroded to the extent that class no longer had any real meaning and every man was the equal of each other in terms of sacrifice and service to one's country.\n\nMen got universal suffrage in 1918 with the Representation of the People Act, which enfranchised more than five million men over the age of 21 without regard to property or class. Women of all classes were piggybacked onto the Act, with an age restriction temporarily in place to prevent women from becoming a supermajority voting bloc, given that about 1 million British men had died in the war. Regardless, this brought more than eight million women over 30 into the electorate. And just ten years later, the 1928 Act (the act which gave women electoral equality) gave the vote to women at age 21, which added another five million women to the electorate.\n\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/has-everyone-forgotten-male-suffrage/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/has-everyone-forgotten-male-suffrage/)\n\nIntroducing the 1918 Bill, the Home Secretary George Cave said: \"War by all classes of our countrymen has brought us nearer together, has opened men's eyes, and removed misunderstandings on all sides. It has made it, I think, impossible that ever again, at all events in the lifetime of the present generation, there should be a revival of the old class feeling which was responsible for so much, and, among other things, for the exclusion for a period, of so many of our population from the class of electors. I think I need say no more to justify this extension of the franchise.\"\n\nThe Act was achieved not by the suffragettes‚Äô terrorist tactics, but by fighting of men in WW1, when thousands of men from their many different backgrounds came together to fight the common enemy. This finally achieved what the Chartists, the Levellers and the peasants before them had struggled for in terms of eroding barriers of class. Without the sacrifice of men who endured the horror of trench warfare in WW1, class barriers would have persisted and at most the vote would have been extended only to elite, wealthy, propertied women.\n\nIn a later study of attitudes to conscription in 1939, one woman responded: \"In the last war \\[(WW1)\\] I never told one man that he ought to go. I tried to put myself in their place. If I‚Äôd been them I wouldn‚Äôt have gone. When I saw them going through the streets ‚Äì all the young men ‚Äì I used to think that they were being driven like cattle to the slaughter house. And they were, weren‚Äôt they? Fodder for the guns.\"\n\nThe common idea that all men had the vote, and that women did not, and that women's suffrage was a fight of women who were united against men working as an oppressive force to keep them down is an affront to these men who died in a literal war that secured universal suffrage for everyone (many of which, in fact, did not have the vote). It also ignores and erases the will and sentiment of many, many,¬†*many*¬†anti-suffragette women who actively rejected the vote and protested vehemently against it being imposed on them.\n\nFurthermore, the view that suffragettes were a valiant, fair-minded, equality-oriented group who got women the vote and whose activism merely amounted to firecrackers in barrels is an affront to any right-thinking person. The real violence and extremism of the suffragettes is barely, if at all, recognised by the general public, and this is partly due to attempts by suffragettes to sanitise their history.\n\n\"Laura E. Nym Mayhall, in her work on the militant suffrage movement, identified the importance of \"a small group of former suffragettes\" in the 1920s and 1930s, who created a highly stylised story of the WSPU and the history of suffrage in England, which emphasised \"women‚Äôs martyrdom and passivity\". The group set about compiling the documents, memoirs and memorabilia that now form the basis of the Suffragette Fellowship Collection held by the Museum of London.\"\n\n[https://www.historytoday.com/history-matters/sanitising-suffragettes](https://www.historytoday.com/history-matters/sanitising-suffragettes)\n\nAnd here we are now, in crazy world. According to the dominant narrative, all men always had the vote since the dawn of recorded human history, and they refused to give it to women because penis. The demonstrations of the Chartists, and the dead bodies of these men that were sacrificed to the unpopular idea of male suffrage (and who got votes for women in the process), have gone down the memory hole. The terroristic actions of the suffragettes, engaged in for the benefit of wealthy and privileged women only and for which they were barely punished, are the noblest of acts for the noblest of causes. And of course, the only reason anyone could EVER have opposed them was because of misogyny.\n\nedit: wording\n\nedit 2: Added some extracts from [w1g2's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/edyrf5/a_compilation_of_evidence_debunking_feminist/fbtays6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).",

    "text": "It is now males, rather than females, who suffer the vast majority of institutional discrimination This post was originally submitted by u/Vwar. For new subscribers, here it is again.\n\n---\n\nI don't believe that males have ever been [privileged](https://www.amazon.ca/Privileged-Sex-Martin-van-Creveld/dp/1484983122) in the way feminists claim.   But we are now at the point where the deck is stacked against males at every stage of their lives and in almost every major institution.   \n\nWhen a male is born he can have his genitals mutilated. Hundreds of baby boys die from this procedure every year.\n\nThen comes primary school, where boys are often punished and even drugged for displaying natural boyish behavior. Recent studies have also revealed that female teachers mark down boys by an average of 20 percent for the same work.\n\nHuge numbers of boys are now being raised without fathers (including about 99 percent of school shooters, funny how we never talk about that), and since pedo hysteria has chased male teachers out of primary school, boys often don't have any male role models until much later in life.\n\nBoys only clubs (eg the Boy Scouts) are being eliminated while girl only clubs remain.\n\nTeenage boys are being introduced to blatantly misandrist concepts like \"toxic masculinity,\" with narry a word about toxic femininity and nothing about the positive aspects of masculinity.\n\nNext it's off to University, where there are a range of female-specific scholarships and programs even though women make up the majority of college students and young women are now out-earning young men. They are also portrayed as rapists in waiting, and there are entire departments (gender studies) devoted to demonizing their sex. If a young man pisses off a young woman (eg dumps her after a one night stand) he faces the possibility of being subjected to a false accusation and a feminist Kangaroo court. Then it's bye bye academic career and social reputation.\n\nIf he wants to vote he will have to sign over his body to the state (selective service).\n\nIf he gets a woman pregnant he will not have the option of legal parental surrender. While a woman can just drop off the baby at a safe haven, the man is on the hook for 18 years of child support and will be locked up if he loses his job and can't pay.\n\nIn the workplace things are just as bad. Men perform almost all of the dirty and dangerous jobs and make up 95 percent of workplace injuries and deaths. If a white man wants to pursue a more respected career he faces racial and sexual discrimination in hiring due to corporate \"diversity\" measures and quotas. A recent study in...I think it was Australia found that \"blind hiring\" practices (where the employer doesn't know the race or sex of the applicant) result in more straight white males being hired; this means that it is straight white men who are now suffering discrimination in the workplace.\n\nWith MeToo, a man can be fired from his job simply for making a woman uncomfortable. There have even been cases of men being fired for telling a naughty joke.\n\nIf he gets married and the wife divorces him through no fault of his own he will likely be treated like shit by the family courts unless he can afford a high priced lawyer. There are countless stories of men effectively being turned into indentured servants by their ex-wives; they live in poverty and seldom see their kids while the wife gets a new \"baby daddy\" and lives high on the hog. NOW, the largest feminist organization in the world, continues to oppose shared parenting even though every single study shows it to be in the best interests of the children, the father and even the mother.\n\nHe will receive less social support, less health care spending, and be relentlessly demonized in the media. \n\nIf a male is sexually assaulted by a woman he will probably not receive justice; the perp will likely get a slap on the wrist even if the victim is a boy.  \n\nIf he commits a crime or is falsely accused of a crime he will be treated much, much more harshly by the criminal justice system.\n\nI could go on.\n\nIt is a myth that feminists think the sexes are equal. Their MO goes like this: if men are ahead in some area, that means women are being oppressed because the sexes are identical except for genitalia; however, if women are ahead in some area that's because women are superior. You can find this sentiment going back to the first wave. Elizabeth Cady Stanton claimed that women are \"infinitely superior\" to men.\n\nThe prison thing is perhaps the most glaring example of feminists not practicing what they preach. If they were serious about equality they would be demanding either that men be treated with more compassion/leniency or that women be treated more harshly (or some combination of the two). Instead, they want women to be treated even *more* leniently, and some are even advocating for the complete abolition of female prisons.\n\nMen are increasingly second class citizens not only in a social but legal sense. A study in the UK determined that if women were treated like men by the criminal justice system, fully half of all prisoners would be female. Women do NOT commit less crimes than men (though they do commit less homicides), they just don't get punished to anywhere near the same extent.\n\nIf feminism were an \"equality\" movement they would not be trying to privilege females in every single institution.    They would be looking with a keen eye at areas in which males are disadvantaged and/or subject to institutional discrimination.   They certainly wouldn't blame everything on some nebulous all-encompassing \"patriarchy\" that hasn't even been proven to exist.  \n\nAdvocates of gender equality must reject feminism, and support men's rights.",

I felt a special obligation to hammer away  at gender myths such as intimate partner violence (women are about [as likely as men](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062022/) to initiate violence against their partners as men), false sexual allegations (a [disturbing percentage](https://medium.com/t/@jimpreston_36730/how-many-rape-accusations-are-false-f52e4c675f2a) of such allegations) and demonstrable [bias against fathers](https://theccf.ca/ideology-and-dysfunction-in-family-law/)  in family court, because male journalists who dared to write  sympathetically about men and/or critically about women put their  careers in jeopardy (no exaggeration), and most had learned to keep *shtumm* in this domain.\n\nThat  situation has been changing slowly but steadily. Some men have decided  they aren‚Äôt going to spend their lives in rhetorical purdah on the  subject of their own cultural dhimmitude, and have been stepping up to  the plate, whatever the personal cost. The university campus is home to  the feminist commissariat‚Äîand it‚Äôs a brave man who dares to stick his  head above that formidable parapet. Because the cost of doing so can be  high.\n\nThis is the story of one such activist who paid a price,  which only fueled his resistance efforts, and which in turn inspired  others, in reversing a decades-long erosion of men‚Äôs rights on campus.\n\nIn  a meeting held in June, 2017, Kursat Christoff Pekgoz was pressured by  his academic director at the University of Southern California into  terminating his PhD degree in English Literature on what Pekgoz  considered spurious and unprecedented grounds, accompanied by ‚Äúmany  threats and irrational exaggerations‚Äù (the meeting was recorded).¬† His  contract was not renewed and his funding was cut off. This is extremely  uncommon. In fact, Pekgoz is unaware of any other PhD student being  denied a doctoral degree in English Literature \\[at USC\\].\n\nThe real  reason for his PhD termination, Pekgoz alleges, is his history of gender  activism via a series of Title IX complaints against a number of  universities, such as Rutgers, [Northeastern](http://ncfm.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NCFM-Title-IX-complaint-Northeastern-University.pdf) and Georgetown, to which he added [one against USC](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/ea7b71_0c223159779e4beaaea809873f2504a7.pdf) at the end of May. As he [told a PJ Media reporter](https://pjmedia.com/trending/ph-d-student-files-federal-complaint-says-usc-retaliated-against-his-pro-men-title-ix-activism/), ‚ÄúThey all know that I am a Title IX activist for men, with strong libertarian/conservative views.‚Äù¬†\n\nTitle  IX‚Äôs language is very plain. It prohibits any institution from funding,  sponsoring, or listing gender-discriminatory programs and initiatives,  so for example, even listing a woman-only scholarship or placing an  employment ad specifying only women need apply runs counter to Title IX,  though such breaches happen all the time. Title IX also prohibits  discrimination in terms of counselling or health benefits. That should  mean that both men and women are treated with equal objectivity and  respect when, say, sexual-assault allegations come up for assessment.  But universities have [not covered themselves in glory](https://helpsaveoursons.com/category/fighting-back/), to say the least, on that front.¬†\n\nIndeed,  motivation for Pekgoz‚Äôs robust activism arose in part from a Title IX  complaint against him for sexual harassment. In response, he went on  offence with a forceful and persuasive [counter-charge](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/ea7b71_16c1692eab8844218afdb2b419622827.pdf)  that his accuser had in fact sexually assaulted him (it‚Äôs worth  reading, because it offers a formidable sample of the kind of meticulous  research and annotation Pekgoz applies to every single thing he says  and writes. It does not seem to leave much wriggle room for his accuser,  and I think any objective reader would come away from it with,  minimally, doubts as to the accuser‚Äôs credibility.)¬†\n\nIn 2018  Pekgoz complained to the Department of Education‚Äôs Office of Civil  Rights (OCR) about both USC and Yale University, prompting an  investigation into both schools‚Äô women-only scholarships and programs,  such as a USC Women in Science and engineering group that excludes  males.\n\nLast January, Pekgoz and two former lawyers (not affiliated with Harvard University) filed a Title IX [complaint with the OCR against Harvard](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/ea7b71_85533d99ee0748ac813ca937735a4f94.pdf),  in which they rebut the received wisdom of female victimhood with an  abundance of impeccably-sourced evidence demonstrating the various ways  in which men are discriminated against in society and on campus.  Notably, ‚Äúthe overwhelming majority of all persons sanctioned under  Title IX theory are male. However, there is good evidence that men and  women experience sexual victimization at equal rates and the majority of  male victims [report female perpetrators](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1752928X11001569). The majority of Title IX administrators are women.‚Äù\n\nAlso in the Harvard complaint is a reference to Supreme Court prohibitions against male-gender discrimination. In [*Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan*,](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mississippi-University-for-Women-v-Hogan)  for example, the Supreme Court held that denying male admission to  nursing courses was impermissible under the Equal Protection Clause of  the Fourteenth Amendment. They wrote that a sex classification must be  ‚Äú‚Ä¶determined through reasoned analysis rather than through the  mechanical application of traditional, often inaccurate, assumptions  about the proper roles of men and women. ‚Ä¶ Thus, if the statutory  objective is to exclude or ‚Äòprotect‚Äô members of one gender because they  are presumed to suffer from an inherent handicap or to be innately  inferior, the objective itself is illegitimate.‚Äù This statement would  seem to undermine the reflexive argument adduced by feminists that  affirmative action for women is still necessary because of historic  disadvantage or because there are more *Fortune 500* male CEOs than women.\n\nThe  most interesting complaint to the OCR, because it reveals the distance  the men‚Äôs rights movement has come from its first tentative and atomized  beginnings two decades ago, is the one led by Pekgoz [against Cornell University](https://www.scribd.com/document/399202262/Coalition-Complaint#from_embed) in February, which Pekgoz described in an¬† [interview with *Campus Reform*](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=11853) as ‚Äúone of the worst in the nation‚Äù for anti-male bias.¬†\n\nThe  document contains a ‚Äúlist of exclusionary programs‚Äù at Cornell, such as  the lack of a Men‚Äôs Resource Center to balance the women‚Äôs Center, or a  Men‚Äôs Health Center to balance the Iris Cantor Women‚Äôs Health Center.  Likewise ‚Äì even though ‚Äúmen are twice as likely to have heart attacks  through life than women‚Äù ‚Äì there is a women‚Äôs Heart Program, but none  for men.\n\nBut the list itself, while interesting, is not what is  most significant about the Cornell complaint. Rather it is the public  support for the complaint amongst Pekgoz‚Äôs colleagues and from many  respected public intellectuals, such as American Enterprise Institute  scholar and feminist critic [Christina Hoff Summers](https://www.aei.org/author/christina-hoff-sommers/),  that lend unusual moral weight to its claims. More than 185 professors,  scholars and activists signed on to it, including Canada‚Äôs own Jordan  B. Peterson, arguably the most recognizable and inspirational spokesman  for gender equality in the world today. Peterson referenced Title IX‚Äôs  long association with women‚Äôs rights succinctly: ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs sauce for the  goose is sauce for the gander.‚Äù\n\nPeter Wood, president of the National Association of Scholars, told *Campus Reform*  that he had signed the complaint because it ‚Äúaddresses a fundamental  unfairness in contemporary America, centred in our colleges and  universities‚Äù and because ‚Äúit shows that exclusionary practices create a  hostile environment‚Äù for men, some caused by an ‚Äúanimus against males  perpetrated by feminist ideology.‚Äù Lawrence Alexander, a law professor  at the University of San Diego, told *Campus Reform* that he signed because ‚Äúits allegations are true and even understated.‚Äù\n\nSuch  public affirmation on men‚Äôs behalf by high-status academics in  prestigious institutions represents something like a tipping point in  the gender wars, it seems to me. Margaret C. Valois, a Virginia-based  Title IX attorney who specializes in defending accused male students  filed a similar Title IX complaint against Tulane University and [obtained a win](http://www.aei.org/publication/successful-title-ix-complaint-forces-tulane-university-to-end-gender-discrimination/)  recently. Valois, Pekgoz and another aggressive veteran in the battle  for gender equality, Professor Mark Perry of the University of  Michigan-Flint, are profiled by anti-feminist Canadian vlogger Janice  Fiamengo, a signatory to the Cornell complaint, in [Episode 94 of her popular Fiamengo File](https://inclip.top/studiobrule/aLDRY3qCkmjIuoI/will-2019-be-the-year-of-mra-lawsuits-tff-episode-94.html) series, titled ‚ÄúWill 2019 Be the Year of MRA Lawsuits?‚Äù\n\nWill  it? It does seem that we are at a pivotal moment‚Äîthat there is a  powerful current of social unease, running just below the still  hegemonically feminist surface, with the unfettered misandry that  pervades our culture. In Pekgoz‚Äôs Harvard complaint, for example, he  notes that whenever the Department of education investigates an  institution for anti-male discrimination, public attitudes on the issue  are on the side of men: ‚Äú\\[A\\]ccording to a recent poll conducted by  YouGov, 69% of all Americans believe that men face discrimination to  some extent. 74% of men believe that such discrimination occurs, while  63% of women agree that men face some degree of discrimination.‚Äù\n\nFiamengo points to what she ([and I](http://www.barbarakay.ca/articles/view/1297)) consider radical feminism‚Äôs shark-jumping moment, the publication in the *Washington Post* of Northeastern University academic Suzanna Danuta Walters‚Äôs odiously misandric June, 2018 article, ‚Äú[Why can‚Äôt we hate men](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-cant-we-hate-men/2018/06/08/f1a3a8e0-6451-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html)?‚Äù which earned her a [Title IX complaint](https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=11249) filed by the National Coalition for Men [(NCFM).](https://ncfm.org/)  Walters doubtless expected her screed would find the passive acceptance  such anti-male rants often have done in the past, but was clearly  startled by the fierce blowback she received.\n\nA final word about  Kursat Christoff Pekgoz. I don‚Äôt know him personally, but from his  history, I would say that the USC Literature department picked the wrong  guy to tangle with when they forced him out of his PhD program. This is  a young man, now 30-something, who comes from Turkey, a land where they  play political hardball, and backing the wrong horse can earn you  something worse than a Twitter mobbing. He learned about activism in  what we might call an ‚Äúunsafe space.‚Äù\n\nPekgoz‚Äôs [*curriculum vitae*](https://www.kursatchristoffpekgoz.com/)  informs us that In Turkey Pekgoz went out on potentially dangerous  political limbs. He took part in the Republic protests of 2007 against  fundamentalist Islam, as well as a protest against Islamist hate speech  targeting Armenian and Jewish minorities in 2009, amongst other forays.  He advocated against electoral fraud by the Islamist regime. He taught *pro bono* for an anti-Islamist organization that seeks to eliminate illiteracy among young women in Ankara (real feminism in action).¬†\n\nAll  this speaks to character. For relentless discipline and determination  in achieving goals, add this salient fact: As a long-distance swimmer,  Pekgoz has covered 11,000 m in the open sea, with the best speed of  5,000 m in 130 minutes. This is in seawater with a temperature of 17C.  Don‚Äôt look to such a man to truckle to latte-sipping ideologues  trafficking in gender injustice. Ever.\n\nAccording to his bio,  Pekgoz has ‚Äúperfect pitch.‚Äù He means musically, of course. But it may be  the case that he has perfect cultural pitch as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.thepostmillennial.com/one-brave-young-man-takes-on-gender-inequality-at-usc/](https://www.thepostmillennial.com/one-brave-young-man-takes-on-gender-inequality-at-usc/)",

    "text": "List of Men's Rights Issues Just what I see as important, with a few sources.\n\n###Labor, work / life balance\n* Men work longer hours than women\n* Men work more difficult jobs than women\n* Men suffer from greater rates of occupational health problems (black lung disease, mesotheleoma, etc)\n* Men are more likely to die on the job\n* Men receive fewer benefits like paid time off, paid medical leave, and health insurance\n* Men have less free time to see a doctor, and often do not have medical coverage to pay for a doctor\n* As a result of many of the above, men live shorter, disease ridden lives, but retirement age is the same as (and sometimes higher than) women\n\n###Household responsibilities\n* Men do most of the dangerous, dirty, and difficult work around the home\n* Men get nagged, harassed, and bossed around inside their home ([source 1](https://public.psych.iastate.edu/ccutrona/psych592a/articles/Vogel%202007.pdf), [source 2](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2008/09/25/women-call-the-shots-at-home-public-mixed-on-gender-roles-in-jobs/), [source 3](https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle-2-15039/women-decide-to-rule-the-roost-1-1503380))\n* The total amount of time men spend at work and at home doing chores and child care is more than the amount of time women spend on these activities ([source 1 (Pew)](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/12/fathers-day-facts/ft_18-05-01_fathersday_time/), [source 2 (US BLS)](https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4635193/Screen_Shot_2014-06-18_at_12.56.18_PM.png), [source 3](https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-myth-of-the-lazy-father))\n* Men have less time to themselves for leisure, self care, napping, and sleeping, compared to women (source: same as above)\n* The way society views all of the above is completely backwards: women complain about men and about the amount of work that men do, often portraying men as lazy or incompetent (see [source 3](https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-myth-of-the-lazy-father) from above), despite the fact that, if anyone has room to complain, it's men, not women\n\n###Masculinity and Misandry\n* Men are attacked for behaving like men.  Husbands are attacked for behaving like husbands.  Fathers are attacked for behaving like fathers.  And boys are attacked (and often medicated, shamed, and disciplined) for behaving like boys.\n* The vast majority of media representations of men in TV, movies, and commercials, are negative ([source (from rbomi)](https://archive.is/NHC61))\n* Even when men are portrayed positively in the media, it's usually because they have abandoned masculine traits and embraced feminine traits instead (so a man is seen as a bad guy when he was acting like a man, and later a good guy when he \"connects with his feminine side\") (source: same as above)\n* Misandry is widespread throughout all of society and is widely accepted.  Many people do not know when they are being misandrist, or that it's even possible to be misandrist.\n* Men are shamed and attacked with words like *creep*, *pervert*, *incel*, *deadbeat*,and *rapist*\n* These types of slurs should be considered equally sexist / bigoted as words like \"thug\" for black people or \"wetback\" for hispanics\n* Men's behavior is highly regulated by women and female shaming behavior\n* The clothing that men are allowed to wear is highly regulated by women and female shaming behavior\n* It is not uncommon to hear comments about the size of a man's penis, or for women to threaten to cut off a man's penis\n* Genital mutilation is commonly used to \"fix\" behavioral \"problems\" in young boys\n\n###Education\n* Our school systems are increasingly hostile towards boys\n* Boys are treated like defective girls and their behaviors are \"corrected\" through discipline, and through medication, so that they will behave more like girls\n* Boys make worse grades than girls, and graduate at lower rates than girls (despite, in the past, doing better than girls)\n* Our education system went through several reforms to help out girls, and these reforms are responsponsible for making things worse for boys ([source](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/05/the-war-against-boys/304659/))\n* Society is hesitant to address or fix any of these issues, despite the fact that we were willing to fix these issues when they first effected girls\n\n###Wealth gap\n* Single women make more money than single men\n* Millennial women make more money than millennial men\n* Women as a whole own more wealth than men do -- most \"money\" in society belongs to women ([source 1](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/bmo-report-despite-controlling-14-trillion-in-wealth-american-women-still-have-challenges-to-overcome-2015-04-02-13173119), [source 2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2010/07/28/women-making-economic-strides-and-not-slowing-down/)).\n* The expectation is for men to spend money on women, not the reverse\n* Women spend their boyfriend's and husband's money, often even when they make more than their boyfriend / husband\n* Women very often receive large portions of a man's assets and future income in a divorce, which contributes significantly to the wealth gap\n\n###Divorce and child custody\n* Courts have an obvious anti-male bias when it comes to divorce settlmenets, child custody cases, and awarding child support\n* Laws concerning marriage, divorce, child custody, and child support, are sexist, and often times name \"husband / wife\" and \"father / mother\" directly in the legal language\n* Even when this is not the case, the effect of these laws are still sexist, in much the same way that drug laws and drug enforcement have been acused of being racist ([source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Jim_Crow))\n* Women should not be allowed to walk away with a substantial amount of the man's money and assets from a divorce\n* Women should be forced to work a job instead of receiving child support, alimony, and welfare\n* Men should receive default 50 / 50 custody without having to pay child support.  Men should not have to go to court, pay court fees, hire lawyers, and argue their case in court.\n* It is not fair for a man to work full time, take 50% of the child rearing responsibilities, and still pay child support.  If a man can work and still put in his fair share, then so can a woman.\n\n###Police brutality and legal discrimination\n* Men are discriminated against in almost every aspect of the legal system.  In many cases this discrimination is *worse* than it is for minorities.\n\n###Domestic abuse, rape, and violence against men\n* The Deluth model of domestic abuse is overtly sexist against men\n* Women physically assault men at equal and sometimes greater rates than the reverse\n* Domestic abuse that includes yelling, gaslighting, and emotional abuse, are probably much higher than what's reported, and men likely make up a majority of the victims\n* Nagging, harassing, henpecking, and bossy behavior from wives and SOs should be counted as domestic abuse\n* Taking advantage of a man for his money should be considered a form of \"financial abuse\"\n* Men are raped at equal rates as women but there is very little awareness for this.  Most men are raped by women, not by other men ([source 1](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known/), [source 2](http://webshare.law.ucla.edu/Faculty/bibs/stemple/Stemple-SexualVictimizationPerpetratedFinal.pdf)).\n* Men are viewed as being more dangerous or violent than women, despite there being clear gender parity when it comes to domestic abuse and sexual assault\n* As a result, men receive less support and there is less awareness for these problems in comparison to women\n* Men who are raped suffer from greater rates of emotional trauma than women do\n* Women who rape men tend to be more violent and are more likely to use force than men.\n* There is a widespread and rampant \"rape culture\" against men: many women do not believe that it is possible to rape a man, and as a result women are more likely to step over boundaries in ways that men don't.\n* Many people do not view abusive behaviors from women in the same light as those same behaviors from men ([source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8006596_Psychologists'_Judgments_of_Psychologically_Aggressive_Actions_When_Perpetrated_by_a_Husband_Versus_a_Wife))\n* Men are often viewed as the more responsible party than women\n\n###Men and Minorities\n* Many areas of men's rights and minority rights intersect, with minority men facing problems from both racism and sexism\n* Examples include police profiling, police brutality, and racist / sexist comments and behaviors\n* Men are often treated like criminals, and this treatment is even worse for minority men\n* White men perform worse than white women in almost every single aspect of life, with the exception of job earnings (which is largely the result of men working more hours, more difficult jobs, and having a worse work/life balance compared to women)\n* Minority men perform worse than minority women in every single metric you can look at, including job earnings\n* Minority women perform better than white men in some areas, like when it comes to police brutality, police profiling, and discrimination in the court system\n* Who has it worse: Men, or minorities?  Obviously it is minority men.  It is not true that minority women have things worse.\n* Joking about minority women somehow having things worse has created a culture of denial over men's issues and the problems that minority men face.",
