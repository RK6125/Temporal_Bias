    "text": "Do you think minorities are well represented in this industry?  This is probably a more US-centric question, but I guess could apply to the rest of the West.\n\nI don't see many latino/as and black people in software development except for maybe one per medium sized company or one out of a 100. They seem to be more represented in hardware IT.\n\nAmong minorities, I definitely see many Indians and Chinese men on the software side and many of them have gained the highest positions in companies (Microsoft CEO, Alphabet CEO, Nvidia CEO, etc.). Off the top of my head, I can't even think of a black or hispanic CEO in tech or among tech VCs.\n\nAmong white women, the representation is growing, but not necessarily in dev. It's usually positions like PM, UX or maybe front-end dev. Chinese and Indian women are more represented on the software side, though I've seen it more in quality than development. As for black and latina women, I've only seen representation in the Bay Area and even then, that's next to nothing.\n\nI know there are hiring biases and other factors that get in the way such as CTCI tests, salaries, perceptions, lack of interest among the groups, social climate and so on.\n\nDoes anyone here think it's a problem that can ever be fixed? Doesn't think it's a problem at all? I'm trying to get perspectives for career reasons.",
