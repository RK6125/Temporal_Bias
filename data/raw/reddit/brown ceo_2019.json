So recently I was transferred to the top floor of my office building (Financial Institution) which is where all of the C-Level executive's offices are. And occasionally some mornings i'll just so happen to ride up alone to the top floor with one of them. Its 42 floors so its quite a long ride up for there not to be any talking. This morning I happened to get in with the CFO and was just trying to chat a little and he seemed completely disconnected and uninterested. I rode up with the CEO Tuesday and he actually took interest in me and asked what department I was in, how long I've been with the company and so on. But last week I rode up with the Chief of Staff and she didn't even acknowledge my presence or the fact i said good morning to her, I was shocked!\n\nSo my question really is, how do you treat C-Levels? Say nothing? Keep trying? I don't want to come off like i'm brown nosing because its not my intention. Its just that this the first job I've ever had where i see the leaders of the company on a daily basis so i don't know how to go about it.",

The CEO has just launched a company awards scheme and you can nominate people if you think they deserve them.\n\nI wanted to nominate my line manager for the 'mentor' award because they've effectively created an unofficial mentoring program with me and has taken a real interest in my career progression which I'm incredibly grateful for.\n\nThe problem is is that it's a small team and the nominations process isn't anonymous. I want to do a nice thing for my line manager, however I don't want to get a reputation as a brown noser or a suck up, especially given the size of the team. People can be extremely petty, and whilst we have a great working relationship, we've struggled as a department with other departments before. \n\nIf anyone has any words of wisdom that would be greatly appreciated! \n\nShould I nominate her regardless of any effect this might have on my reputation amongst the larger organisation or should I find an alternative way to show how appreciative I am of her efforts?\n\nThanks!",
