    "text": "What are your \"vintage\" film faves that have a black/afrocentric focus? I just spent time watching A Warm December on TCM (Turner Classic Movies) this afternoon. \n\nThe film is from 1973, and has a lot of things that would be problematic by today's standards,  but it was still nice to watch a cozy romance on a Sunday afternoon. \n\n\n* problematic points include creating a fictional African country and populating it with a mish-mash of South African (music cameos),  east African (random Swahili sound bytes), and Francophone west African /Senegalese (clothing) cultural references. \n\nThe black cast is predominantly afro-Caribbean, so the accents don't quite hit either, and the lead actress is clearly wearing a foundation that darkens her natural skin tone to make her fit the role (think Zoe Saldana as Nina Simone).\n\nAll that aside, the love story is sweet, the wardrobe actually got me thinking of how I could incorporate more vintage looks in my style this summer, and it was interesting to see a black film from 50 years ago.  \n\nLead actress, Esther Andserson, won a NAACP Image Award for her performance (Best Actress category).  \n\nBonus points for a gratuitously topless scene featuring Sidney Poitier strolling through an English meadow. His companions are in long sleeve tops/turtlenecks, so it wasn't THAT warm,  but ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Sidney could get it, and he was the director, so I'm not complaining.",
